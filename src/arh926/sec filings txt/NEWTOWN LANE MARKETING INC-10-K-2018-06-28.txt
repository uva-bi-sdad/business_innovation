PART

THE
COMPANY&rsquo;S HISTORY

Newtown
Lane Marketing
 Incorporated&nbsp;(&ldquo;we&rdquo;
 &ldquo;our&rdquo;
 &ldquo;us&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;Newtown&rdquo;) was incorporated
in Delaware on September 26
 2005. We are a corporation with limited operations and have very limited revenues from our business
operations since our incorporation in September 2005. Until December 31
 2007
 we held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen&rsquo;s
Donut Brand in the United States with the exception of the states of Florida and Pennsylvania
 and in Suffolk County
 New York
which Dreesen retained for itself. In August 2007 there was a change in control
 as detailed below
 and we discontinued our efforts
to promote the Dreesen&rsquo;s Donut Brand at that time. The license from Dreesen expired on December 31
 2007.

On
August 29
 2008
 we implemented a 1 for 50 reverse stock split (the &ldquo;Reverse Split&rdquo;) of our Common Stock. Pursuant
to the Reverse Split
 each 50 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding was converted into one share of Common Stock.

Effective
August 15
 2013
 we declared and paid a stock dividend on our outstanding Common Stock to stockholders of record as of August
15
 2013 (the &ldquo;Record Date&rdquo;). As a result
 all stockholders on the Record Date received nine new shares of Common
Stock for each share of Common Stock owned by them as of the that date (the &ldquo;2013 Stock Dividend&rdquo;).

All
share and per share data contained in this Report has been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Split and the 2013 Stock
Dividend and all fractional shares
 if any
 as a result thereof have been rounded upward to the next whole share.

As
of March 31
 2018
 our authorized capital stock consisted of 100
000
000 shares of Common Stock and 1
000
000 shares of Preferred
Stock of which 13
757
550 shares of Common Stock
 and no shares of Preferred Stock
 were issued and outstanding. All shares of
Common Stock currently outstanding are validly issued
 fully paid and non-assessable.

CHANGE
OF OWNERSHIP TRANSACTIONS

On
August 8
 2007 (the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;)
 we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;Purchase Agreement&rdquo;)
with Moyo Partners
 LLC
 a New York limited liability company (&ldquo;Moyo&rdquo;) and R&amp;R Biotech Partners
 LLC
 a Delaware
limited liability company (&ldquo;R&amp;R&rdquo; collectively with Moyo
 the &ldquo;Purchasers&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which we sold
to them
 in the aggregate
 approximately
 four million four hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4
479
250) shares
of our common stock
of
our Series A Preferred Stock
 par value $.001 per share (&ldquo;Series A Preferred Stock&rdquo;)
 each share convertible at the
option of the holder into
 approximately
 fourteen thousand eight hundred twenty (14
820) shares of Common Stock
 for aggregate
proceeds to us of $600
000. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible only to the extent there
were a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon any such conversion.

On
the Effective Date: (i) the Purchasers acquired control of Newtown
 with (a) R&amp;R acquiring nine million five hundred nine
thousand four hundred forty (9
509
440) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by R&amp;R of the four hundred (400) shares
of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into five million nine hundred twenty eight thousand
(5
928
000) shares of Common Stock) constituting 72% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
 and (b) Moyo acquiring
two million three hundred seventy seven thousand three hundred sixty (2
377
360) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion
by Moyo of its one hundred (100) shares of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into one million
four hundred eighty one thousand five hundred ten (1
481
510) shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in full satisfaction of our obligations under outstanding convertible promissory
notes in the principal amount of $960
000 (the &ldquo;December Notes&rdquo;)
 the Note holders of the December Notes converted
an aggregate of $479
811 of principal and accrued interest into 274
200 shares of Common Stock and accepted a cash payment from
us in the aggregate amount of $625
030 for the remaining principal balance.



    
    


On
the Effective Date: (i) Arnold P. Kling was appointed to our Board of Directors (&ldquo;Board&rdquo;) and served together with
Vincent J. McGill
 a then current director who continued to serve until August 20
 2007
 the effective date of his resignation
from our Board; (ii) all of our then officers and directors
 with the exception of Mr. McGill
 resigned from their respective
positions with us; (iii) our Board appointed Mr. Kling as president and Kirk M. Warshaw as chief financial officer and secretary;
and (iv) we relocated our headquarters to Chatham
 New Jersey.

Following
Mr. McGill&rsquo;s resignation from our Board on August 20
 2007
 Mr. Kling became our sole director and president.

On
October 19
 2007
 we effected an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100
000
000 the number of authorized
shares of Common Stock available for issuance (the &ldquo;Charter Amendment&rdquo;). As a result of the Charter Amendment
 as
of October 19
 2007
 we had adequate shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon the conversion of all the issued and outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

On
December 19
 2007
 the holders of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of
their shares into shares of Common Stock. As a result
 the 500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for
7
407
540 shares of Common Stock
 and all 500 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized
and unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock
 par value $.001 per shares. None of the Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding
as of the Series A Preferred Elimination Date.

In
December 2008
 we sold 550
000 shares of restricted Common Stock to our Chief Financial Officer
 for $2
000. The issuance of these
shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Sections 4(2) and 4(6) or the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;).
The stock certificate representing these shares was imprinted with a legend restricting transfer unless pursuant to an effective
registration statement or an exemption from registration under the Act.

On
May 6
 2013
 Ironbound Partners Fund
 LLC (&ldquo;Ironbound&rdquo;) acquired 9
509
440 shares of our outstanding Common Stock
(the &ldquo;Acquired Shares&rdquo;) for an aggregate purchase price of $15
000
 or $0.00157737 per share
 from the Chapter 7 Trustee
of the Estates of Rodman &amp; Renshaw
 LLC (&ldquo;Rodman&rdquo;)
 Direct Markets
 Inc.
 and Direct Markets Holdings
 Corp. in
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases No.
13-10087
 13-10088 and 13-10089). The Acquired Shares constituted all the shares of Common Stock previously owned by R&amp;R
an affiliate of Rodman
 and represented 69.1% of our total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of May 6
 2013.

On
May 14
 2013
 Ironbound loaned $100
000 to us and we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $100
000
to Ironbound (the &ldquo;May 2013 Note&rdquo;). The May 2013 Note was initially issued with a two-year term and bore interest
at the rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note was convertible into
shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the
&ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note was amended in July 2014 in accordance with
the Amended and Restated Note
 as described below.

On
July 25
 2014
 we raised gross proceeds of $72
000 in a debt financing transaction with Ironbound and
 in connection therewith
issued to Ironbound a convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;2014 Note&rdquo;) in the principal amount of $72
000. The 2014 Note
has a maturity date of August 31
 2015 and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and
accrued interest on the 2014 Note is convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our Common Stock following the
consummation of a &ldquo;Qualified Financing&rdquo; (as defined in the 2014 Note)
 or upon the consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental
Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the 2014 Note) at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the 2014 Note).



    
    


Further
on July 25
 2014
 we issued an amended and restated convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;Amended and Restated Note&rdquo; and
together with the 2014 Note
 the &ldquo;Prior Notes&rdquo;) to Ironbound in the principal amount of $100
000
 in substitution
for the May 2013 Note. The Amended and Restated Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August 31
 2015 and provided
for the principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note to be convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our
Common Stock following the consummation of a &ldquo;Qualified Financing&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note)
 or upon the
consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note otherwise remained unchanged.

Effective
September 1
 2015
 the maturity dates of the Prior Notes was extended from August 31
 2015 to August 31
 2016.

On
October 30
 2015
 Mr. Kling resigned from his position as our sole director and from his position as our President. Also on October
30
 2015
 Mr. Warshaw resigned from his positions as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Kling&rsquo;s and Warshaw&rsquo;s
resignation were not due to any disagreement with the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company&rsquo;s
operations
 policies or practices. Prior to Mr. Kling&rsquo;s resignation
 our Board of Directors appointed Jonathan J. Ledecky
the managing member of Ironbound
 our largest stockholder
 to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Kling&rsquo;s resignation and will
assume the role of President of the Company.

On
December 31
 2015
 Ironbound advanced to us an additional $10
000. This amount was subsequently evidenced by a promissory note
(the &ldquo;December 2015 Note&rdquo;) with the same terms as the Prior Notes. The proceeds of the December 2015 Note was utilized
by the Company to fund working capital needs.

On
April 1
 2016
 we issued a convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;April 2016 Note&rdquo;) in the principal amount of $10
000
to Ironbound. The April 2016 Note has the same terms as the Prior Notes. The proceeds of the April 2016 Note was utilized by the
Company to fund working capital needs.

On
July 15
 2016
 we issued a convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;July 2016 Note&rdquo;) in the principal amount of $25
000 to
Ironbound. The July 2016 Note has a maturity date of August 31
 2017 and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable
at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the July 2016 Note is convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares
of the Company&rsquo;s common stock following the consummation of a &ldquo;Qualified Financing&rdquo; (as defined in the July
2016 Note)
 or upon the consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the July 2016 Note) at the &ldquo;Conversion
Price&rdquo; (as defined in the July 2016 Note). The proceeds of the July 2016 Note will be utilized by the Company to fund working
capital needs.

Effective
September 1
 2016
 the maturity dates of the outstanding promissory notes held by Ironbound was extended from August 31
 2016
to August 31
 2017.

On
February 14
 2017
 we issued a convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;February 2017 Note&rdquo; and together with the Prior Notes
the December 2015 Note
 the April 2016 Note and the July 2016 Note
 the &ldquo;Outstanding Notes&rdquo;) in the principal amount
of $50
000 to Ironbound. The February 2017 Note has a maturity date of August 31
 2017 and bears interest at the rate of 5.0%
per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the February 2017 Note is convertible
 at the election of
Ironbound
 into shares of our common stock following the consummation of a &ldquo;Qualified Financing&rdquo; (as defined in the
February 2017 Note)
 or upon the consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the February 2017 Note)
at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the February 2017 Note). The proceeds of the February 2017 Note will be utilized
by the Company to fund working capital needs.

Effective
September 1
 2017
 the maturity dates of the Outstanding Notes was extended from August 31
 2017 to August 31
 2018.

THE
COMPANY TODAY

Since
the Effective Date
 our main purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered
a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; company in as much as we are not generating revenues
 do not own an operating business
 and have no specific
plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. Our
principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through
a combination with an operating company or business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific
business
 industry or geographical location and
 thus
 may acquire any type of business. The analysis of new business opportunities
will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our officers and directors. We have no employees and no material assets.



    
    


We
currently have no agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances
that we will find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent
upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any
sales of equity securities or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business
combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may
 under certain circumstances
seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business
 unless additional financing is obtained
 we will not
have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations.

A
common reason for a target company to enter into a merger with a shell company is the desire to establish a public trading market
for its shares. Such a company would hope to avoid the perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself
such as the time delays and significant expenses incurred to comply with the various federal and state securities law that regulate
initial public offerings.

As
a result of our limited resources
 unless and until additional financing is obtained we expect to have sufficient proceeds to
effect only a single business combination. Accordingly
 the prospects for our success will likely be dependent upon the future
performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several business combinations
or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry
 we do not expect to have the resources
to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. A target business may be
dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products
 processes or services
 in which
case there will be an even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be commercially viable.

We
do not expect our present management to play any managerial role for us following a business combination. Although we intend to
scrutinize closely the management of a prospective target business in connection with our evaluation of a business combination
with a target business
 our assessment of management may be incorrect.

In
evaluating a prospective target business
 we expect to consider several factors
 including the following:



    
experience and skill
    of management and availability of additional personnel of the target business;




    
costs associated
    with effecting the business combination;




    
equity interest
    retained by our stockholders in the merged entity;




    
growth potential
    of the target business;




    
capital requirements
    of the target business;




    
capital available
    to the target business;




    
stage of development
    of the target business;




    
proprietary features
    and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the target business;




    
the financial statements
    of the target business; and




    
the regulatory environment
    in which the target business operates.




    
    


The
foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular target business
will be based
 to the extent relevant
 on the above factors
 as well as other considerations we deem relevant. In connection with
our evaluation of a prospective target business
 we anticipate that we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass
among other things
 meeting with incumbent management as well as a review of financial
 legal and other information.

The
time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business (including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure
and consummate the business combination (including negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents
for filing pursuant to applicable corporate and securities laws) cannot be determined at this time. Our president intends to devote
only a very small portion of his time to our affairs
 and
 accordingly
 the consummation of a business combination may require
a longer time than if he devoted his full time to our affairs. However
 he will devote such time as he deems reasonably necessary
to carry out our business and affairs. The amount of time devoted to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending
upon
 among other things
 whether we have identified a target business or are engaged in active negotiation of a business combination.
We expect to use outside consultants
 advisors
 attorneys and accountants as necessary. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time
employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities.

We
anticipate that various prospective target businesses will be brought to our attention from various sources
 including securities
broker-dealers
 investment bankers
 venture capitalists
 bankers and other members of the financial community
 including
 possibly
the executive officers and our affiliates.

As
a general rule
 federal and state tax laws and regulations have a significant impact upon the structuring of business combinations.
We will evaluate the possible tax consequences of any prospective business combination and will endeavor to structure a business
combination so as to achieve the most favorable tax treatment to our company
 the target business and our respective stockholders.
There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or relevant state tax authorities will ultimately assent to our tax
treatment of a particular consummated business combination. To the extent the Internal Revenue Service or any relevant state tax
authorities ultimately prevail in recharacterizing the tax treatment of a business combination
 there may be adverse tax consequences
to our company
 the target business
 and our respective stockholders.

We
may acquire a company or business by purchasing the securities of such company or business. However
 we do not intend to engage
primarily in such activities. Specifically
 we intend to conduct our activities so as to avoid being classified as an &ldquo;investment
company&rdquo; under the Investment Company Act of 1940
 as amended (the &ldquo;Investment Act&rdquo;) and therefore avoid application
of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.

Section
3(a) of the Investment Company Act excepts from the definition of an &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; an entity which does not engage
primarily in the business of investing
 reinvesting or trading in securities
 or which does not engage in the business of investing
owning
 holding or trading &ldquo;investment securities&rdquo; (defined as &ldquo;all securities other than government securities
or securities of majority-owned subsidiaries&rdquo;) the value of which exceed 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding
government securities
 cash or cash items). We intend to operate any business in the future in a manner which will result in the
availability of this exception from the definition of an investment company. Consequently
 our acquisition of a company or business
through the purchase and sale of investment securities will be limited. Although we intend to act to avoid classification as an
investment company
 the provisions of the Investment Company Act are extremely complex and it is possible that we may be classified
as an inadvertent investment company. We intend to vigorously resist classification as an investment company
 and to take advantage
of any exemptions or exceptions from application of the Investment Company Act
 which allows an entity a one-time option during
any three-year period to claim an exemption as a &ldquo;transient&rdquo; investment company. The necessity of asserting any such
resistance
 or making any claim of exemption
 could be time consuming and costly
 or even prohibitive
 given our limited resources.

Various
impediments to a business combination may arise
 such as appraisal rights afforded the stockholders of a target business under
the laws of its state of organization. This may prove to be deterrent to a particular combination.



    
    




    
    


IN
ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS REPORT
 YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN EVALUATING OUR
BUSINESS
 OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US
 THAT WE CURRENTLY
DEEM IMMATERIAL OR THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FACED BY OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY OR BUSINESS IN GENERAL
 SUCH AS COMPETITIVE
CONDITIONS
 MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE
HAVE NO RECENT OPERATING HISTORY OR BASIS FOR EVALUATING PROSPECTS.

Since
the Effective Date
 we have no operating business or plans to develop one. We are currently seeking to enter into a merger or
business combination with another company. To date
 our efforts have been limited to meeting our regulatory filing requirements
and searching for a merger target.

CERTAIN
CONDITIONS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN

Since
inception
 we have incurred negative cash flow from operating activities and an accumulated deficit of $2
383
436 through March
31
 2018. For the years ended March 31
 2018 and 2017
 we had net losses of $55
851 and $60
828
 respectively. We have spent
and subject to obtaining additional financing
 expect to continue to spend
 substantial amounts in connection with executing our
business strategy. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

WE
HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND NO REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS
 AND WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN ORDER TO EXECUTE ANY BUSINESS PLAN
AND HISTORICALLY RELIED UPON FUNDING FROM OUR MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER.

We
have limited resources
 no revenues from operations to date and our cash on hand may not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements
during the next twelve months. In addition
 we will not achieve any revenues (other than insignificant investment income) until
at the earliest
 the consummation of a merger and we cannot ascertain our capital requirements until such time. Further limiting
our abilities to achieve revenues
 in order to avoid status as an &ldquo;Investment Company&rdquo; under the Investment Company
Act
 we can only invest our funds prior to a merger in limited investments which do not invoke Investment Company status. There
can be no assurance that determinations ultimately made by us will permit us to achieve our business objectives.

We
have historically relied upon funding through capital contributions from our former majority stockholder
 R&amp;R
 an affiliate
of Rodman.&nbsp; On January 11
 2013
 Rodman filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.&nbsp; As a result
 we do not expect any further
funding from R&amp;R.&nbsp; Subsequent to our fiscal year ended March 31
 2013
 on May 6
 2013
 Ironbound acquired the 9
509
440
shares of Common Stock then owned by R&amp;R from the Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estates of Rodman
 Direct Markets
 Inc.
 and Direct
Markets Holdings
 Corp. in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District
of New York (Cases No. 13-10087
 13-10088 and 13-10089). Since May 14
 2013 we have borrowed $267
000 from Ironbound and issued
the aforementioned Outstanding Notes
 July 2016 Note and February 2017 Note to it. As of March 31
 2018
 we have $3
257 on hand.
Such funds will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months and we will require additional
funds. We cannot provide assurance that adequate additional funds will be available or
 if available
 will be offered on acceptable
terms. Failure to receive adequate additional funding will cause us to cease operations.

WE
WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECT AT MOST ONE MERGER
 AND THUS MAY NOT HAVE A DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS.

Our
resources are limited and we will most likely have the ability to effect only a single merger. This probable lack of diversification
will subject us to numerous economic
 competitive and regulatory developments
 any or all of which may have a material adverse
impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to the consummation of a merger. We will become dependent
upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products
 processes or services.



    
    


WE
DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY UPON OUR PRESIDENT tO MAKE ALL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.

Our
ability to effect a merger will be dependent upon the efforts of our president
 Jonathan J. Ledecky. Notwithstanding the importance
of Mr. Ledecky
 we have not entered into any employment agreement or other understanding with Mr. Ledecky concerning compensation
or obtained any &ldquo;key man&rdquo; life insurance on any of his life. The loss of the services of Mr. Ledecky will have a material
adverse effect on our business objectives and success. We rely upon the expertise of Mr. Ledecky and do not anticipate that we
will hire additional personnel.

THERE
MAY BE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN OUR MANAGEMENT AND OUR NON-MANAGEMENT STOCKHOLDERS.

Conflicts
of interest create the risk that management may have an incentive to act adversely to the interests of other investors. An officer
may be entitled to receive compensation from a target company he or she identifies or provides services to in connection with
a business combination. A conflict of interest may arise between our management&rsquo;s personal pecuniary interest and their
fiduciary duty to our stockholders. Further
 our management&rsquo;s own pecuniary interest may at some point compromise their
fiduciary duty to our stockholders. In addition
 Mr. Ledecky
 our president and sole director
 is currently involved with other
companies and conflicts in the pursuit of business combinations with such other companies with which he and affiliates of our
majority stockholder are
 and may in the future be affiliated with
 may arise. We cannot assure you that conflicts of interest
among us
 our management and our stockholders will not develop or be resolved in our favor.

THERE
IS COMPETITION FOR THOSE PRIVATE COMPANIES SUITABLE FOR A MERGER TRANSACTION OF THE TYPE CONTEMPLATED BY MANAGEMENT.

We
are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating
a successful business combination. We are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers
with
 joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed
entities
 including small public companies and venture capital firms
 are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that
may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources
 technical
expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently
 we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible
business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood
of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.

FUTURE
SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF MANAGEMENT TO LOCATE AND ATTRACT A SUITABLE ACQUISITION.

The
nature of our operations is highly speculative. The success of our plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations
financial condition and management of the identified business opportunity. While management intends to seek business combination(s)
with entities having established operating histories
 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating candidates meeting
that criterion. In the event we complete a business combination
 the success of our operations may be dependent upon management
of the successor firm or venture partner firm and numerous other factors beyond our control.

WE
HAVE NO AGREEMENT FOR A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR OTHER TRANSACTION.

We
have no agreement with respect to engaging in a merger with
 joint venture with or acquisition of
 a private or public entity.
No assurances can be given that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will conclude
a business combination. Management has not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation.
We cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a business combination on favorable terms
 and there is consequently a risk
that funds allocated to the purchase of our shares will not be invested in a company with active business operations.



    
    


MANAGEMENT
WILL CHANGE UPON THE CONSUMMATION OF A MERGER.

After
the closing of a merger or business combination
 it is likely our current management will not retain any control or managerial
responsibilities. Upon such event
 Mr. Ledecky intends to resign from his positions with us.

CURRENT
STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY AND SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED UPON A MERGER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION.

Our
Certificate of Incorporation authorized the issuance of 100
000
000 shares of our Common Stock. There are currently 86
242
450
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock available for issuance. To the extent that additional shares of Common Stock are
authorized and issued in connection with a merger or business combination
 our stockholders could experience significant dilution
of their respective ownership interests. Furthermore
 the issuance of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock may adversely
affect prevailing market prices
 if any
 for our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through
the sale of equity securities.

CONTROL
BY EXISTING STOCKHOLDER.

As
of March 31
 2018
 Ironbound beneficially owned approximately 69% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. As a result
Ironbound is able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval
 including the election of directors
 and the
approval of mergers
 consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.

WE
OR ANY BUSINESS WE SEEK TO ACQUIRE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY RISKS.

We
or any company we seek to acquire may rely on information technology systems
 including third-party hosted servers and cloud-based
servers
 to keep business
 financial
 and corporate records
 communicate internally and externally
 and operate other critical
functions. If any of those internal systems or the systems of its third-party providers are compromised due to cyber incidents
then sensitive documents could be exposed or deleted
 and our ability to conduct business could be impaired. Cyber incidents can
result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include
 but are not limited to
 unauthorized access
to systems
 computer viruses or other malicious code
 denial of service attacks
 malware
 ransomware
 phishing
 SQL injection
attacks
 human error
 or other events that result in security breaches or give rise to the manipulation or loss of sensitive information
or assets. Cyber incidents can be caused by various persons or groups
 including disgruntled employees and vendors
 activists
organized crime groups
 and state-sponsored and individual hackers. Cyber incidents can also be caused or aggravated by natural
events
 such as earthquakes
 floods
 fires
 power loss
 and telecommunications failures. In addition to operational and business
consequences
 if a target business&rsquo; cybersecurity is breached
 it could be held liable to its customers or other parties
in regulatory or other actions
 and it may be exposed to reputation damages and loss of trust and business. This could result
in costly investigations and litigation
 civil or criminal penalties
 fines
 and negative publicity. Any of the foregoing could
have a material adverse effect.

OUR
COMMON STOCK IS A &ldquo;PENNY STOCK&rdquo; WHICH MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE SECONDARY
MARKET.

The
Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) has adopted regulations which generally define &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; to be an equity security that has a market price
 as defined
 of less than $5.00 per share
 or an exercise price of less than
$5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions
 including an exception of an equity security that is quoted on a national securities
exchange. Our Common Stock is not now quoted on a national securities exchange and has a market price of less than $5.00 per share
and therefore may be deemed to be a penny stock. As such
 they are subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements
on broker-dealers who sell these securities. For example
 the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for
the purchaser of such securities and have received the purchaser&rsquo;s written consent to the transactions prior to the purchase.
Additionally
 the rules require the delivery
 prior to the transaction
 of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating
to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered
underwriter
 and current quotations for the securities
 and
 if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker
 the broker-dealer
must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer&rsquo;s presumed control over the market. Finally
 among other requirements
 monthly statements
must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. The &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules
 may restrict the ability of our stockholders to sell our Common Stock and
warrants in the secondary market.



    
    


OUR
COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN THINLY TRADED
 LIQUIDITY IS LIMITED
 AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON A MORE
LIQUID MARKET.

Our
Common Stock has been thinly traded and is currently quoted on the OTC Markets
 which provide significantly less liquidity than
a national securities exchange such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ. There is uncertainty that we will ever be accepted for a listing
on a national securities exchange. The purchasers of shares of our Common Stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at
prices quoted in the market or at all.

 our legal counsel
 located at 405 Lexington

 or interests in
 persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.

SELECTED FINANCIAL
    DATA.


As
a smaller reporting company
 as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange
Act&rdquo;)
 we are not required to provide the information required by this item.



    
MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.




We
are a corporation with limited operations and have very limited revenues from our business operations since our incorporation
in September 2005. Until December 31
 2007
 we held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen&rsquo;s Donut Brand in the United States
with the exception of the states of Florida and Pennsylvania
 and in Suffolk County
 New York
 which Dreesen retained for itself.
The license from Dreesen expired on December 31
 2007.

As
of the Effective Date
 we discontinued our efforts to promote the Dreesen&rsquo;s Donut Brand
 we have no employees and our main purpose
has been to effect a business combination with an operating business which we believe has significant growth potential. As of
yet
 we have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no
assurances that we will find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly
contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any
offering
 any sales of equity securities or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect
a business combination with a target business which we believe has significant growth potential. While we may
 under certain circumstances
seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business
 unless and until additional financing is obtained
 we
will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations.

A
common reason for a target company to enter into a merger with us is the desire to establish a public trading market for its shares.
Such a company would hope to avoid the perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself
 such as the time
delays and significant expenses incurred to comply with the various Federal and state securities law that regulate initial public
offerings.



    
    


As
a result of our limited resources
 we expect to effect only a single business combination. Accordingly
 the prospects for our
success will likely be dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities that have the resources
to consummate several business combinations or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry
we do not expect the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses.
A target business may be dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products
 processes
or services
 in which case there will be an even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be commercially viable.

Our
officers are only required to devote a small portion of their time (less than 10%) to our affairs on a part-time or as-needed
basis. We expect to use outside consultants
 advisors
 attorneys and accountants as necessary. We do not anticipate hiring any
full-time employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities.

We
expect our present management to play no managerial role in our company following a business combination. Although we intend to
scrutinize closely the management of a prospective target business in connection with our evaluation of a business combination
with a target business
 our assessment of management may be incorrect. We cannot assure you that we will find a suitable business
with which to combine.

Our
principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through
a combination with an operating business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business
industry or geographical location and
 thus
 may acquire any type of business. The analysis of new business opportunities will
be undertaken by or under the supervision of our officers and directors.

EQUIPMENT
AND EMPLOYEES

As
of March 31
 2018
 we had no operating business
 no equipment
 and no employees. We do not intend to develop our own operating
business but instead plan to consummate a business combination transaction with an operating company.

Results
of Operations

Continuing
Operating Expenses for the Fiscal Year Ended&nbsp;March 31
 2018&nbsp;Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended&nbsp;March 31
&nbsp;2017

We
are a corporation with limited operations and did not have any operating revenues during the fiscal years ended March 31
 2018
and 2017
 respectively.

Total
expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31
 2018 and 2017 were $55
851 and $60
828
 respectively. The majority of these expenses
primarily constituted general and administrative expenses related to accounting and compliance with the Exchange Act.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

At
March 31
 2018
 we did not have any revenues from operations. Our principal source of operating capital recently has been provided
in the form of loans and capital contributions from our stockholders. Absent a merger or other combination with an operating company
we do not expect to have any revenues from operations. No assurance can be given that such a merger or other combination will
occur or that we can engage in any public or private sales of our equity or debt securities to raise working capital. We are dependent
upon future loans or capital contributions from our present stockholders and/or management and there can be no assurances that
our present stockholders or management will make any loans or capital contributions to us.

At
March 31
 2018
 we had the Outstanding Notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of $267
000 payable to Ironbound
 our majority
stockholder. We had cash and cash equivalents of $3
257 and negative working capital of $308
922. Such funds will not be sufficient
to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months and we will require additional funds. We cannot provide assurance
that adequate additional funds will be available or
 if available
 will be offered on acceptable terms.



    
    


Our
present material commitments are professional and administrative fees and expenses associated with the preparation of our filings
with the SEC and other regulatory requirements. In the event that we engage in any merger or other combination with an operating
company
 it is likely that we will have additional material commitments.



We
do not have any commitments which are required to be disclosed in tabular form as of March 31
 2018.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

As
of March 31
 2018
 we have no off-balance sheet arrangements such as guarantees
 retained or contingent interest in assets transferred
obligation under a derivative instrument and obligation arising out of or a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.

Critical
Accounting Policies

Our
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Note 2 to the financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial
statements.

We
have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our financial position
and results of operations.&nbsp; These policies may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity in their application and
represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. Although we believe our judgments
and estimates are appropriate and correct
 actual future results may differ from estimates. If different assumptions or conditions
were to prevail
 the results could be materially different from these reported results. The impact and any associated risks related
to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this Report where such policies affect our reported and
expected financial results.

The
preparation of our financial statements
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
 requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
These estimates have a material impact on our financial statements and are discussed in detail throughout this Report.

As
part of the process of preparing our financial statements
 we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions
in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences
resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and
liabilities
 which are included within the balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will
be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely
 we must establish a valuation
allowance. In the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the
net recorded amount
 an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination
was made.

We
account for our stock option grants under the provisions of the accounting guidance for Share-Based Payments. Such guidance requires
the recognition of the fair value of share-based compensation in the statements of operations. The fair value of our stock option
awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions
and elections in adopting and implementing this guidance
 including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of
each award. The fair value of share-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use
the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of this guidance.

CHANGES IN AND
    DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.






    
CONTROLS AND
    PROCEDURES.


(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our
management
 with the participation of our president and chief financial officer
 carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our &ldquo;disclosure controls and procedures&rdquo; (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of
the end of the period covered by this Report (the &ldquo;Evaluation Date&rdquo;). Based upon that evaluation
 the president and
chief financial officer concluded that as of the Evaluation Date
 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective&nbsp;to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded
processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated
and communicated to our management
 including our&nbsp;president&nbsp;and chief financial officer
 as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our
management
 including our president and chief financial officer
 does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or
our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can
provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 management&rsquo;s evaluation of controls and procedures can only
provide reasonable assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within Newtown Lane have been detected.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of March 31
 2018. In making this assessment
 our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 which was adopted by COSO in 1992. Our management
has concluded that
 as of March 31
 2018
 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during&nbsp;the last fiscal quarter covered by
this Report&nbsp;that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial
reporting.

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent
of our Common Stock (collectively
 the &ldquo;Reporting Persons&rdquo;) to report their ownership of and transactions in our Common
Stock to the SEC. Copies of these reports are also required to be supplied to us. To our knowledge
 during the fiscal year ended

 2018 the Reporting Persons complied with all applicable Section 16(a) reporting requirements.

Code
of Ethics

We
have not adopted a Code of Ethics given our limited operations. We expect that following a merger or other acquisition transaction
our Board will adopt a Code of Ethics.

Nominating
Compensation and Audit Committees

As
we only have one Board member and given our limited operations
 we do not have separate or independent nominating
 audit or compensation
committees. Our Board has determined that it does not have an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert
&rdquo; as that term is defined
in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. In addition
 we have not adopted any procedures by which our stockholders may recommend nominees
to our Board.



ITEM
    11.
EXECUTIVE
    COMPENSATION.


Mr.
Ledecky is our sole officer and director. Mr. Ledecky has not received any compensation during the fiscal years ended March 31
2018 and 2017.

While
we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that specialize in finding business acquisitions on
any formal basis
 we may engage such firms in the future
 in which event we may be required to pay a finder&rsquo;s fee or other compensation.
In no event
 however
 will we pay a finder&rsquo;s fee or commission to any of our officers and directors or any entity with which an
officer or director is affiliated. We do not have any incentive or stock option plan in effect.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




 Inc.





of Newtown Lane Marketing

 2018 and 2017
 the related statements of operations
shareholders&rsquo; deficit
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &quot;financial
statements&quot;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of
the Company as of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The Company&rsquo;s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern

The accompanying
.&nbsp;&nbsp;As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements
 the Company has incurred recurring losses and will have to obtain additional capital
.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management&rsquo;s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.




of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&quot;PCAOB&quot;)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
we express no such opinion in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.


assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.&nbsp;

 INCORPORATED


 2018 and 2017




 Incorporated&nbsp;(&ldquo;we&rdquo;
&ldquo;our&rdquo;
 &ldquo;us&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;Newtown&rdquo;) was incorporated in Delaware on September 26
 2005. We previously
held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen&rsquo;s Donut Brand in the United States with the exception of the states of Florida
and Pennsylvania
 and in Suffolk County
 New York
 which Dreesen retained for itself. In August 2007 there was a change in control
as detailed below
 and we discontinued our efforts to promote the Dreesen&rsquo;s Donut Brand at that time. The license from Dreesen
expired on December 31
 2007.




 2007 (the &ldquo;Effective
Date&rdquo;)
 we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;Purchase Agreement&rdquo;) with Moyo Partners
 LLC
 a New
York limited liability company (&ldquo;Moyo&rdquo;) and R&amp;R Biotech Partners
 LLC
 a Delaware limited liability company (&ldquo;R&amp;R&rdquo;
collectively with Moyo
 the &ldquo;Purchasers&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which we sold to them
 in the aggregate
 approximately
 four
million four hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4

 our main purpose
has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; company in
as much as we are not generating revenues
 do not own an operating business
 and have no specific plan other than to engage in
a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. Our principal business objective
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating
company or business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business
 industry or geographical
location and
 thus
 may acquire any type of business. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under
the supervision of our officers and directors. We have no employees and no material assets.


POLICIES

considered particularly significant.





have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 which contemplates
Newtown continuing as a going concern. Our purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently
considered a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues
 we do own an operating business
 and have
no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be-identified operating company or business.
We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there no
assurances that we find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent
upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any
sales of equity securities or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business
combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may
 under certain circumstances
seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business
 unless additional financing is obtained
 we will not have
sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations. There is no
assurance that these plans will be realized in whole or in part. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of these uncertainties.


    
    



 Newtown has
incurred an accumulated deficit of $2
383
436 through March 31
 2018. For the years ended March 31
 2018 and 2017
 Newtown had
net losses of $55
851 and $60
828
 respectively. Newtown has incurred negative cash flow from operating activities since its inception.
Newtown has spent
 and subject to obtaining additional funding
 expects to continue to spend substantial amounts in connection
with executing its business strategy. These conditions raise substantial doubt about Newtown&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going
concern.





with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 management makes certain estimates and assumptions
where applicable
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements
 as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
While actual results could differ from those estimates
 management does not expect such variances
 if any
 to have a material effect
on the financial statements.





of cash flows Newtown considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.





Board (FASB) has issued accounting guidance &ldquo;Earnings Per Share&rdquo; that provides for the calculation of &ldquo;Basic&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Diluted&rdquo; earnings per share. Basic earnings per share include no dilution and is computed by dividing the loss
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. All potentially dilutive securities
have been excluded from the computations since they would be antidilutive. However
 these dilutive securities could potentially
dilute earnings per share in the future. As of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 we had a total of 886
990 of potentially dilutive securities

 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations
in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax
assets unless it is  more likely than not that such assets will be realized.

awards.


    
    



 the
fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain
assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating
the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management&rsquo;s bet estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the
application of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and we use different assumptions
 our stock-based compensation
expense could be materially different in the future. In addition
 we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and
only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating our forfeiture rate
 we analyzed our historical forfeiture
rate
 the remaining lives of unvested options
 and the amount of vested option as a percentage of total options outstanding. If
our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate

 Newtown had approximately
$1
960
000 of net operating loss carry forwards (&ldquo;NOL&rsquo;s&rdquo;) available which expires in various years beginning
in 2030. In addition
 there is a $25
000 capital loss carryover
 which is fully reserved as well. This capital loss expires in
2026. The deferred tax asset and related valuation did not increase during the year ended March 31
 2018. The utilization of the
net operating loss carryforward has been limited as to its use pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to the recent
and past changes in ownership of Newtown. The benefits of these NOL&rsquo;s may be reduced in the future if Newtown is successful
in establishing a new business. Newtown&rsquo;s federal and state income tax returns for the years 2013 through 2018 remain open
for audit by applicable regulatory authority.

 &amp;#8220;our&amp;#8221;
 &amp;#8220;us&amp;#8221; or&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;Newtown&amp;#8221;) was incorporated&#13;in Delaware on September 26
 2005. We previously held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen&amp;#8217;s Donut Brand in the&#13;United States with the exception of the states of Florida and Pennsylvania
 and in Suffolk County
 New York
 which Dreesen retained&#13;for itself. In August 2007 there was a change in control
 as detailed below
 and we discontinued our efforts to promote the Dreesen&amp;#8217;s&#13;Donut Brand at that time. The license from Dreesen expired on December 31

 2007 (the &amp;#8220;Effective Date&amp;#8221;)
 we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &amp;#8220;Purchase Agreement&amp;#8221;)&#13;with Moyo Partners
 LLC
 a New York limited liability company (&amp;#8220;Moyo&amp;#8221;) and R&amp;#38;R Biotech Partners
 LLC
 a Delaware&#13;limited liability company (&amp;#8220;R&amp;#38;R&amp;#8221; collectively with Moyo
 the &amp;#8220;Purchasers&amp;#8221;)
 pursuant to which we sold&#13;to them
 in the aggregate
 approximately
 four million four hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4
479
250) shares&#13;of our common stock
 par value $.001 per share (&amp;#8220;Common Stock&amp;#8221;) and&lt;i&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;five hundred (500&lt;i&gt;)&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;shares&lt;i&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;of&#13;our Series A Preferred Stock
 par value $.001 per share (&amp;#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&amp;#8221;)
 each share convertible at the&#13;option of the holder into
 approximately
 fourteen thousand eight hundred twenty (14
820) shares of Common Stock
 for aggregate&#13;gross&lt;i&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;proceeds to us of $600

 with (a) R&amp;#38;R acquiring nine million five hundred nine&#13;thousand four hundred forty (9
509
440) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by R&amp;#38;R of the four hundred (400) shares&#13;of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into five million nine hundred twenty eight thousand&#13;(5
928
000) shares of Common Stock) constituting 72% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
 and (b) Moyo acquiring&#13;two million three hundred seventy seven thousand three hundred sixty (2
377
360) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion&#13;by Moyo of its one hundred (100) shares of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into one million&#13;four hundred eighty one thousand five hundred ten (1
481
510) shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and&#13;outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in full satisfaction of our obligations under outstanding convertible promissory&#13;notes in the principal amount of $960
000 (the &amp;#8220;December Notes&amp;#8221;)
 the Note holders of the December Notes converted&#13;an aggregate of $479
811 of principal and accrued interest into 274
200 shares of Common Stock and accepted a cash payment from&#13;us in the aggregate amount of $625

 a then current director who continued to serve until August 20
 2007
 the effective date of his resignation&#13;from our Board; (ii) all of our then officers and directors
 with the exception of Mr. McGill
 resigned from their respective&#13;positions with us; (iii) our Board appointed Mr. Kling as president and Kirk M. Warshaw as chief financial officer and secretary;&#13;and (iv) we relocated our headquarters to Chatham

 2007

 2007
 we effected an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100
000
000 the number of authorized&#13;shares of Common Stock available for issuance (the &amp;#8220;Charter Amendment&amp;#8221;). As a result of the Charter Amendment
 as&#13;of October 19
 2007

 2007
 the holders of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of&#13;their shares into shares of Common Stock. As a result
 the 500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for&#13;7
407
540 shares of Common Stock
 and all 500 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized&#13;and unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock

 we sold 550
000 shares of restricted Common Stock to our Chief Financial Officer
 for $2
000. The issuance of these&#13;shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Sections 4(2) and 4(6) or the Securities Act of 1933

 2013
 Ironbound Partners Fund
 LLC (&amp;#8220;Ironbound&amp;#8221;) acquired 9
509
440 shares of our outstanding Common Stock&#13;(the &amp;#8220;Acquired Shares&amp;#8221;) for an aggregate purchase price of $15
000
 or $0.00157737 per share
 from the Chapter 7 Trustee&#13;of the Estates of Rodman &amp;#38; Renshaw
 LLC (&amp;#8220;Rodman&amp;#8221;)
 Direct Markets
 Inc.
 and Direct Markets Holdings
 Corp. in&#13;Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases No.&#13;13-10087
 13-10088 and 13-10089). The Acquired Shares constituted all the shares of Common Stock previously owned by R&amp;#38;R

Organization

NOTE
1 &#8211; DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY

Newtown
Lane Marketing
 Incorporated&#160;(&#8220;we&#8221;
 &#8220;our&#8221;
 &#8220;us&#8221; or&#160;&#8220;Newtown&#8221;) was incorporated
in Delaware on September 26
 2005. We previously held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen&#8217;s Donut Brand in the
United States with the exception of the states of Florida and Pennsylvania
 and in Suffolk County
 New York
 which Dreesen retained
for itself. In August 2007 there was a change in control
 as detailed below
 and we discontinued our efforts to promote the Dreesen&#8217;s
Donut Brand at that time. The license from Dreesen expired on December 31
 2007.

EQUITY
TRANSACTIONS

On
August 8
 2007 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;)
 we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;)
with Moyo Partners
 LLC
 a New York limited liability company (&#8220;Moyo&#8221;) and R&#38;R Biotech Partners
 LLC
 a Delaware
limited liability company (&#8220;R&#38;R&#8221; collectively with Moyo
 the &#8220;Purchasers&#8221;)
 pursuant to which we sold
to them
 in the aggregate
 approximately
 four million four hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4
479
250) shares
of our common stock
of
our Series A Preferred Stock
 par value $.001 per share (&#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;)
 each share convertible at the
option of the holder into
 approximately
 fourteen thousand eight hundred twenty (14
820) shares of Common Stock
 for aggregate
proceeds to us of $600
000. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible only to the extent there
were a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon any such conversion.

On
the Effective Date: (i) the Purchasers acquired control of Newtown
 with (a) R&#38;R acquiring nine million five hundred nine
thousand four hundred forty (9
509
440) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by R&#38;R of the four hundred (400) shares
of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into five million nine hundred twenty eight thousand
(5
928
000) shares of Common Stock) constituting 72% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
 and (b) Moyo acquiring
two million three hundred seventy seven thousand three hundred sixty (2
377
360) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion
by Moyo of its one hundred (100) shares of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into one million
four hundred eighty one thousand five hundred ten (1
481
510) shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in full satisfaction of our obligations under outstanding convertible promissory
notes in the principal amount of $960
000 (the &#8220;December Notes&#8221;)
 the Note holders of the December Notes converted
an aggregate of $479
811 of principal and accrued interest into 274
200 shares of Common Stock and accepted a cash payment from
us in the aggregate amount of $625
030 for the remaining principal balance.

On
the Effective Date: (i) Arnold P. Kling was appointed to our Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;) and served together with
Vincent J. McGill
 a then current director who continued to serve until August 20
 2007
 the effective date of his resignation
from our Board; (ii) all of our then officers and directors
 with the exception of Mr. McGill
 resigned from their respective
positions with us; (iii) our Board appointed Mr. Kling as president and Kirk M. Warshaw as chief financial officer and secretary;
and (iv) we relocated our headquarters to Chatham
 New Jersey.

Following
Mr. McGill&#8217;s resignation from our Board on August 20
 2007
 Mr. Kling became our sole director and president.

On
October 19
 2007
 we effected an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100
000
000 the number of authorized
shares of Common Stock available for issuance (the &#8220;Charter Amendment&#8221;). As a result of the Charter Amendment
 as
of October 19
 2007
 we had adequate shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon the conversion of all the issued and outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock.&#160;

On
December 19
 2007
 the holders of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of
their shares into shares of Common Stock. As a result
 the 500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for
7
407
540 shares of Common Stock
 and all 500 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized
and unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock
 par value $.001 per shares. None of the Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding
as of the Series A Preferred Elimination Date.

In
December 2008
 we sold 550
000 shares of restricted Common Stock to our Chief Financial Officer
 for $2
000. The issuance of these
shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Sections 4(2) and 4(6) or the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &#8220;Act&#8221;).
The stock certificate representing these shares was imprinted with a legend restricting transfer unless pursuant to an effective
registration statement or an exemption from registration under the Act.

On
May 6
 2013
 Ironbound Partners Fund
 LLC (&#8220;Ironbound&#8221;) acquired 9
509
440 shares of our outstanding Common Stock
(the &#8220;Acquired Shares&#8221;) for an aggregate purchase price of $15
000
 or $0.00157737 per share
 from the Chapter 7 Trustee
of the Estates of Rodman &#38; Renshaw
 LLC (&#8220;Rodman&#8221;)
 Direct Markets
 Inc.
 and Direct Markets Holdings
 Corp. in
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases No.
13-10087
 13-10088 and 13-10089). The Acquired Shares constituted all the shares of Common Stock previously owned by R&#38;R
an affiliate of Rodman
 and represented 69.1% of our total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of May 6
 2013.

On
May 14
 2013
 Ironbound loaned $100
000 to us and we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $100
000
to Ironbound (the &#8220;May 2013 Note&#8221;). The May 2013 Note was initially issued with a two-year term and bore interest
at the rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note was convertible into
shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of a &#8220;Fundamental Transaction&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the
&#8220;Conversion Price&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note was amended in July 2014 in accordance with
the Amended and Restated Note
 as described below.

On
July 25
 2014
 we raised gross proceeds of $72
000 in a debt financing transaction with Ironbound and
 in connection therewith
issued to Ironbound a convertible promissory note (the &#8220;2014 Note&#8221;) in the principal amount of $72
000. The 2014 Note
has a maturity date of August 31
 2015 and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and
accrued interest on the 2014 Note is convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our Common Stock following the
consummation of a &#8220;Qualified Financing&#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note)
 or upon the consummation of a &#8220;Fundamental
Transaction&#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note) at the &#8220;Conversion Price&#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note).

Further
on July 25
 2014
 we issued an amended and restated convertible promissory note (the &#8220;Amended and Restated Note&#8221; and
together with the 2014 Note
 the &#8220;Prior Notes&#8221;) to Ironbound in the principal amount of $100
000
 in substitution
for the May 2013 Note. The Amended and Restated Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August 31
 2015 and provided
for the principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note to be convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our
Common Stock following the consummation of a &#8220;Qualified Financing&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note)

NOTE
2 &#8211; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Newtown&#8217;s
accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Outlined
below are those policies considered particularly significant.



    
    
    


The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America
 which contemplates Newtown continuing as a going concern. Our purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire
an operating business and we are currently considered a &#8220;shell&#8221; company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues
we do own an operating business
 and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a
yet-to-be-identified operating company or business. We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective
business combination candidates and there no assurances that we find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation
of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend
to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any sales of equity securities or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination
of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential.
While we may
 under certain circumstances
 seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business
 unless additional
financing is obtained
 we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional
business combinations. There is no assurance that these plans will be realized in whole or in part. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.&#160;

Since
inception
 Newtown has incurred an accumulated deficit of $2
383
436 through March 31
 2018. For the years ended March 31
 2018
and 2017
 Newtown had net losses of $55
851 and $60
828
 respectively. Newtown has incurred negative cash flow from operating
activities since its inception. Newtown has spent
 and subject to obtaining additional funding
 expects to continue to spend substantial
amounts in connection with executing its business strategy. These conditions raise substantial doubt about Newtown&#8217;s ability
to continue as a going concern.



    
    
    


In
preparing financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 management makes
certain estimates and assumptions
 where applicable
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ from those estimates
 management does not expect such
variances
 if any
 to have a material effect on the financial statements.



    
    
Statement of Cash
    Flows:


For
purposes of the statements of cash flows Newtown considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.



    
    
Loss per Common
    Share:


The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued accounting guidance &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221; that provides for
the calculation of &#8220;Basic&#8221; and &#8220;Diluted&#8221; earnings per share. Basic earnings per share include no dilution
and is computed by dividing the loss to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. All potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computations since they would be antidilutive. However
these dilutive securities could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future. As of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 we had a total
of 886
990 of potentially dilutive securities comprised solely of stock options.



    
    
    


The
asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to
reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.



    
    
    


The
estimated fair values of all reported assets and liabilities which represent financial instruments
 none of which are held for
trading purposes
 approximate their carrying values because of the short term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest
rates are indicative of market interest rates.



    
    
    


We
adopted the FASB accounting guidance for share based payment transactions. This standard requires us to measure the cost of employee
services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options and applies to
all outstanding and vested stock-based awards.&#160;

In
computing the impact
 the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing
model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility and expected remaining lives of the awards. The
assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management&#8217;s bet estimates involve
inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and we use different assumptions
our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition
 we are required to estimate the
expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating our forfeiture rate
 we analyzed
our historical forfeiture rate
 the remaining lives of unvested options
 and the amount of vested option as a percentage of total
options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate
 or if we reevaluate the forfeiture
rate in the future
 the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current
period.

The
accounting guidance requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of each stock-based award. We use the Black-Scholes
model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted based on the following assumptions:


No
options were exercised in the year ended March 31
 2018 and 2017.



    
    
    


Except
as set forth below
 management does not believe that any other new accounting pronouncements not yet effective will have a material
impact on our financial statements once adopted.

In
May 2017
 FASB issued accounting standards update ASU-2017-09
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#8221; (Topic 718) &#8211;Modification
Accounting&#8221;
 to provide clarity and reduce both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the
guidance in Topic 718
 Compensation-Stock Compensation
 to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for annual periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim period for public entities for
reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued
 and all other entities for reporting periods for which
financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2017-09 on the Company&#8217;s financial statements.

NOTE
3 &#8211; STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; DEFICIT

On
May 9
 2007
 an employee and two officers transferred 500
000 shares in aggregate (approximately 166
670 shares a piece) to a
third party for services on our behalf.

On
the Effective Date
 we entered into and closed the Purchase Agreement with the Purchasers
 pursuant to which we sold to them
in the aggregate approximately
 four million four hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4
479
250) shares of our Common
Stock and five hundred (500) shares of Preferred Stock
 each share convertible at the option of the holder of approximately
 fourteen
thousand eight hundred twenty (14
820) shares of Common Stock
 for aggregate gross proceeds to us of $600
000. Preferred Stock
is convertible only to the extent there are a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon any such
conversion.

On
the Effective Date&#8221; (i) the Purchasers acquired control of Newtown
 with (a) R&#38;R acquiring nine million five hundred
nine thousand four hundred forty (9
509
440) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion of R&#38;R of the four hundred (400)
shares of Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into five million nine hundred twenty eight thousand
(5
928
000) shares of Common Stock) constituting 72% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
 and (b) Moyo acquiring
two million three hundred seventy seven thousand three hundred sixty (2
377
360) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion
by Moyo of its one hundred (100) shares of Preferred Stock it acquired to pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into one million
four hundred eighty one thousand five hundred ten (1
481
510) shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in full satisfaction of our obligations under the December Notes
 the holders of
the December Notes converted an aggregate of $479
811 of principal and accrued interest into 274
200 shares of Common Stock and
accepted a cash payment from us in the aggregate amount of $625
030 for the remaining principal balance.

On
October 19
 2007
 we put into effect an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100
000
000 the number of
authorized shares of Common Stock available for issuance (the &#8220;Charter Amendment&#8221;). As a result of the Charter Amendment
as of October 19
 2007
 we had adequate shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon the conversion of all the issued and
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

On
December 19
 2007
 the holders of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of
their shares into shares of Common Stock. As a result
 the 500 shares of series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for
7
407
540 shares of Common Stock
 and all 500 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized
and unissued shares of undersigned preferred stock
 par value $.001 per share.

On
August 29
 2008
 we implemented a 1 for 50 reverse stock split (the &#8220;Reverse Split&#8221;) of the Common Stock. Pursuant
to the Reverse Split
 each 50 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding was converted into one share of Common Stock.

In
December 2008
 we sold 550
000 shares of Common Stock to Kirk Warshaw
 CFO
 for $2
000. We determined such shares were issued
below their fair value; hence
 $11
750 of compensation expense was recorded for the difference in value of the shares issued for
cash versus fair value of such shares.

On
May 6
 2013
 Ironbound Partners Fund
 LLC (&#8220;Ironbound&#8221;) acquired 9
509
440 shares of Common Stock (the &#8220;Acquired
Shares&#8221;) for an aggregate purchase price of $15
000
 or $0.00157737 per share. The Acquired Shares represent 69.1% of our
total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Acquired Shares were purchased by Ironbound
 utilizing its available
and uncommitted cash
 from the Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estates of Rodman &#38; Renshaw
 LLC (&#8220;Rodman&#8221;)
 Direct Markets
Inc. and /Direct Markets Holding
 Corp. in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of New York (Cases No. 13-10087
 13-10088 and 13-10089). The Acquired Shares constitute all the shares of
Common Stock previously owned by R&#38;R
 an affiliate of Rodman.

On
August 15
 2013
 we declared a stock dividend on our outstanding Common Stock for stockholders of record as of August 15
 2013
(the &#8220;Record Date&#8221;). As a result
 all stockholders on the Record Date received nine new shares of Common Stock for
each share of Common Stock owned by them as of that date (the &#8220;2013 Stock Dividend&#8221;). All share and per share data
herein has been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Split and the 2013 Stock Dividend
 since the 2013 Stock Dividend
was in substance a forward stock split.

During
the years ended March 31
 2018 and March 31
 2017
 the Company recorded a $5
000 contribution to capital for the fair value relating
to the use
 occupancy and administrative services rendered by the officers.

STOCK
OPTIONS

During
the year ended March 31
 2014
 we issued 886
990 non-qualified stock options to an officer and consultant. These options have
a ten year term with exercise prices ranging from $0.002 to $0.02 per share. Some of these options immediately and other options
issued vested 50% upon issuance and the remainder vet on their six month anniversary. The options issued during the year ended
March 31
 2014 have been valued at $8
050 for which $4
389 of compensation expense was recorded during the year ended March 31
2014. The balance of the option expense
 $3
661 was recorded as expense during the year ended March 31
 2015.

NOTE
4 &#8211; NOTES PAYABLE &#8211; RELATED PARTY

On
May 14
 2013
 Ironbound loaned $100
000 to us and we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $100
000
to Ironbound (the May 2013 &#8220;Note&#8221;). The May 2013 Note was initially issued with a two-year term and bore interest
at a rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note was convertible into
shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of a &#8220;Fundamental Transaction&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the
&#8220;Conversion Price&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note was amended in July 2014 in accordance with
the amended and Restated Note
 as described below.

On
July 25
 2014
 we raised gross proceeds of $72
000 in a debt financing transaction with Ironbound and
 in connection therewith
issued to Ironbound a convertible promissory note (the &#8220;2014 Note&#8221;) in the principal amount of $72
000. The 2014 Note
has a maturity date of August 31
 2015 and bears interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and
accrued interest on the 2014 Note is convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our common stock following the
consummation of a &#8220;Qualified Financing&#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note)
 or upon the consummation of a &#8220;Fundamental
Transaction&#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note) at the &#8220;Conversion Price&#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note).

Further
on July 25
 2014
 we issued an amended and restated convertible promissory note (the &#8220;Amended and Restated Note&#8221; and
together with the 2014 Note
 the &#8220;Prior Notes&#8221;) to Ironbound in the principal amount of $100
000
 in substitution
for the May 2013 Note. The Amended and Restated Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August 31
 2015 and provided
for the principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note to be convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our
Common Stock following the consummation of a &#8220;Qualified Financing&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note)
 or upon the
consummation of a &#8220;Fundamental Transaction&#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the &#8220;Conversion Price&#8221;
(as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note otherwise remained unchanged.

Effective
September 1
 2015
 the maturity dates of the Prior Notes was extended from August 31
 2015 to August 31
 2016.

On
October 30
 2015
 Mr. Kling resigned from his position as our sole director and from his position as our President. Also on October
30
 2015
 Mr. Warshaw resigned from his positions as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Kling&#8217;s and Warshaw&#8217;s
resignation were not due to any disagreement with the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company&#8217;s
operations
 policies or practices. Prior to Mr. Kling&#8217;s resignation
 our Board of Directors appointed Jonathan J. Ledecky
the managing member of Ironbound
 our largest stockholder
 to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Kling&#8217;s resignation and will
assume the role of President of the Company.

On
April 1
 2016
 we issued a convertible promissory note (the &#8220;2016 Note&#8221; and together with the Prior Notes
 the &#8220;Outstanding
Notes&#8221;) in the principal amount of $10
000 to Ironbound. The 2016 Note has the same terms as the Prior Notes. The proceeds
of the 2016 Note was and will be utilized by the Company to fund working capital needs.

On
July 15

 including a reduction in
the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%

 Newtown had approximately $1

which expires in various years beginning in 2030. In addition
 there is a $25
000 capital loss carryover
 which is fully reserved
as well. This capital loss expires in 2026. The deferred tax asset and related valuation did not increase during the year ended
March 31
 2018. The utilization of the net operating loss carryforward has been limited as to its use pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 due to the recent and past changes in ownership of Newtown. The benefits of these NOL&#8217;s may be
reduced in the future if Newtown is successful in establishing a new business. Newtown&#8217;s federal and state income tax returns

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America
 which contemplates Newtown continuing as a going concern. Our purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire
an operating business and we are currently considered a &#8220;shell&#8221; company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues
we do own an operating business
 and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a
yet-to-be-identified operating company or business. We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective
business combination candidates and there no assurances that we find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation
of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend
to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any sales of equity securities or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination
of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential.
While we may
 under certain circumstances
 seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business
 unless additional
financing is obtained
 we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional
business combinations. There is no assurance that these plans will be realized in whole or in part. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.&#160;

Since
inception
 Newtown has incurred an accumulated deficit of $2
383
436 through March 31
 2018. For the years ended March 31
 2018
and 2017
 Newtown had net losses of $55
851 and $60
828
 respectively. Newtown has incurred negative cash flow from operating
activities since its inception. Newtown has spent
 and subject to obtaining additional funding
 expects to continue to spend substantial
amounts in connection with executing its business strategy. These conditions raise substantial doubt about Newtown&#8217;s ability
to continue as a going concern.






    
    
    


In
preparing financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 management makes
certain estimates and assumptions
 where applicable
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ from those estimates
 management does not expect such
variances
 if any
 to have a material effect on the financial statements.






    
    
    


For
purposes of the statements of cash flows Newtown considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.






    
    
    


The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued accounting guidance &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221; that provides for
the calculation of &#8220;Basic&#8221; and &#8220;Diluted&#8221; earnings per share. Basic earnings per share include no dilution
and is computed by dividing the loss to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. All potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computations since they would be antidilutive. However
these dilutive securities could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future. As of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 we had a total
of 886
990 of potentially dilutive securities comprised solely of stock options.






    
    
    


The
asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation
allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it  is more likely than not that such
assets will be realized.






    
    
    


The
estimated fair values of all reported assets and liabilities which represent financial instruments
 none of which are held for
trading purposes
 approximate their carrying values because of the short term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest
rates are indicative of market interest rates.






    
    
    


We
adopted the FASB accounting guidance for share based payment transactions. This standard requires us to measure the cost of employee
services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options and applies to
all outstanding and vested stock-based awards.&#160;

In
computing the impact
 the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing
model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility and expected remaining lives of the awards. The
assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management&#8217;s bet estimates involve
inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and we use different assumptions
our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition
 we are required to estimate the
expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating our forfeiture rate
 we analyzed
our historical forfeiture rate
 the remaining lives of unvested options
 and the amount of vested option as a percentage of total
options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate
 or if we reevaluate the forfeiture
rate in the future
 the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current
period.

The
accounting guidance requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of each stock-based award. We use the Black-Scholes
model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted based on the following assumptions:

No
options were exercised in the year ended March 31
 2018 and 2017.






    
    
    


Except
as set forth below
 management does not believe that any other new accounting pronouncements not yet effective will have a material
impact on our financial statements once adopted.

In
May 2017
 FASB issued accounting standards update ASU-2017-09
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#8221; (Topic 718) &#8211;Modification
Accounting&#8221;
 to provide clarity and reduce both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the
guidance in Topic 718
 Compensation-Stock Compensation
 to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for annual periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim period for public entities for
reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued
 and all other entities for reporting periods for which
financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2017-09 on the Company&#8217;s financial statements.
