As used
herein
 the term &ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;us
&rdquo; &ldquo;our
&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Company&rdquo; refers to Fresh Promise
Foods
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation and subsidiaries unless otherwise noted.




We are an insolvent corporation. We have a history of
having no sales revenues
 negative cash flow and no profits and we cannot assure that we will ever be successful in generating
and sustaining any sales revenues
 positive cash flow or profits at any time in the future. We were originally incorporated in
the State of Delaware under the name
 PLR
 Inc. in 1993. Later we completed several name changes and reorganizations.

In November 1997
 we amended our Articles of Incorporation
to change our name to Integrated Carbonics Corp. We also changed our domicile to the State of Nevada. On July 23
 1999
 we again
amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Urbana.ca
 Inc. (&ldquo;URBA&rdquo;).


And on April
11
 2003
 we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to PSPP Holdings
 Inc. and later on August 11
 2008 we again
amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Cynosure Holdings
 Inc.

On August
21
 2008
 we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Mod Hospitality
 Inc. This was followed by a further
amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on December 16
 2009 wherein we changed our name to Stakool
 Inc.

On June 16
2011
 we entered into a Letter of Intent of Sale and Purchase with Anthus Life Corp.
 a privately held Nevada corporation (&ldquo;Anthus&rdquo;).
Subsequently and on July 20
 2011
 we and Anthus executed an Agreement of Sale and Purchase whereby Anthus stockholders received
77
588
470 shares of 79
388
470 shares of our then issued and outstanding common stock together with 10
000
000 shares of our
preferred stock in exchange for scheduled payments
 totaling $350
000 and 1
300
000 shares of our common stock (the &ldquo;Anthus
Acquisition Agreement&rdquo;).

Subsequently
the Stakool and Anthus Acquisition Agreement was amended effective January 19
 2012 to allow for the issuance of an additional
2
650
000 shares of our common stock to certain parties to acquire all of the then
outstanding
common stock of Anthus. As a result of the Anthus Acquisition Agreement
 Anthus became our wholly owne subsidiary and all of
the shares of our preferred stock and common stock were duly issued and the sum of $355
000 was duly paid in accordance with
that agreement.

Anthus was
incorporated in Nevada on June 4
 2009. At the time of the closing of the Anthus Acquisition Agreement
 Anthus was a developer
and manufacturer of certain natural and organic food products packaged for consumer consumption. At the time
 Anthus had one product
line in the natural food category and others that it believed could be viable commercial products.


However
 and in 2013 following our internal financial
evaluations
 we terminated the production of the Anthus products in light of our assessment of our limited ability to raise the
additional capital needed to market and sell the Anthus products.

On March 15
 2013 all of our officers and directors resigned
and Mr. Joseph C. Canouse was appointed as our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 and sole Director


While we believe that our Anthus product line may offer
good value to consumers
 we have not undertaken any product or market research to confirm our assessment. Even if the Anthus product
line has strong commercial value
 unless or until we have sufficient additional financial and managerial resources needed to undertake
the anticipated additional market research and the manufacturing
 marketing
 and promotional efforts that would be required to
implement any re-commercialization of the Anthus products
 we may not pursue any re-commercialization of the Anthus product line.
In the event that we are successful in obtaining sufficient additional capital
 we may
 if market conditions are favorable
 resume
production of one or more of the Anthus products. However
 we cannot assure you that we will obtain the additional capital that
will allow us to undertake these efforts or if we do obtain any additional capital
 that it can be obtained on reasonable terms
and in sufficient amounts on a timely basis that will allow us to implement any such efforts at any time in the future.


    
    



Effective
August 5
 2013
 we completed a 1 for 100 reverse stock split with the result that we reduced the number of our issued and outstanding
common shares from 2
903
888
889 to approximately 29
039
066 (the &ldquo;First Reverse Stock Split&rdquo;). Our consolidated financial
statements reflect the First Reverse Stock Split.

On September
26
 2013
 we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Fresh Promise Foods
 Inc. The amendment also reduced
the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 4
000
000
000 common shares to 475
000
000 common shares.

On May 13
2014
 we further amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares of our common stock from 475
000
000
common shares to 975
000
000 common shares.

On June 2
2014
 Joseph C. Canouse resigned as Chairman of our Board of Directors and as Chief Financial Officer of the Company
 and our
Board of Directors appointed Scott Martin as a Director and Secretary and Mr. Kevin P. Quirk was appointed Chairman of the Board.

On October
16
 2014
 we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 975
000
000
common shares to 2
000
000
000 common shares.

Effective
January 20
 2015
 we effected a 1-for-150 reverse split (the &ldquo;Second Reverse Stock Split&rdquo;) which as preceded by a
filing of an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation that we completed with the Nevada Secretary of State on December 30
 2014.

On January
6
 2016
 we entered into that certain Director Resignation and Release Agreement with Kevin P. Quirk (the &ldquo;Quirk Release
Agreement&rdquo;). In accordance with the Quirk Release Agreement
 Mr. Quirk resigned from his positions as our Chief Executive
Officer and Director in exchange for our release of Mr. Quirk from certain liabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

On July 12
2016
 we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the amount of our authorized common stock from 2
000
000
000
common shares to 5
000
000
000 common shares.

On June 27
2017
 we and Creative Edge Nutrition
 a Nevada corporation (&quot;CEN&quot;) entered into that certain asset purchase agreement
whereby we acquired certain assets and we assumed certain liabilities of CEN's subsidiary
 Giddy Up Energy Products
 Inc. (&quot;Giddy&quot;).
As consideration
 we also agreed to exchange 4
719
760
108 shares of its common stock. On January 24
 2018
 we completed the distribution
of its common shares to the CEN shareholders in order to consummate the acquisition of Giddy. Pursuant to the Agreement
 the Company
is in the process of spinning out its existing assets and liabilities and assuming Giddy's business plan involving nutritional
supplements and energy drinks focusing on an active lifestyle.

On August
23
 2017
 we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 5
000
000
000
common shares to 9
000
000
000 common shares.

On October
13
 2017
 we entered into that certain Director Resignation and Release Agreement with Scott C. Martin (the &ldquo;Martin Release
Agreement&rdquo;). In accordance with the Martin Release Agreement
 Mr. Martin resigned from his position as our Director in exchange
for our release of Mr. Martin from certain liabilities.

Discontinued
Operations

In light of
our legal proceedings involving certain former management of the Company
 we decided to discontinue our business operations of
our wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with our December
31
 2015 consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. In August 2018
 we executed a definitive agreement to sell
and transfer our equity interest in Harvest Soul.

Our results
of operations related to Harvest Soul have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all years
presented. Unless otherwise indicated
 the following discussions in this section (Item 1. Business) pertain only to our continuing
operations. For additional information see Note 3 &mdash; Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included
in this Form 10-K.

    
    



Current Products
 Potential
Product Categories and Product Extensions


We envision the Company as a consumer products company
focused on the health and wellness food and beverage sectors. We also view the Company as a brand acquisition and holding company.
Subject to the constraints and challenges that we face as summarized in our Risk Factors (and elsewhere in this Annual Report)
we may be able to offer products that we believe may provide health and wellness solutions that make sense and fit into the everyday
lives of certain consumer segments. While we have very limited managerial and financial resources
 we are focused on three strategic
areas: Food Technology
 Consumer Products and Value Added.

We believe that we may be different than many of our competitors
in that if we are able to secure the necessary financial and managerial resources on a timely basis and in sufficient amounts
we may be able to combine innovative technology and product development with perceptive marketing and sales service strategy.
Currently
 we own and operate subsidiaries in green and energy drink markets. See: www.drinkgiddyup.com.


Intellectual
Property

We have no
patented technology and we do not hold any patents that would otherwise serve to provide us with any protection of our intellectual
property rights. However
 our products are generally formulated utilizing our own proprietary formulations.

Production
Sources of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers


While our sole corporate officer
 Joe E. Poe
 Jr. (who
also has other full-time employment and who is not able to devote any full-time efforts to the Company) and our consultants have
reviewed
 studied and analyzed the natural and/or organic product market in certain product areas
 our strategy is to establish
a product procurement and development program that may allow us to obtain the assistance of marketing professionals. In all of
these efforts we may
 if our financial circumstances and market conditions allow
 offer us an opportunity to build our business
create brands through eco-friendly packaging and distinctive labeling
 and develop potentially key product distribution relationships
in selected geographic and certain markets that may offer us significant opportunities.


Marketing
Strategy

If we can
successfully implement our business strategy
 we seek to have our brand name strongly associated on with high quality products
that attract a strong consumer interest and to focus our efforts on finding and developing complimentary nutritional supplement
products for North America consumer market and beyond.

GIDDY UP Energy
Products is a wholesale manufacturer engaged in marketing and distribution of carbonated and non-carbonated energy drinks
 shakes
energy bars
 and related products. All of its manufacturing operations are conducted in accordance with GMP guidelines at GMP
Certified and/or FDA registered facilities. The website at www.giddyupenergyproducts.com.

Overall and
if we are able to obtain sufficient additional financial resources on a timely basis and if market conditions allow
 we seek to
become a leader in certain segments of the quality food and beverage business and
 in so doing
 set the standards of excellence
for food manufacturers as well. We are aware that our products will need to meet very high consumer expectations and provide greater
consumer value in an intensely competitive marketplace where other larger and well-established consumer package goods (CPG) manufacturers
have far greater financial
 managerial
 and marketing resources than we have and which we may have in the future. We do not anticipate
that competition in the CPG marketplace will decrease at any time in the future. And to the extent that we are able to implement
our strategy and our product and marketing plans
 there can be no guarantee that we will gain and later sustain any significant
share of the market and do so while also generating profits and positive cash flow. There are many large national and international
CPG companies that have nearly unlimited financial resources
 marketing budgets
 research staff
 and other resources that are
far beyond any that which we currently have and any that we likely will have in the future.

Our limited
in-house product research has led us to believe that there may be a sufficiently large consumer segment that may be attracted
to our products and the perceived health benefits
 product value
 and product taste of our products that may allow us to gain
sufficient product distribution and a retail presence in certain geographic markets.


While we have not obtained any independent third-party
evaluation of our plans and strategies
 we believe that words like &ldquo;natural
&rdquo; &ldquo;clean label
&rdquo; &ldquo;green
&rdquo;
&ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo;
 &ldquo;organic&rdquo;
 &ldquo;non-GMO&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; may be the new marketing
buzzwords in today&rsquo;s food and beverage industry. Products and ingredients bearing these tags appear to have created strong
consumer loyalty in certain consumer segments and among significant purchase influencers. We believe that products offered by
the CPG industry that possess natural and naturally derived ingredients are growing at above-market growth rates and that they
offer greater profit potential for food and beverage manufacturers. We also are aware that over the past two decades consumers
have become more health conscious with the result that products that are marketed with these buzzwords and offer good value to
the consumer at an attractive price point attract a loyal segment of the retail market with repeat consumer purchasing behavior.
In that respect
 we believe that many of these consumers may also view such products as a heathier choice than similar products
that do not possess these perceived better attributes. Some CPG marketers have also said that such products also promote the consumer
perception that they offer healthiness-on-the-go and beverages thus the perceived consumer value proposition is higher compared
to products in the same product category that do not offer these attributes. We have not undertaken any marketing or product research
and we have not engaged the services of any independent and professional marketing research firm to assist us in evaluating or
developing any of our assessments and we have no present plans to do so. As a result
 we may later discover that our plans and
strategies insufficiently and incorrectly mis-identify significant consumer and market trends with the result that we incur protracted
and significant losses with the result that persons who acquire our Common Stock
 our Preferred Stock or any other security that
we may issue lose all or substantially all of their investment.


    
    




We believe that there may be a sizable segment of the
CPG consumer market that understands and appreciates the &ldquo;health value&rdquo; offered by certain products and that this
segment may be willing to pay a premium for CPG products that include health ingredients
 which may promote general health and
well- being by preventing certain diseases. This is sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;health and wellness segment.&rdquo; However
we believe that the industry also confronts certain challenges in coping with the demand of natural ingredients used in food and
beverage applications
 particularly
 in terms of sustainability.

We also believe that this &ldquo;health and wellness&rdquo;
CPG segment may continue to increase and that this segment also may offer better profit margin potential as well. And we believe
that consumers are increasingly aware of the incidence of lifestyle-based disorders
 such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
 obesity
osteoporosis and diabetes
 among others. We believe that this general market awareness has served to further the sales growth
and the market share of products that are perceived as natural alternatives since this consumer segment perceives health benefits
that are not available from other CPG products that are not &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;organic.&rdquo; Other products contain
what some in the CPG industry refer to as &ldquo;synthetic ingredients&rdquo; in that they are not &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;organic.&rdquo;
We believe that this product differentiation has further cautioned consumers and it has allowed products that are marketed under
the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;organic&rdquo; moniker to have higher price points and higher margins. Consumers perceive
natural ingredients as having a positive impact on general health
 while synthetic ingredients have certain detrimental effects
on health. As a result
 food manufacturers have promptly responded to the situation by completely replacing or partially replacing
synthetic ingredients with their natural counterparts.

We also believe that CPG products that are marketed as
offering greater health and benefits products appear to be expanding faster than the overall market in many CPG segments. Thus
those products appear to be gaining market share. Overall
 there are many large
 well-established CPG companies that possess a
greater and far more sophisticated understanding of consumer trends and they have significant consumer research capabilities that
far exceeds our current capabilities and those that we likely will have in the future. However
 our assessments in all of these
matters are based solely upon the limited evaluations undertaken by our sole officer and director
 Joe E. Poe
 Jr. who can only
provide services to us on a limited
 part-time basis.




Consumer
Product Group (CPG)

If we are
successful in obtaining sufficient financial
 managerial
 and marketing resources on reasonable terms and on a timely basis and
provided that market conditions are favorable
 we believe that we may be able to implement our business plan in one or more CPG
product segments. In that respect
 we may build and in other cases buy certain companies that may offer us attractive acquisition
opportunities in one or more CPG health and wellness food and beverage market segments. While it is difficult to know the extent
of future market conditions and opportunities that may be available
 we anticipate that suitable acquisition targets that meet
our investment criteria share a number of common features:



    
    
A concept with substantial
    identifiable consumer demand which can be effectively replicated in multiple markets;

    
    
A unique brand asset
    capability that differentiates the company from its competition;

    
    
Attractive business
    model economics which address specific customer needs and demonstrate operational capabilities to achieve market leadership;

    
    
Strong management
    in place with a proven ability to execute a clearly defined strategic business plan;

    
    
A strong
 focused
    and customer-oriented culture;

    
    
Significant growth
    or growth potential and an expansion strategy that is consistent with the company&rsquo;s performance history;

    
    
A defensible and
    extendable position in a growing industry category.


We have observed
that beverage products marketed as &ldquo;a natural energy drink
 bursts with flavor and is packed with healthy essential benefits
such as dietary fiber
 anti-oxidants
 minerals along with vitamin C
 vitamin D
 B12
 B3 and B5 currently attract what appears
to be a strong and loyal consumer following. Some of these products also reference a blend of cherries and pears and the marketing
lines include a suggestion that the product is a crisp pick-me up to satisfy and quench thirst. Such product marketing obviously
requires a sophisticated understanding of consumer needs and the current consumer trends in selected consumer segments.




We face many large and highly successful and well-established
competitors who have a long history of success in marketing a large and diverse product line in the beverage industry and the
health drink product market segment. These competitors compete in multiple geographic and product markets with the help of internal
and external market CPG research that we will never likely possess at any time in the future. They are well-established
 multi-million-dollar
companies that possess a greater and far more sophisticated understanding of consumer trends and they have significant consumer
research capabilities that far exceeds our current capabilities and those that we likely will have in the future. Each of these
competitors also possess sophisticated marketing models
 a deep reservoir of experienced distributors and greater market research
capabilities than we will likely ever have. These advantages are augmented with far greater managerial and financial resources
that are far beyond and likely will be far beyond anything that we will ever possess. As a result
 any person who acquires our
Common Stock
 our Preferred Stock
 or any other security that we may issue should be prepared to lose their entire investment.


    
    






At the present time
 the Company has one employee who
is also our sole officer and Director
 Joe E. Poe
 Jr. He also is only able to devote a limited amount of time to the Company
in that he has other full-time employment.


Item 1A.
Risk Factors


Our business is subject to many significant business risks
that are largely beyond our control. We caution you that the following important factors
 among others
 could cause our actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the
SEC
 press releases
 communications with investors and oral statements. Our Common Stock and our Preferred Stock should be considered
a &ldquo;


We have not
attempted to rank any of the risks shown below but we caution you that any investment in our Company involves a substantially
high risk of loss. You should carefully consider the risks described below
 before you make any investment decision regarding
our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties
 including those generally affecting the market in which we operate or that we
currently deem immaterial
 may also impair our business. If any such risks actually materialize
 our business
 financial condition
and operating results could be adversely affected. In such case
 the trading price of our common stock could decline.

The following
risk factors are not exhaustive and the risks discussed herein do not purport to be inclusive of all possible risks but are intended
only as examples of possible investment risks. To facilitate understanding of the various business risks applicable to our Company
and the strategic alliance companies through which we intend to operate our business during the foreseeable future
 the risk factors
discussed herein address our Company together with the risks applicable to our operations that we intend to conduct with our strategic
alliance partners.

Risks Related
to our Business and Industry

WE ARE
SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN A NEW BUSINESS VENTURE


Our most recent balance sheet as of December 31
 2019
shows that our Total Liabilities exceed our Total Assets by over $5.1 million and we have only minimal working capital. As a result
we are insolvent
 and we face a clear risk of bankruptcy and other adverse action by our existing and future creditors. At present
we have no current definitive plan to raise any significant additional equity capital and we are not aware of any interest of
any underwriter
 placement manager or other funding source that has any interest in assisting us in obtaining additional capital.
As a result
 we face and continue to face a clear risk of insolvency
 bankruptcy
 and other adverse action by our existing and
future creditors. This risk is likely to increase over time as we incur additional liabilities.


WE HAVE
NO HISTORY OF PROFITABILITY AND GENERATING POSITIVE CASH FLOW.

We have no
history of generating profits and positive cash flow. As a result
 any purchase of our Common Stock is subject the investor to
total loss of their investment resulting from insolvency
 bankruptcy
 or some other action by our present and future creditors
since our common stock (and our preferred stock) is and will be subordinate to the rights of our existing and future creditors.

NEGATIVE
EQUITY AND ABSENCE OF WORKING CAPITAL.

Our most recent
balance sheet as of December 31
 2019 shows that our Total Liabilities exceed our Total Assets by over $5.0 million and we have
only minimal working capital. As a result
 we are insolvent
 and we face a clear risk of bankruptcy and other adverse action by
our existing and future creditors. At present
 we have no current plan to raise any significant additional equity capital and
we are not aware of any interest of any underwriter
 placement manager or other funding source that has any interest in assisting
us in obtaining additional capital. As a result
 we face and continue to face a clear risk of insolvency
 bankruptcy
 and other
adverse action by our existing and future creditors.

NEGATIVE
CASH FLOW.

We do not
have any history of generating and sustaining our operations with a positive cash flow. That is
 our operations have been characterized
by negative cash flows whereby our cash disbursements have exceeded our cash receipts. For these and other reasons
 any person
who acquires our Common Stock faces a significant risk of loss of their entire investment.

    
    


SUBSTANTIAL
LIKELIHOOD OF IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION.

While we have
no present plans to raise capital and no prospect that any additional capital can be raised in sufficient amounts
 on a timely
basis
 and on reasonable terms
 in the event that any significant additional capital is raised
 holders of our common stock face
a substantial likelihood of immediate and substantial dilution of their interests in the company.

ABSENCE
OF CONTROL AND AUTHORIZED &ldquo;BLANK CHECK&rdquo; PREFERRED STOCK. 

Any person
who acquires our Common Stock will not have any real ability to elect any Director to our Board of Directors or otherwise influence
or control the policies or direction of the Company since we previously issued shares of preferred stock to Joe E. Poe
 Jr. and
these shares possess super-voting rights that allows Joe E. Poe
 Jr. the unfettered to elect all Directors to our Board of Directors
and thereby control the Company. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors to authorize and
issue one or more series of our Preferred Stock each with such rights and privileges as our Board of Directors determines without
the necessity of obtaining any consent or approval of our common stockholders. As a result
 holders of our Common Stock have no
real ability to control or influence the Company at any time in the future.

COMMON
STOCK SUBORDINATE TO CLAIMS OF EXISTING AND FUTURE CREDITORS.

All of our
Common Stock is subordinate to the claims and interests of our existing and future creditors and as a result
 any person who acquires
our Common Stock is subject to a high risk of the total loss of their investment.

LIMITED
AND SPORADIC TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK.

Our Common
Stock is traded only on a limited and sporadic basis as an unlisted security on the OTC Market and there is no likelihood that
any liquid trading market will ever develop or if it does develop that any such market can be sustained. As a result
 holders
of our Common Stock may find it very difficult to undertake any re-sale of their holdings without incurring a prolonged delay
and likely at a significant discount to observed prices. For these reasons our Common Stock should not be considered a liquid
investment and it is entirely unsuitable for investors who seek to make only liquid investments.

NO LIKELIHOOD
OF DIVIDENDS.

We have no
history of profitability and
 for that matter
 we have no history of paying any dividends. In the unlikely event that we generate
profits
 if any
 we anticipate that all such profits will be reinvested into the Company.

ABSENCE
OF WORKERS&rsquo; COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND LIMITED INSURANCE COVERAGE.

We do not
have any workers&rsquo; compensation insurance coverage. As a result
 in the event that any employee of the Company suffers any
personal injury or any property damage while in the employ of the Company or in any capacity as an employee of the Company
 we
may be exposed to claims under applicable state laws involving tort claims for personal injury and property damage. The extent
of these claims could range from several tens of thousands of dollars to tens of millions of dollars. In addition
 we may be exposed
to claims from the Oklahoma Department of Insurance as well. As a result
 the Company is exposed to existential claims that could
result in insolvency and bankruptcy with the further result that persons who acquire our Common Stock could lose their entire
investment.

LIMITED
MANAGERIAL RESOURCES; LACK OF &ldquo;KEY MAN&rdquo; INSURANCE.

Currently
we have only one officer
 Mr. Joe E. Poe
 Jr. who is also our sole Director. As a result
 our ability to manage our business effectively
is constrained by the limited amount of our managerial resources and there can be no assurances that we can retain the services
of Mr. Joe E. Poe
 Jr. in the future and otherwise attract and retain other experienced
 talented
 and skilled management talent
necessary to execute our business plan. We have not entered into any employment agreement with Mr. Poe and we have no present
plans to enter into any such agreement. Further
 we do not have any &ldquo;key man&rdquo; life insurance on the life of Mr. Poe

in the future. The loss of Mr. Poe&rsquo;s services to the Company would likely result in protracted and serious financial losses
with the high likelihood that stockholders would lose all or nearly all of their investment.

    
    



It may be
more difficult for the Company to prepare for and respond to these types of risks and the risks described elsewhere in this Form
10-K than for a company with an established business and operating cash flow. If the Company is not able to manage these risks
successfully
 the Company&rsquo;s operations could be negatively impacted. Due to changing circumstances
 the Company may be forced
to change dramatically
 or even terminate
 its planned operations.

RISKS ASSOCIATED
WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF BUSINESS PLAN.


As a development-stage company
 we continue to face substantial
risks
 uncertainties
 expenses
 and difficulties in our efforts to implement our business plan. The extent of these risks is not
known and we have no demonstrable record of operations of any substance upon which anyone can evaluate our business and prospects.
Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks
 uncertainties
 expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies
in their early stages of development. We have not received and we do not anticipate receiving any independent third-party evaluation
of our business strategies or any of our plans and all of our decisions are made by our sole officer and director who can only
devote a limited amount of time to the Company since he has other full-time employment. For these and many other reasons
 we cannot
assure any purchaser of our common stock or our preferred stock that it will be successful in implementing our business plan or
otherwise achieving our objectives.


GOING CONCERN
QUALIFICATION AND QUALIFIED AUDITOR&rsquo;S OPINION.

As a result
of our negative equity
 our lack of working capital
 and our lack of revenues
 our independent auditors have raised substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Given these circumstances
 any person who acquires our Common Stock or
our Preferred Stock should be prepared to lose their entire investment.

CHANGES
IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DISCRETIONARY SPENDING MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUE
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION.

We are subject
to shifting and uncertain consumer preferences away from our products. Further we likely will be unable to develop new products
that appeal to consumers
 or changes in our product mix that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business.
Also
 our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending
 which is influenced by general economic
conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly
 we may experience declines in revenue during economic downturns
or during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect
on our sales
 results of operations
 business and financial condition.

FLUCTUATIONS
IN VARIOUS COMMODITY
 PACKAGING AND SUPPLY COSTS
 COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.


We are aware that the prices of the main ingredients in
our intended product offerings can be highly volatile. Supplies and prices of the various products that we plan to use to prepare
our products can be affected by a variety of factors
 such as weather
 seasonal fluctuations
 demand
 politics and economics in
the producing countries. An increase in pricing of any major ingredients that we use in our products could have a significant
adverse effect on our profitability. In addition; higher diesel prices have
 in some cases
 resulted in the imposition of surcharges
on the delivery of commodities to distributors. Additionally
 higher diesel and gasoline prices may affect our supply costs and
may affect our sales going forward. To help mitigate the risks of volatile commodity prices and to allow greater predictability
in pricing
 we hope that we may be able to enter into fixed price or to-be-fixed priced purchase commitments. We cannot assure
you that these activities will be successful or that they will not result in our paying substantially more than would have been
required absent such activities. We do not presently have any multi-year pricing agreements (with fixed processing costs)
 and
none with guaranteed volume commitments.




    
    

We
may not be able to prevent others from using our intellectual property
 and may be subject to claims by third parties that we
infringe on their intellectual property.


Our products are created using what we believe may be
proprietary formulations; however
 we have no registered patents. Preventing and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual
property is often difficult and any steps we take may not
 in every case
 prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties.
Further
 there can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our intellectual property will be successful.
We may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights
 which may result in substantial costs and diversion
of resources and management attention.


Further
 although
management does not believe that our products infringe on the intellectual rights of others
 there is no assurance that we will
not be the target of infringement or other claims. Such claims
 even if not true
 could result in significant legal and other
costs and may be a distraction to our management or interrupt our business.

LITIGATION
AND PUBLICITY CONCERNING PRODUCT QUALITY
 HEALTH AND OTHER ISSUES
 WHICH CAN RESULT IN LIABILITIES AND ALSO CAUSE CONSUMERS TO
AVOID OUR PRODUCTS
 WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

We are aware
that the beverage and food service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from consumers or government
authorities resulting from food and beverage quality
 illness
 injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from
one retail location or a limited number of retail locations. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us
regardless of whether the allegations are true
 by discouraging consumers from buying our products. We could also incur significant
liabilities
 if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us
 or litigation costs
 regardless of the result. We do not
carry any product liability and other related insurance and we have no present plans to do so. As a result
 we will be directly
exposed to all such claims and any related claims alleging losses due to our products and any asserted related losses with the
consequential result that holders of our Common Stock and our Preferred Stock could easily suffer the total loss of their investment.

BEVERAGE
AND FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS AND INSTANCES OF FOOD-BORNE ILLNESSES COULD HARM OUR CONSUMERS
 RESULT IN NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND CAUSE
THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF SOME CONSUMERS&rsquo; STORES AND
 IN SOME CASES
 COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF
FRUITS
 ANY OF WHICH COULD HARM OUR BRAND REPUTATION
 RESULT IN A DECLINE IN SALES OR AN INCREASE IN COSTS.


While we consider food and beverage safety a top priority
and we may
 if sufficient financial resources become available
 dedicate substantial resources towards ensuring that consumers
enjoy high-quality
 safe and wholesome products there can be no assurance that we may be able to implement any of our plans and
strategies. However
 we cannot guarantee that controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food-borne illnesses.
Furthermore
 reliance on third-party suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents (such as
E. coli
 Hepatitis A
 Salmonella or Listeria) could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations. We intend to utilize
High Pressure Processing (HPP) whenever possible to mitigate these risks.


Instances
of food-borne illnesses
 whether real or perceived
 and whether at our consumers&rsquo; stores or those of our competitors
 could
harm consumers and otherwise result in negative publicity about us or the products we serve
 which could adversely affect sales.
If there is an incident involving consumers&rsquo; C-stores and other approved channels serving contaminated products
 consumers
may be harmed
 our sales may decrease and our brand name may be impaired. If consumers become ill from food-borne illnesses
 we
could be forced to temporarily suspend some operations. If we react to negative publicity by changing our products or other key
aspects of the Fresh Promise experience
 we may lose consumers who do not accept those changes
 and may not be able to attract
enough new consumers to produce the revenue needed to make our operations profitable. In addition
 we may have different or additional
competitors for our intended consumers as a result of making any such changes and may not be able to compete successfully against
those competitors. Food safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food contamination have in
the past
 and could in the future
 adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause consumers to
shift their preferences
 particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers. As a result
 our costs
may increase and our sales may decline. A decrease in consumer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity
or as a result of a change in our products or smoothie experience or a temporary suspension of any of our consumer operations
could materially harm our business.


    
    

THE FOOD
SERVICE INDUSTRY HAS INHERENT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY NOT BE ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE.


We currently do not have any product liability insurance
or any related insurance. If we later acquire any such insurance
 we cannot assure you or any holder of our Common Stock that
we will carry sufficient insurance against all risks or that our insurers will pay a particular claim. In that event
 any holder
of our Common Stock
 our Preferred Stock
 or any other security that we issue is exposed to the certain HIGH RISK of loss of their
entire investment. Furthermore
 in the future
 we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for
our operations. We may also be subject to calls
 or premiums
 in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the
claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we may receive indemnity insurance
coverage for tort liability. Our insurance policies may also contain deductibles
 limitations and exclusions which
 although we
may believe are standard in the food service industry
 may nevertheless increase our costs.



WE FACE UNCERTAINTY IN OUR EFFORTS TO GAIN AND SUSTAIN
ANY RETAIL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PLANNED PRODUCTS.



We have not determined if we can achieve any retail distribution
for our planned products and how or where any such distribution may be achieved and
 if achieved
 that it can be sustained. Since
we have no working capital and we have negative equity
 we are not able to predict if and when we may be able to undertake any
efforts to implement our business plan
 if ever. In the event that that we are successful in overcoming these and other significant
financial challenges
 we are aware that our future results depend on various factors
 including successful selection of new markets
market acceptance of our brands
 consumer recognition of the quality of our products and willingness to pay our prices (which
reflect our often-higher ingredient costs
) the quality and performance of our equipment and general economic conditions. In addition
as with the experience of other retail food and beverage concepts who have tried to expand nationally
 we may find that our product
concepts have limited or no appeal to consumers in new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of our brands.
We are also aware that any newly opened stores may not succeed
 future markets may not be successful and average store revenue
may not meet expectations. Moreover
 we anticipate that we may incur significant and protracted losses and negative cash flow
for several years
 at a minimum. As a result
 investors who acquire our Common Stock
 our Preferred Stock
 or any security
 should
be prepared to lose their entire investment. Our securities should be considered &ldquo;HIGH RISK&rdquo; securities.


OUR FAILURE
TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.


Our plans call for a significant increase in the number
of consumers. Product supply
 financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion.
Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems
 procedures
 and controls and to hire
 train
and retain management and staff. Since we have only one officer/Director (who has other full-time employment) and no other employees
we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management
 employees and existing
infrastructure. We also place a lot of importance on our culture
 which we believe will be an important contributor to our success.
As we grow
 however
 we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations.
Our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results with the result that we may face significant
and protracted losses thereby.



OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY
AND COULD FALL BELOW THE EXPECTATIONS OF INVESTORS DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.


factors
 including:



    
    
The impact of inclement weather
 natural disasters and other calamities
 such as earthquakes and/or hurricanes
 which could cause a delay in getting our products to our consumers;

    
    
    

    
    
Profitability of our operations where our products are sold
 especially in new markets;

    
    
Changes in comparable store sales and consumer visits
 including the introduction of new product items;

    
    
Variations in general economic conditions
 including those relating to changes in diesel and gasoline prices;

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    



Because of
these factors
 results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for
any year. Average consumers&rsquo; store revenue or comparable store revenue in any particular future period may decrease. In
the future
 our operating results may fall below the expectations of investors. In that event
 the value of our Common Stock or
other securities would likely decrease.

    
    



OUR CONSUMERS
AND SUPPLIERS COULD TAKE ACTIONS THAT HARM OUR REPUTATION AND REDUCE OUR PROFITS.

Consumers
and suppliers are separate entities and are not our employees. Further
 we do not exercise control over the day-to-day operations
of our consumers and suppliers. Any operational shortcomings of our consumers and suppliers are likely to be attributed to our
system-wide operations and could adversely affect our reputation and have a direct negative impact on our profits.&nbsp;

OUR REVENUE
IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY BASED ON WEATHER AND VARIES BY SEASON.

Seasonal factors
could also cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue may be lower during the winter months and the holiday
season and during periods of inclement weather and higher during the spring
 summer and fall months. Our revenue will likely also
vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the number of trading days
 that is
 the number of days in a quarter when stores are
open.&nbsp;

WE COULD
FACE LIABILITY FROM OUR CONSUMERS
 SUPPLIERS OR GOVERNMENT.

A consumer
supplier or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the consumer/ supplier relationships. Various state and
federal laws govern our relationship with consumers and suppliers. If we fail to comply with these laws
 we could be liable for
damages to consumers or suppliers and fines or other penalties. Expensive litigation with our consumers/suppliers or government
agencies may adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our consumer/suppliers.

WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.


We are aware that our business may require significant
capital in the future each year and for many years even if we can implement our business plans. We are also aware that any business
that grows typically has negative cash flow as funds are needed to support higher levels of inventory and receivables together
with higher advertising and marketing expenditures. As a result of these and related circumstances and even if we are successful
in implementing our business plan
 any person who acquires our Common Stock or our Preferred Stock will likely suffer significant
and immediate dilution and otherwise become subordinate to the rights and claims of creditors. In addition
 any financing that
we obtain may not
 however
 be available on terms favorable to us
 or at all. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be
subject to various factors
 including market conditions
 our operating performance
 lender sentiment and our ability to incur
additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions
 such as financial covenants under our credit facility. These
factors may make the timing
 amount
 terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital
could impede our growth. Any person who acquires our securities should be prepared to lose all of their investment.


THE MARKETING
AND SALE OF A CONSUMER PRODUCT EXPOSES US TO SIGNIFICANT RISK OF LITIGATION TOGETHER WITH THE DISTRACTION OF OUR LIMITED MANAGEMENT
INCREASING OUR EXPENSES OR SUBJECTING US TO MATERIAL MONEY DAMAGES AND OTHER REMEDIES.

The marketing
of any consumer product is highly risky. We are aware that consumers could file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that
we are responsible for some illness or injury their consumers suffered at or after a visit to their stores
 or that we have problems
with food quality or operations. We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business
including personal injury claims

of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters
 discrimination and similar matters
 and we could become subject
to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future. Regardless of whether any claims against
us are valid
 or whether we are ultimately held liable
 claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from
our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially
and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations
may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects
 which in turn could adversely affect our results. The food
and beverage services industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products
they sell and disclosure and advertising practices. We have no present plans to obtain insurance coverage for these risks or any
risks associated with or arising out of any product that we plan to market and sell in the future. As a result
 in the event that
we incur costs and liabilities as a result of or associated with our planned offering and sale of our products
 we likely will
face protracted and significant financial costs and protracted losses thereby with the result that anyone who acquires our Common
Stock or our Preferred Stock likely will lose their entire investment.

    
    



WE MAY
ALSO INCUR COSTS RESULTING FROM OTHER SECURITY RISKS WE MAY FACE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ELECTRONIC PROCESSING AND TRANSMISSION
OF CONFIDENTIAL CONSUMER INFORMATION.


In the event that we are able to implement our business
plan then we are likely to face the risks from using commercially available software and other technologies to provide security
for processing and transmission of consumer credit card data. Our systems could be compromised in the future
 which could result
in the misappropriation of consumer information or the disruption of systems. Either of those consequences and other events could
have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business or subject it to additional liabilities with consequential and significant
financial losses arising thereby.


WE ARE
EXPOSED TO INCREASED COSTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGING LAWS
 REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS IN GENERAL
 AND
SPECIFICALLY WITH INCREASED AND NEW REGULATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND DISCLOSURE STANDARDS.

We expect
to spend an increased amount of management time and external resources to comply with existing and changing laws
 regulations
and standards in general
 and specifically relating to corporate governance. In particular
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 requires management to annually review and evaluate all of our internal control systems
 and file attestations of
the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent auditors. This process may require us to hire additional
personnel and use outside advisory services and result in additional accounting and legal expenses. If in the future our chief
executive officer
 chief financial officer or independent auditors determine that our controls over financial reporting are not
effective as defined under Section 404
 investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the value
of our stock. If our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation of management&rsquo;s assessment of
our internal control over financial reporting
 or disclaim an ability to issue an attestation
 it could result in a loss of investor
confidence in our financial reports
 adversely affect our stock value and our ability to access the capital markets or borrow
money. Failure to comply with other existing and changing laws
 regulations and standards could also adversely affect the Company.

THE REPORT
OF OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS INDICATES UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN AND THIS MAY IMPAIR OUR
ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL TO FUND OUR BUSINESS PLAN.

Our independent
auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We cannot assure you that this will not
impair our ability to raise capital on attractive terms. Additionally
 we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve significant
revenues and therefore remain a going concern.&nbsp;

COMPETITORS
WITH MORE RESOURCES MAY FORCE US OUT OF BUSINESS.


In the event that we have sufficient financial resources
we anticipate that we will compete with many large and well-established companies
 food and beverage service
 C-stores and other
approved channels and otherwise
 on the basis of taste
 quality and price of product offered
 consumer service
 atmosphere
 location
and overall guest experience. Aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could
reduce our revenue and profit margins and otherwise result in significant financial losses that could result in insolvency or
bankruptcy.


    
    



WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO ATTAIN PROFITABILITY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY BE UNAVAILABLE.


We have negative equity of $5.1 million as of December
31
 2019
 minimal working capital and no clear plan to raise additional capital. To date
 hawse have funded our operations with
minimal financial resources
 and we have not generated sufficient cash from operations to be profitable or to maintain sufficient
inventory. Unless we are successful in generating sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern while also achieving
profitability and positive cash flow
 the Company may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency
problems may force the Company to cease operations if additional financing is not available.


THE COST
TO MEET OUR REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY SUBECT TO THE EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY
RESULT IN US HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS OR EVEN MEET ROUTINE BUSINESS OBLIGATIONS.


Securities
Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting
 legal
and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements that could limit our ability to invest in inventory
 accounts
receivable
 marketing
 product development
 and other necessary expenditures. These costs directly reduce any funds that we may
have to meet our financial obligations to creditors or otherwise sustain the existence of the Company.


WE MAY
HAVE DIFFICULTY IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING MANAGEMENT AND OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS A RESULT OF
THEIR CONCERNS RELATING TO THEIR INCREASED PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO LAWSUITS AND STOCKHOLDER CLAIMS BY VIRTUE OF HOLDING THESE POSITIONS
IN A PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY.

We are aware
that directors and management of publicly-traded corporations are increasingly concerned with the extent of their personal exposure
to lawsuits and stockholder claims
 as well as governmental and creditor claims which may be made against them
 particularly in
view of recent changes in securities laws imposing additional duties
 obligations and liabilities on management and directors.
Due to these perceived risks
 directors and management are also becoming increasingly concerned with the availability of directors&rsquo;
and officers&rsquo; liability insurance to pay on a timely basis the costs incurred in defending such claims. We currently do
not carry directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance. Directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance has
recently become much more expensive and difficult to obtain. If we are unable to provide directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo;
liability insurance at affordable rates or at all
 it may become increasingly more difficult to attract and retain qualified outside
directors to serve on our board of directors.

We may lose
potential independent board members and management candidates to other companies that have greater directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo;
liability insurance to insure them from liability or to companies that have revenues or have received greater funding to date
which can offer more lucrative compensation packages. The fees of directors are also rising in response to their increased duties
obligations and liabilities as well as increased exposure to such risks. As a company with a limited operating history and limited
resources
 we will have a more difficult time attracting and retaining management and outside independent directors than a more
established company due to these enhanced duties
 obligations and liabilities.

WE MAY
NOT ACHIEVE RESULTS SIMILAR TO ANY CURRENT OR FUTURE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS.


Projections and estimated financial results are based
on estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and
 though considered reasonable by us
 are subject to significant
business
 economic
 and competitive uncertainties and contingencies
 all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are
beyond our control. Accordingly
 there can be no assurance that the projected results will be realized or that actual results
will not be significantly lower than projected. Neither we nor any other person or entity assumes any responsibility for the accuracy
or validity of the projections. All of our plans and projections have not received any independent or third-party evaluation by
anyone and are the result of the limited review provide solely by our one (1) part-time officer and Director
 Joe E. Poe.


    
    


Risks Related
to an Investment in our Common Stock

OUR DIRECTORS
HAVE THE RIGHT TO AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK.


Our directors
 within the limitations and restrictions
contained in our articles of incorporation and without further action by our stockholders
 have the authority to issue shares
of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to fix the number of shares and the relative rights
 conversion
rights
 voting rights
 and terms of redemption
 liquidation preferences and any other preferences
 special rights and qualifications
of any such series. Any issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock.
Any such action would also likely and significantly reduce the value of our existing Common Stock and our existing Preferred Stock.


IF THERE
IS A MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES IN THE FUTURE
 OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE AND ILLIQUID.

We can make
no assurance that there will be a public market for our common Stock in the future. If there is a market for our Common Stock
in the future
 we anticipate that such market may be illiquid and might be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several
factors
 including
 but not limited to the following factors:



    
(1)
    
actual or anticipated
    variations in our results of operations;

    
    
our ability or inability
    to generate new revenue;

    
    
our ability to anticipate
    and effectively adapt to a developing market;

    
    
our ability to attract
    retain and motivate qualified personnel;

    
    
consumer satisfaction
    and loyalty;

    
    
increased competition;
    and

    
    
conditions and trends
    in the market for organic and natural products.


CONVERSION
OF OUR PROMISSORY NOTES OR SALES OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK INTO THE PUBLIC MARKET BY SELLING SHAREHOLDERS
MAY CAUSE A REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK AND PURCHASERS WHO ACQUIRE SHARES FROM THE SELLING SHAREHOLDERS MAY LOSE SOME
OR ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENTS.

If a market
for our shares develops
 sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could cause a reduction
in the price of our Common Stock. If selling Shareholders resell a substantial portion of the issued and outstanding shares of
our Common Stock it could have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock. As a result of any such decreases in the price
of our Common Stock
 purchasers who acquire shares from Selling Shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.

OUR EXISTING
SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL AND IMMEDIATE DILUTION.

In the event
that we are able to implement our business plan
 we will need to raise significant additional capital from the sale of debt
 equity
or both. Any funds
 and these funds may not be available on favorable terms
 or at all. Furthermore
 if we issue debt or equity
securities to raise additional funds
 our existing shareholders will experience substantial and immediate dilution
 and the new
debt or equity securities may have rights
 preference
 and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. If we cannot
raise funds on acceptable terms
 we may not be able to develop or enhance our products
 execute our business plan
 take advantage
of future opportunities
 or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated consumer requirements.



There is no assurance that we will be profitable
 and
we may not be able to successfully develop
 manage or market our products and services. We may not be able to attract or retain
qualified executives and technological personnel and our products and services may become obsolete. Government regulation may
hinder our business. Additional dilution in outstanding stock ownership will be incurred due to the issuance of more shares
 stock
options
 or the exercise of stock options
 and other risks inherent in our business.

Since we cannot be assured of any immediate improvement
in our profitability
 our cash flow
 or both of them
 any person who acquires our Common Stock
 our Preferred Stock
 or any other
security that we may offer
 will likely incur substantial dilution and diminution in their interest in the Company and thereby
&rdquo; securities
that are suitable only for those who can afford to lose their entire investment.


    
    

Currently
there is a public market for our securities
 but there can be no assurances that the public market will develop further and
 if
developed further
 it is likely to experience significant price fluctuations.

We have a
trading symbol for our common stock
 namely &lsquo;FPFI&rsquo;. There can be no assurances as to whether:



    
    
the market for our
    shares will continue to develop; or

    
    
the prices at which
    our common stock will trade;


Prices for
our common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors
 including the depth and liquidity
of the market for shares of our common stock
 developments affecting our business
 including the impact of the factors referred
to elsewhere in these risk factors
 investor perception of our Company and general economic and market conditions.

WE ARE
SUBJECT TO THE PENNY SOCK RULES WHICH WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK MORE DIFFICULT TO SELL.

We are subject
to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules because our securities sell below $5.00 per share. The penny stock rules require
broker-dealers to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks
and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid
and offer quotations for the penny stock
 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson
 and monthly account statements
showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&rsquo;s account. In addition
 the bid and offer quotations
and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing
the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&rsquo;s confirmation.


Furthermore
 the penny stock rules require that prior
to a transaction
 the broker dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for
the purchaser and receive the purchaser&rsquo;s written agreement to the transaction. The penny stock rules are burdensome and
may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for our securities. As long as our securities are subject
to the penny stock rules
 the holders of such securities will find it more difficult to sell their securities and any person who
acquires our securities will not likely have any continuous liquid trading market that will allow them to sell these securities
in the future.


SHARES
ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE BY OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE.

The sale of
a significant number of shares of common stock at any particular time could be difficult to achieve at the market prices prevailing
immediately before such shares are offered. In addition
 sales of substantial amounts of common stock
 including shares issued
upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants
 under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 144 or otherwise could adversely
affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital at that time through the
sale of our securities.&nbsp;

STATUS
OF &ldquo;PENNY STOCK&rdquo; AND IMPACT ON MARKET LIQUIDITY.

Trading
in our Common Stock is limited. Consequently
 a shareholder may find it more difficult to dispose of
 or to obtain accurate quotations
as to the price of
 our Common Stock. In the absence of a security being quoted on NASDAQ
 or the Company having $2
000
000 in
net tangible assets
 trading in the Common Stock is covered by Rule 3a51-1 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the 
 as amended for non-NASDAQ and non-exchange listed securities. Under such rules
broker/dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions
with assets in excess of $5
000
000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1
000
000 or an annual income exceeding $200
000
or $300
000 jointly with their spouse) must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser's written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. Securities are also exempt from this rule if the market price is
at least $5.00 per share
 or for warrants
 if the warrants have an exercise price of at least $5.00 per share. The Securities
Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 requires additional disclosure related to the market for penny stocks and for trades
in any stock defined as a penny stock. The Commission has adopted regulations under such Act which define a penny stock to be
any NASDAQ or non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price or exercise price of less than $5.00 per share and allow for
the enforcement
against violators of the proposed rules. In addition
 unless exempt
 the rules require the delivery
 prior to any transaction
involving a penny stock
 of a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission explaining important concepts involving a penny stock
market
 the nature of such market
 terms used in such market
 the broker/dealer's duties to the customer
 a toll-free telephone
number for inquiries about the broker/dealer's disciplinary history
 and the customer's rights and remedies in case of fraud or
abuse in the sale. Disclosure also must be made about commissions payable to both the broker/dealer and the registered representative
current quotations for the securities
 and
 if the broker/dealer is the sole market maker
 the broker/dealer must disclose this
fact and its control over the market. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock
held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. While many NASDAQ stocks are covered by the proposed
definition of penny stock
 transactions in NASDAQ stock are exempt from all but the sole market-maker provision for (i) issuers
who have $2
000
000 in tangible assets has been in operation for at least three years ($5
000
000 if the issuer has not been in
continuous operation for three years)
 (ii) transactions in which the customer is an institutional accredited investor
 and (iii)
transactions that are not recommended by the broker/dealer. In addition
 transactions in a NASDAQ security directly with the NASDAQ
market maker for such securities
 are subject only to the sole market-maker disclosure
 and the disclosure with regard to commissions
to be paid to the broker/dealer and the registered representatives. The Company's securities are subject to the above rules on
penny stocks and the market liquidity for the Company's securities could be severely affected by limiting the ability of broker/dealers
to sell the Company's securities.

    
    



LIKELIHOOD
OF GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL OF OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS.

Companies
have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings alleging
 among other things
 violations of federal and state
workplace and employment laws. Proceedings of this nature
 if successful
 could result in our payment of substantial damages.

Our results
of operations may be adversely affected by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of employees or consumers.
In recent years
 a number of companies
 including juice companies
 have been subject to lawsuits
 including class action lawsuits
alleging violations of federal and state law. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial awards by
the defendants. Although we are not currently a party to any material class action lawsuits
 we could incur substantial damages
and expenses resulting from lawsuits
 which would increase the cost of operating the business and decrease the cash available
for other uses.

WE ARE
SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION.

We are subject
to various federal
 state and local regulations and we likely will face greater regulations in the future. Our products are subject
to state and local regulation by health
 sanitation
 food and workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material
difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new products which could delay planned execution
of our business plan. We are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give civil rights
protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment
 public accommodations and other areas. We may in the
future have to modify office and warehouse space
 for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures
to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. The expenses associated with these modifications
could be material. Our operations are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act
 which governs such matters as minimum
wages
 overtime and other working conditions
 along with the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act
 family leave mandates and a
variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters. In addition
 federal proposals
to introduce a system of mandated health insurance and flexible work time and other similar initiatives could
 if implemented
adversely affect our operations. In recent years
 there has been an increased legislative
 regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition
and advertising practices in the food industry. As a result
 we may in the future become subject to initiatives in the area of
nutrition disclosure or advertising
 such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our products
which could increase our expenses.

AS A PUBLIC
COMPANY
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND WILL
EXPOSE US TO RISK OF NON-COMPLIANCE.

As a public
company
 we are subject to numerous legal and accounting requirements that do not apply to private companies. The cost of compliance
with many of these requirements is material
 not only in absolute terms but
 more
importantly
in relation to the overall scope of the operations of a small company. Our relative inexperience with these requirements may increase
the cost of compliance and may also increase the risk that we will fail to comply.

Failure to
comply with these requirements can have numerous adverse consequences including
 but not limited to
 our inability to file required
periodic reports on a timely basis
 loss of market confidence and/or governmental or private actions against us. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to comply with all of these requirements or that the cost of such compliance will not prove to be a substantial
competitive disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis our privately held and larger public competitors.

    
    



WE MAY
BE SUBJECT TO SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION
 THEREBY DIVERTING OUR RESOURCES THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

As discussed
in the preceding risk factors
 the market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared
to seasoned issuers
 and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite
future. In the past
 plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of
volatility in the market price of its securities. We may become the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation will result
in substantial costs and liabilities and will divert management&rsquo;s attention and resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Legal Proceedings

On April 25
2013
 Richard Maher
 et al (collectively
 the &ldquo;Plaintiffs&rdquo;) filed a complaint with the United States District Court
for the District of Nevada (the &ldquo;Court&rdquo;) alleging claims including securities fraud and breach of contract against
Peter Hellwig
 et al (collectively
 the &ldquo;Defendants&rdquo;). On March 30
 2017
 the Court issued an order granting in part
motion for default judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs. On January 1
 2018
 the Company issued three convertible notes to settle
legal damages totaling $693
819 awarded to the Plaintiffs after pursuing all potential remedies against the other Defendants.

On April 5
2018
 David G. Wiser filed a lawsuit against the Company for debt acquired in the asset purchase agreement with Creative Edge
Nutrition due to the non-convertibility of his debt resulting from the lack of shares available to issue while the Company was
delinquent in its filings with the SEC. On April 27
 2018
 the lawsuit was settled when the Company issued Mr. Wiser one preferred
share convertible into 850
000
000 shares of common stock.


We are not currently involved in any litigation that we
believe could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Except as set forth above
we are not aware of any outstanding action

 proceeding
 inquiry or investigation before or by any court
 public board

or our Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries&rsquo; officers or directors in their capacities as such
 in which an adverse decision could
have a material adverse effect. We may discover that one or more actions or suits have been filed against us. As a result
 we
cannot assure you that we may be exposed to claims and liabilities that result in the Company becoming insolvent with the further
result that any person who acquires our Common Stock
 our Preferred Stock
 or any other securities that we have issued
 suffer
the total loss of their investment.

Plan
of Operations

Our plan is
to develop our brand name
 to have it strongly associated with all of our distributed products and to focus on finding and developing
the best nutritional supplement product options for North America and beyond.


GIDDY UP Energy Products was a wholesale manufacturer
engaged in a limited amount of marketing and distribution of carbonated and non-carbonated energy drinks
 shakes
 energy bars
and related products. The company was a subsidiary of Creative Edge Nutrition
 a nutritional supplement company focused on developing
innovative
 high quality supplements. The company manufactures under strict GMP guidelines at GMP Certified and/or FDA registered
facilities (visit our website at www.giddyupenergyproducts.com for more information).

An experienced but limited core management team is in
place and has
 on a limited basis
 reviewed
 studied and analyzed the natural and/or organic product market. In the event that
the Company can secure additional capital in sufficient amounts and on a timely basis
 the Company may be able to establish a
procurement program and may be able to work with outside professionals to build its business
 create brands through eco-friendly
packaging and distinctive labeling
 and develop key distribution relationships.


Basis
of Presentation

Our financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates
 judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates
 judgments
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates
 judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates
 judgments
 and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.
In many cases
 the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management&rsquo;s
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management&rsquo;s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.&nbsp;

Results
of Operations for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018



We did not
record any revenues for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018. As discussed above
 we discontinued our operating subsidiary
Harvest Soul which had been our sole source for sales revenue in prior year periods. We are contemplating various opportunities
as a means to generate future sales revenue; however
 we can provide no assurance that our efforts will successfully result in
any new revenues.

Gross
Margin

Gross margin
is calculated by subtracting cost of sales from revenue. Gross margin percentage is calculated by dividing gross margins by revenue.

We did not
record any cost of goods sold for either of the years ended December 31
 2019
 and 2018. As such
 we did not realize any gross
margin for either of the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018.



    
    

Operating
Expenses

Operating
expenses from continuing operations totaled $141
255 for the year ended December 31
 2019
 compared to $945
857 in operating expenses
from continuing operations for the year ended December 31
 2018
 or a decrease of $804
602.

Our operating
expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and benefits
 professional fees and other general and administrative costs. The
decrease in operating expenses from continuing operations was primarily due to certain legal matters that were settled during
the year ended December 31
 2018. See Item 1. Legal Proceedings. On January 1
 2018
 the Company issued three convertible notes
to settle legal damages totaling $693
819 awarded to the Plaintiffs after pursuing all potential remedies against the other Defendants.
On April 27
 2018
 the Company issued one share of convertible
 preferred stock to settle a legal matter totaling $60
000.


We expect our operating expenses to increase proportionally
to our business activities as we begin to execute upon our Plan of Operations in future periods. We also anticipate incurring
additional costs and expenses as a result of our lack of positive cash flow and lack of profits.


Other
Income (Expense)

Net other
expenses totaled $824
431 for the year ended December 31
 2019
 compared to $1
188
117 in net other expenses for the year ended
December 31
 2018.

The Company
has issued various convertible notes to help finance its operations
 some of which have embedded derivative features. The value
of these instruments will fluctuate as the trading price of our common stock changes. During the year ended December 31
 2019
we recorded an unrealized loss of $292
536
 compared to an unrealized gain of $2
174
882 from the change in the value of these
derivative features. During the year ended December 31
 2019 we did not record any derivative liability expense
 compared to $2
374
508
of expense recorded during the year ended December 31
 2018.

During the
year ended December 31
 2019
 we recorded interest expense related to the amortization of debt discounts totaling $17
347 compared
to $698
638 during the year ended December 31
 2018.

Net
loss from continuing operations

We incurred
a net loss from continuing operations of $965
686
 or $0.00 per share
 for the year ended December 31
 2019
 compared to a net
loss of $2
133
974
 or $0.00 per share
 for the year ended December 31
 2018.

The weighted
average number of basic and fully diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31
 2019 was 8
833
435
867
 compared
to 8
657
514
707 for the year ended December 31
 2018. There are no dilutive equivalents included in our calculation of fully
diluted shares for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive due to our net loss
per share.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
 among
other things
 the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

The Company
sustained a net loss of $965
686 for the year ended December 31
 2019. Because of the absence of positive cash flows from operations
the Company requires additional funding to execute upon its Plan of Operation. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

We are presently
unable to meet our obligations as they come due. At December 31
 2019
 we had $19 in assets and a working capital deficit of $5
122
952.
Our working capital deficit is largely due to the balance of our convertible notes payable and related derivative liabilities.


    
    

During the
year ended December 31
 2019
 we used net cash of $55
669 from our operating activities from continuing operations compared to
$63
180 cash used in our operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31
 2018.

During the
year ended December 31
 2019
 net cash provided by our financing activities from continuing operations was $55
500 compared to
$63
368 cash provided by or used in our financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31
 2018.


We anticipate that our cash requirements will arise from
the need to fund our growth from operations
 pay current and prior period obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary
sources of funding in the near term for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from raising additional funds by the
issuance of convertible notes. However
 we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or
obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us if at all
 to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern
is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain
profitability. In addition
 our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations.
We are presently engaged in capital raising activities through one or more private offerings of our company&rsquo;s securities.
See &ldquo;Note 2&ndash; Going Concern&rdquo; in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that
we may not be able to continue as a &ldquo;going concern.&rdquo;


Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We do not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We do not
hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.

FRESH PROMISE
FOODS INC.

CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER
31
 2019 AND DECEMBER 31
 2018

    
    



Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Fresh Promise Foods
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fresh Promise Foods
 Inc. as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the related
statements of operations
 stockholders' equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the &quot;financial statements&quot;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material
respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (&quot;PCAOB&quot;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Substantial
Doubt about the Company&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the financial statements
 the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated
deficit. In addition
 the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

FRESH PROMISE
FOODS
 INC.
NOTES TO
THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended
December 31
 2019 and 2018

NOTE 1 &ndash; NATURE OF BUSINESS
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Fresh Promise
Foods
 Inc. (&ldquo;Fresh Promise&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a consumer products and marketing company focused on
the high-margin
 multi-billion-dollar health and wellness food and beverage sectors.

On June 27
2017
 Creative Edge Nutrition
 a Nevada corporation (&quot;CEN&quot;) and Fresh Promise executed an asset purchase agreement whereby
the Company purchased the assets and liabilities of CEN's subsidiary
 Giddy Up Energy Products
 Inc. (&quot;Giddy&quot;). As consideration
the Company agreed to exchange 4
719
760
108 shares of its common stock. On January 24
 2018
 the Company completed the distribution
of its common shares to the CEN shareholders in order to consummate the acquisition of Giddy. Pursuant to the Agreement
 the Company
is in the process of spinning out its existing assets and liabilities and assuming Giddy's business plan involving nutritional
supplements and energy drinks focusing on an active lifestyle.

Going
Concern

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following
the date of these financial statements. On a consolidated basis
 the Company has incurred significant operating losses since its
inception.

Because the
Company does not expect that existing operational cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations
 this
raises substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore
 the Company will need to
raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing. Historically
 the Company has raised capital
through the issuance of convertible debt as a measure to finance working capital needs. The Company will be required to continue
to do so until such time that its consolidated operations become profitable.

Discontinued
Operations

In light of
the Company&rsquo;s legal proceedings involving certain former management
 Fresh Promise decided to discontinue its business operations
of its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with the Company&rsquo;s
December 31
 2015 consolidated financial statements. In August 2018
 Fresh Promise executed a definitive agreement to sell and
transfer its equity interest in Harvest Soul.

The Company&rsquo;s
results of operations related to Harvest Soul have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all
years presented. For additional information see Note 3 &mdash; Discontinued Operations.

Basis
of Presentation

The Company
uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;US GAAP&rdquo;).
The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year-end.

The consolidated
financial statements include the financial statements of Fresh Promise Foods Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul
Inc. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company and subsidiary have been eliminated upon consolidation.



    
    

Use of
Estimates

The preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience
known or expected trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable given the quality of information available
as of the date of these financial statements. The results of these assumptions provide the basis for making estimates about the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.



Fresh Promise
Foods Inc. considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
places its cash with a high credit quality financial institution. The Company&rsquo;s account at this institution is insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&ldquo;FDIC&rdquo;) up to $250
000. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
the Company did not have bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such
financial institution
 the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institution in which it holds deposits.&nbsp;

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The Company&rsquo;s
financial instruments are carried at the approximate fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate
prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.



Goodwill represents
the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.
The goodwill arising from the Company&rsquo;s acquisitions is attributable to the value of the potential expanded market opportunity
with new customers. Intangible assets have either an identifiable or indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable
useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life
 whichever is shorter.

Goodwill and
indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing unless circumstances dictate more frequent
assessments. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment for goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and more
frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying
amount. Goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process performed at the reporting unit level. Step one compares the fair value
of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by considering both the income
approach and market approaches. The fair values calculated under the income approach and market approaches are weighted based
on circumstances surrounding the reporting unit. Under the income approach
 the Company determines fair value based on estimated
future cash flows of the reporting unit
 which are discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing
and risk of cash flows. For the discount rate
 the Company relies on the capital asset pricing model approach
 which includes
an assessment of the risk-free interest rate
 the rate of return from publicly traded stocks
 the Company&rsquo;s risk relative
to the overall market
 the Company&rsquo;s size and industry and other Company-specific risks. Other significant assumptions used
in the income approach include the terminal value
 growth rates
 future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital
requirements. The market approaches use key multiples from guideline businesses that are comparable and are traded on a public
market. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount
 there is no impairment. If the reporting
unit&rsquo;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
 then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment
if any. Step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net
assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one. In this step
 the fair value
of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the reporting unit&rsquo;s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price
allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired on that date. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair
value of goodwill
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.


    
    

Determining
the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions
 including
revenue growth rates
 strategic plans
 and future market conditions
 among others. There can be no assurance that the Company&rsquo;s
estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.
Changes in assumptions and estimates could cause the Company to perform an impairment test prior to scheduled annual impairment
tests scheduled in the fourth quarter.

As of December
31
 2019
 the Company did not have any goodwill or indefinite-lived assets.

Net
Income (Loss) per Common Share

Net income
(loss) per share is calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 260
 &ldquo;Earnings per Share.&rdquo; Basic net income (loss) per
common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at December 31
 2019 and 2018. Diluted
earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company&rsquo;s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted
number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had convertible
notes outstanding that could be converted into approximately 23
377
136
247 and 21
654
839
992 common shares based up the closing
bid price of the company&rsquo;s common stock at December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. Shares which would result from the
conversion of the convertible notes were excluded from the calculation of net loss per share for 2019 and 2018 because the effect
would be anti-dilutive.



ASC 718
 Compensation
&ndash; Stock Compensation
 prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee
services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities
 or issuing or offering to issue shares
 options
 and other
equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees
 including
grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values.
That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award
known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).

On June 20
2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and
services. Under the ASU
 most of the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based
payments granted to employees. Equity classified share-based payments for employees was fixed at the time of grant. Equity-classified
nonemployee share-based payment awards are measured at the grant date of the award which is the same as share-based payments for
employees. The Company adopted the requirements of the new rule as of January 1
 2019
 the effective date of the new guidance.

No share-based
expenses were recorded for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019 and 2018.

Income
Taxes

The Company
accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10
 &ldquo;Accounting for Income Taxes
&rdquo; which requires
among other things
 an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities

A valuation
allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the
net deferred asset will not be realized.

The Company
follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to
 Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed
it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others are
subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the
period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination

of appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions
that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50
percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain
tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing
authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions will be highly certain of being upheld upon examination.
As such
 the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.

    
    



The Company
has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement
 which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position
is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can
be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax
positions considered effectively settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit
 even if the tax position is
not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations
remains open. Management has not filed tax returns for the years ended December 31
 2014
 through 2019. The tax year 2013 remains
open for examination.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

Except for
rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered
standards
 the FASB Accounting Standards Codification&trade; (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature
recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes
any effect will not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s present or future financial statements.&nbsp;

In December
2019
 the FASB issued ASU 2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740)
 which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting
guidance
 including requirements such as tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination
ownership changes in investments
 and interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law. The amendment will be effective
for public companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020; early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating
the impact of this amendment on its consolidated financial statements.

In February
2020
 the FASB issued ASU 2020-02
 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to SEC
Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which amends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting
companies. ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2022. The Company believes the adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial instruments
 but
it does not anticipate a material impact on results of operations. The Company is in the process of determining the effects adoption
will have on its consolidated financial statements

NOTE 2
&ndash; GOING CONCERN

The Company&rsquo;s
consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow
it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining
adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital
 it
could be forced to cease operations.

The Company
incurred a net loss of $965
686 for the year ended December 31
 2019 and a working capital deficit of $5
122
952 at December 31
2019. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.

In order to
continue as a going concern
 the Company will need
 among other things
 additional capital resources. Management&rsquo;s plan
to obtain such resources for the Company include

 institutions
and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However
 management cannot provide any assurance
that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.

    
    



There is no
assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds
 if available
 will
be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition
 profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues
received from business operations. However
 there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern.

NOTE 3
&ndash; DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In light of
the Company&rsquo;s legal proceedings involving certain former management
 Fresh Promise decided to discontinue its business operations
of its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with the Company&rsquo;s
December 31
 2015 consolidated financial statements.

The Company
made the decision to impair all of the assets of Harvest Soul resulting in a charge of $217
728 in 2015. The decision to impair
the assets was made as Harvest Soul was operating autonomously during the legal proceedings
 and the Company determined that the
assets presented it with no future economic benefit. The impairment charge is reflected under operating expenses in the operating
results from discontinued operations summarized below.

Effective
August 28
 2018
 the Company executed an assignment and assumption agreement with Harvest Soul
 LLC (the &ldquo;Purchaser&rdquo;)
providing for the sale of certain assets and the assignment of certain (i) notes payable
 (ii) accrued salaries and (iii) contracts
(collectively the &ldquo;Assumed Liabilities&rdquo;) to Purchaser and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Purchaser.

899
209
and $1
699

The value
of the derivative liabilities was determined using the following Black-Scholes methodology:

The Company has no history
    or expectation of paying cash dividends on its common stock.

    U.S. Treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected life of the promissory notes in effect at the time of issuance.

    
The volatility of the Company&rsquo;s common
    stock is based on trading activity for the previous contractual term ended at each promissory note issuance date.

Company has no provisions from income tax in 2019

NOTE 8
&ndash; FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company
has adopted the guidance under ASC Topic 820 for financial instruments measured on a fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic
820 establishes a fair value hierarchy
 giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority
to unobservable data and requires disclosures for assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy.
Further authoritative accounting guidance (ASU No. 2009-05) under ASC Topic 820
 provides clarification that in circumstances
in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liabilities is not available
 a reporting entity is required to
measure fair value using one or more of the techniques provided for in this update.

The standard
describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of input
 of which the first two are considered observable and the last
unobservable
 that may be used to measure fair value
 which are the following:

Level 1 &ndash;
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2 &ndash;
Input other than Level 1 that are observable
 either directly or indirectly
 such as quoted prices for similar assets of liabilities;
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the full term of the asset or liabilities.

Level 3 &ndash;
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities.&nbsp;

Our assessment
of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment
 and considers factors
specific to the asset or liability.

The Company
analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480
 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity&rdquo; and ASC 815
 &ldquo;Derivatives and Hedging&rdquo;. Derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value
at each period end
 with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to
fair value of derivatives. The effects of interactions between embedded derivatives are calculated and accounted for in arriving
at the over- all fair value of the financial instruments. In addition
 the fair value of free-standing derivative instruments
such as warrant and option derivatives are valued using the Black-Scholes modes.

The Company
uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the embedded conversion option liabilities as their fair value were determined
by using the Black Scholes option-pricing model based on various assumptions. The Company&rsquo;s derivative liabilities are adjusted
to reflect fair value at each period end
 with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations
as adjustments to fair value of derivatives.

The following
table summarizes the change in the Company&rsquo;s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31
2018:

Item 9.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants and Financial Disclosure

Effective
May 1
 2018
 the Company dismissed D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. as its independent registered public accounting firm and engaged
BF Borgers CPA PC as its independent registered public accounting firm. D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. audited our financial statements
for the periods ended December 31
 2014 and December 31
 2013 and reviewed the financials prepared by the previous public accounting
firm for the period ended December 31
 2012. The dismissal of D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. was approved by our Board of Directors
effective May 1
 2018. D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. did not resign or decline to stand for re-election.

During our
two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period preceding our decision to dismiss D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A.
we had no disagreements with the firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices
 financial statement disclosure
 or
auditing scope of procedure which disagreement if not resolved to the satisfaction of D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. would have
caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report.

During our
two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period prior to retaining BF Borgers CPA PC (1) neither we nor anyone
on our behalf consulted BF Borgers CPA PC regarding (a) either the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction
either completed or proposed
 or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements or (b) any matter
that was the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and (v)
 respectively
 of Regulation
S-K
 and (2) BF Borgers CPA PC did not provide us with a written report or oral advice that they concluded was an important factor
considered by us in reaching a decision as to accounting
 auditing or financial reporting issue.

Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange
Act&rdquo;))
 in connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 as of December 31
 2019.

Based on the
review described above
 our Chief Executive Officer determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of the end of the period covered by this report.

(b) Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were
no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred subsequent to our evaluation of our internal
control over financial reporting for the period ended December 31
 2019 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely
to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.&nbsp;

Our Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting under the supervision of the
President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management
evaluated the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019
 based on the framework
and criteria established in Internal Control &ndash; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in May 2013
 and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting were not
effective.



    
    

An evaluation
was performed
 under the supervision of
 and with the participation of
 our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&rsquo;s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-(e) to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that
evaluation
 our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not adequate and effective
 as of December 31
 2019
 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that it files or submits under the 
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission&rsquo;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

We do not
expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all
fraud. A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives
of the system are met and cannot detect all deviations. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation
of control can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or deviations
 if any
 within the Company
have been detected.

This report
does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management&rsquo;s report in this report.

 Inc. (&amp;#8220;Fresh Promise&amp;#8221;&#13;or the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;) is a consumer products and marketing company focused on the high-margin

 2017
 Creative Edge Nutrition
&#13;a Nevada corporation (&amp;#34;CEN&amp;#34;) and Fresh Promise executed an asset purchase agreement whereby the Company purchased the assets&#13;and liabilities of CEN's subsidiary
 Giddy Up Energy Products
 Inc. (&amp;#34;Giddy&amp;#34;). As consideration
 the Company agreed to&#13;exchange 4
719
760
108 shares of its common stock. On January 24
 2018
 the Company completed the distribution of its common shares&#13;to the CEN shareholders in order to consummate the acquisition of Giddy. Pursuant to the Agreement

 which contemplates the realization of assets and the&#13;satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following the date of these financial&#13;statements. On a consolidated basis

 this raises substantial doubt about the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore
 the Company will need to raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative&#13;sources of financing. Historically

 Fresh Promise decided to discontinue its business operations of its wholly-owned subsidiary&#13;Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with the Company&amp;#8217;s December 31
 2015 consolidated&#13;financial statements. In August 2018


000. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company did not have bank balances exceeding&#13;the FDIC insurance limit. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institution


 the Company determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit
&#13;which are discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows. For the discount&#13;rate
 the Company relies on the capital asset pricing model approach
 which includes an assessment of the risk-free interest rate
&#13;the rate of return from publicly traded stocks
 the Company&amp;#8217;s risk relative to the overall market
 the Company&amp;#8217;s size&#13;and industry and other Company-specific risks. Other significant assumptions used in the income approach include the terminal value
&#13;growth rates
 future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements. The market approaches use key multiples&#13;from guideline businesses that are comparable and are traded on a public market. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater&#13;than its carrying amount
 there is no impairment. If the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
 then the&#13;second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment
 if any. Step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill&#13;by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting&#13;unit as calculated in step one. In this step
 the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s&#13;assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired on that date. If&#13;the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill

 including revenue growth rates
 strategic&#13;plans
 and future market conditions

 2019

 &amp;#8220;Earnings per Share.&amp;#8221; Basic net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted&#13;average number of shares of common stock outstanding at December 31
 2019 and 2018. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by&#13;dividing the Company&amp;#8217;s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding&#13;during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for&#13;any potentially dilutive debt or equity. At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had convertible notes outstanding that could&#13;be converted into approximately 23
377
136
247 and 21
654
839
992 common shares based up the closing bid price of the company&amp;#8217;s&#13;common stock at December 31
 2019 and 2018

 Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation
&#13;prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired.&#13;Transactions include incurring liabilities
 or issuing or offering to issue shares
 options
 and other equity instruments such&#13;as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees
 including grants of employee&#13;stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized&#13;over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award

 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-07&#13;which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and services. Under the ASU
 most of&#13;the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees.&#13;Equity classified share-based payments for employees was fixed at the time of grant. Equity-classified nonemployee share-based&#13;payment awards are measured at the grant date of the award which is the same as share-based payments for employees. The Company&#13;adopted the requirements of the new rule as of January 1
 2019


 &amp;#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes
&amp;#8221; which requires
 among other things

 Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed
 it is highly certain that some positions&#13;taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of&#13;the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
&#13;the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which
 based on all available evidence
&#13;management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of&#13;appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that&#13;meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent&#13;likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax&#13;positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits&#13;in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities&#13;upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions will be highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such

 which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the&#13;purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the&#13;completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished.

 Creative Edge Nutrition
 a Nevada corporation (&amp;#34;CEN&amp;#34;) and Fresh Promise executed an asset purchase agreement whereby&#13;the Company purchased the assets and liabilities of CEN's subsidiary
 Giddy Up Energy Products
 Inc. (&amp;#34;Giddy&amp;#34;). As consideration
&#13;the Company agreed to exchange 4

108 shares of its common stock. On January 24

 the Company completed the distribution&#13;of its common shares to the CEN shareholders in order to consummate the acquisition of Giddy. Pursuant to the Agreement


 which contemplates&#13;the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following&#13;the date of these financial statements. On a consolidated basis

 this&#13;raises substantial doubt about the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore
 the Company will need to&#13;raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing. Historically


 Fresh Promise decided to discontinue its business operations&#13;of its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;December 31
 2015 consolidated financial statements. In August 2018

    



000. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
&#13;the Company did not have bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such&#13;financial institution

    


 the Company determines fair value based on estimated&#13;future cash flows of the reporting unit
 which are discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing&#13;and risk of cash flows. For the discount rate
 the Company relies on the capital asset pricing model approach
 which includes&#13;an assessment of the risk-free interest rate
 the rate of return from publicly traded stocks
 the Company&amp;#8217;s risk relative&#13;to the overall market
 the Company&amp;#8217;s size and industry and other Company-specific risks. Other significant assumptions used&#13;in the income approach include the terminal value
 growth rates
 future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital&#13;requirements. The market approaches use key multiples from guideline businesses that are comparable and are traded on a public&#13;market. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount
 there is no impairment. If the reporting&#13;unit&amp;#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
 then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment
&#13;if any. Step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net&#13;assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one. In this step
 the fair value&#13;of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price&#13;allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired on that date. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair&#13;value of goodwill

 &amp;#8220;Earnings per Share.&amp;#8221; Basic net income (loss) per&#13;common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at December 31
 2019 and 2018. Diluted&#13;earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company&amp;#8217;s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted&#13;average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted&#13;number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had convertible&#13;notes outstanding that could be converted into approximately 23

 Compensation&#13;&amp;#8211; Stock Compensation
 prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee&#13;services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities
 or issuing or offering to issue shares
 options
 and other&#13;equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees
 including&#13;grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values.&#13;That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award

&#13;2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and&#13;services. Under the ASU
 most of the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based&#13;payments granted to employees. Equity classified share-based payments for employees was fixed at the time of grant. Equity-classified&#13;nonemployee share-based payment awards are measured at the grant date of the award which is the same as share-based payments for&#13;employees. The Company adopted the requirements of the new rule as of January 1
 2019



 &amp;#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes
&amp;#8221; which requires
 among other things

 Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed
 it is highly certain that some positions&#13;taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of&#13;the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
&#13;the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which
 based on all available evidence
&#13;management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of&#13;appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that&#13;meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent&#13;likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax&#13;positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits&#13;in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities&#13;upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions will be highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such

 which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the&#13;purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the&#13;completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively&#13;settled

statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not
yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating
losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital
 it could be forced to cease operations.

NOTE 3
&#8211; DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In light of
the Company&#8217;s legal proceedings involving certain former management
 Fresh Promise decided to discontinue its business operations
of its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with the Company&#8217;s
December 31
 2015 consolidated financial statements.

The Company
made the decision to impair all of the assets of Harvest Soul resulting in a charge of $217
728 in 2015. The decision to impair
the assets was made as Harvest Soul was operating autonomously during the legal proceedings
 and the Company determined that the
assets presented it with no future economic benefit. The impairment charge is reflected under operating expenses in the operating
results from discontinued operations summarized below.

Effective
August 28
 2018
 the Company executed an assignment and assumption agreement with Harvest Soul
 LLC (the &#8220;Purchaser&#8221;)
providing for the sale of certain assets and the assignment of certain (i) notes payable
 (ii) accrued salaries and (iii) contracts
(collectively the &#8220;Assumed Liabilities&#8221;) to Purchaser and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Purchaser.

The operating
results of the Company&#8217;s Harvest Soul subsidiary classified as discontinued operations are summarized below:

NOTE 7
&#8211; INCOME TAXES

As of December
31
 2019
 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $14.0 million that may be available to reduce our
tax liability through tax year 2038. We estimate the benefits of this loss carry forward at $2.9 million if the Company produces
sufficient taxable income. No adjustments to the financial statements have been recorded for this potential tax benefit.&#160;The
Company has no provisions from income tax in 2019
 due to current period losses and full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

A reconciliation
of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate is as follows:

Fresh Promise
Foods
 Inc. (&#8220;Fresh Promise&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a consumer products and marketing company focused on
the high-margin
 multi-billion-dollar health and wellness food and beverage sectors.

On June 27
2017
 Creative Edge Nutrition
 a Nevada corporation (&#34;CEN&#34;) and Fresh Promise executed an asset purchase agreement whereby
the Company purchased the assets and liabilities of CEN's subsidiary
 Giddy Up Energy Products
 Inc. (&#34;Giddy&#34;). As consideration
the Company agreed to exchange 4
719
760
108 shares of its common stock. On January 24
 2018
 the Company completed the distribution
of its common shares to the CEN shareholders in order to consummate the acquisition of Giddy. Pursuant to the Agreement
 the Company
is in the process of spinning out its existing assets and liabilities and assuming Giddy's business plan involving nutritional
supplements and energy drinks focusing on an active lifestyle.




Going
Concern

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following
the date of these financial statements. On a consolidated basis
 the Company has incurred significant operating losses since its
inception.

Because the
Company does not expect that existing operational cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations
 this
raises substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore
 the Company will need to
raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing. Historically
 the Company has raised capital
through the issuance of convertible debt as a measure to finance working capital needs. The Company will be required to continue
to do so until such time that its consolidated operations become profitable.




Discontinued
Operations

In light of
the Company&#8217;s legal proceedings involving certain former management
 Fresh Promise decided to discontinue its business operations
of its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with the Company&#8217;s
December 31
 2015 consolidated financial statements. In August 2018
 Fresh Promise executed a definitive agreement to sell and
transfer its equity interest in Harvest Soul.

The Company&#8217;s
results of operations related to Harvest Soul have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all
years presented. For additional information see Note 3 &#8212; Discontinued Operations.




Basis
of Presentation

The Company
uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;US GAAP&#8221;).
The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year-end.

The consolidated
financial statements include the financial statements of Fresh Promise Foods Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul
Inc. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company and subsidiary have been eliminated upon consolidation.

of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience
known or expected trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable given the quality of information available
as of the date of these financial statements. The results of these assumptions provide the basis for making estimates about the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.






Fresh Promise
Foods Inc. considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
places its cash with a high credit quality financial institution. The Company&#8217;s account at this institution is insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to $250
000. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
the Company did not have bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such
financial institution
 the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institution in which it holds deposits.&#160;





Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The Company&#8217;s
financial instruments are carried at the approximate fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate
prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.






Goodwill represents
the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.
The goodwill arising from the Company&#8217;s acquisitions is attributable to the value of the potential expanded market opportunity
with new customers. Intangible assets have either an identifiable or indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable
useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life
 whichever is shorter.

Goodwill and
indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing unless circumstances dictate more frequent
assessments. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment for goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and more
frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying
amount. Goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process performed at the reporting unit level. Step one compares the fair value
of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by considering both the income
approach and market approaches. The fair values calculated under the income approach and market approaches are weighted based
on circumstances surrounding the reporting unit. Under the income approach
 the Company determines fair value based on estimated
future cash flows of the reporting unit
 which are discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing
and risk of cash flows. For the discount rate
 the Company relies on the capital asset pricing model approach
 which includes
an assessment of the risk-free interest rate
 the rate of return from publicly traded stocks
 the Company&#8217;s risk relative
to the overall market
 the Company&#8217;s size and industry and other Company-specific risks. Other significant assumptions used
in the income approach include the terminal value
 growth rates
 future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital
requirements. The market approaches use key multiples from guideline businesses that are comparable and are traded on a public
market. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount
 there is no impairment. If the reporting
unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
 then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment
if any. Step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net
assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one. In this step
 the fair value
of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the reporting unit&#8217;s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price
allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired on that date. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair
value of goodwill
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.

Determining
the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions
 including
revenue growth rates
 strategic plans
 and future market conditions
 among others. There can be no assurance that the Company&#8217;s
estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.
Changes in assumptions and estimates could cause the Company to perform an impairment test prior to scheduled annual impairment
tests scheduled in the fourth quarter.

As of December
31
 2019
 the Company did not have any goodwill or indefinite-lived assets.




Net
Income (Loss) per Common Share

Net income
(loss) per share is calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 260
 &#8220;Earnings per Share.&#8221; Basic net income (loss) per
common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at December 31
 2019 and 2018. Diluted
earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#8217;s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted
number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had convertible
notes outstanding that could be converted into approximately 23
377
136
247 and 21
654
839
992 common shares based up the closing
bid price of the company&#8217;s common stock at December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. Shares which would result from the
conversion of the convertible notes were excluded from the calculation of net loss per share for 2019 and 2018 because the effect
would be anti-dilutive.






ASC 718
 Compensation
&#8211; Stock Compensation
 prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee
services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities
 or issuing or offering to issue shares
 options
 and other
equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees
 including
grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values.
That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award
known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).

On June 20
2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and
services. Under the ASU
 most of the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based
payments granted to employees. Equity classified share-based payments for employees was fixed at the time of grant. Equity-classified
nonemployee share-based payment awards are measured at the grant date of the award which is the same as share-based payments for
employees. The Company adopted the requirements of the new rule as of January 1
 2019
 the effective date of the new guidance.

No share-based
expenses were recorded for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019 and 2018.







to the provisions of ASC 740-10
 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes
&#8221; which requires
 among other things
 an asset and liability
approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases
of assets and liabilities


any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.


740 -10 related to
 Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed
 it is highly certain that some positions
taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of
the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which
 based on all available evidence
management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of
appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that
meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent
likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax
positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits
in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities
upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions will be highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such
 the
Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.


of Settlement
 which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the
purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the
completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively
settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit
 even if the tax position is not considered more likely than
not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. Management has
not filed tax returns for the years ended December 31
 2014
 through 2019. The tax year 2013 remains open for examination.






Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

Except for
rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered
standards
 the FASB Accounting Standards Codification&#8482; (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature
recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes
any effect will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s present or future financial statements.&#160;

In December
2019
 the FASB issued ASU 2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740)
 which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting
guidance
 including requirements such as tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination
ownership changes in investments
 and interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law. The amendment will be effective
for public companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020; early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating
the impact of this amendment on its consolidated financial statements.

In February
2020
 the FASB issued ASU 2020-02
 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to SEC
Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which amends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting
companies. ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2022. The Company believes the adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial instruments
 but
it does not anticipate a material impact on results of operations. The Company is in the process of determining the effects adoption
will have on its consolidated financial statements
