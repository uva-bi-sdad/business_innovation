The broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock must furnish his customer a document containing information prescribed by the SEC and obtain from the customer an executed acknowledgment of receipt of that document. The broker or dealer must also provide the customer with pricing information regarding the security prior to the transaction and with the written confirmation of the transaction. The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction and with the written confirmation of the trade. The broker or dealer must also send an account statement to each customer for which he has executed a transaction in a penny stock each month in which such security is held for the customer's account. The existence of these rules may have an effect on the price of our stock

There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance.&nbsp;We are in the early stages of developing operations.&nbsp;We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise
 including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns
 such as increases in marketing costs
 increases in administration expenditures associated with daily operations
 increases in accounting and audit fees

500 in cash for a total of $1
500 in assets for February 28
 2015. In management's opinion
 the Company's cash position is insufficient to maintain its operations at the current level for the next 12 months. Any expansion may cause the Company to require additional capital until such expansion began generating revenue. It is anticipated that the raise of additional funds will principally be through the sales of our securities. As of the date of this report
If the Company is not able to raise or secure the necessary funds required to maintain our operations and fully execute our business
As of February 29

The Company's officers
 directors and principal shareholders have verbally agreed to provide additional capital
 up to $100

 to the Company to fund it current operations until the Company can raise additional capital. As of the date of this filing
 the Company owes WB Partners LLC approximately $103

In the opinion of management
 available funds will not satisfy our growth requirements for the next twelve months. We believe our currently available capital resources will allow us to begin operations and maintain its operation over the course of the next 12 months; however
We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive exploration activities. These reasons raise substantial doubt for our auditors about our ability to continue as a going concern. Without realization of additional capital
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition

Our critical accounting policies
 including the assumptions and judgments underlying them
It is the company's policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 Revenue Recognition. Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options
 using treasury stock method
 and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents pertaining to the convertible debt
 options
 warrants and convertible preferred shares were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss for the year ended February 28
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based compensation plans. It defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts for compensation cost for stock option plans and for share based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 718. Accordingly
 employee share-based payment compensation is measured at the grant date
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. Additionally
Management does not believe that any recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncements
 if adopted
We are an emerging growth company as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 commonly referred to as the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years
 or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion
 (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including
In addition
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision
 an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. In other words
 an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of such accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies until the first to occur of the date the subject company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B). The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period and
 as a result
 our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. Accordingly
 until the date that we are no longer an emerging growth company or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B)
 upon the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to your financial statements and has a different effective date for public and private companies

Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management

 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company and its subsidiary as of February 29
 2016 and February 28

 assets or liabilities. The Company selected February 28 as its fiscal year end. In September 2015
Von Baron Farms: In September 2015
The company began distributing product at&nbsp;www.vonbaronfarms.com&nbsp;in November 2015. In November 2015 entered into distribution contracts for its products in dispensaries. In March 2016

The Company terminated its relationship as online distributor for Nate's Food Co. and closed the online store on November 20
For purposes of the statement of cash flows
The Company applies Topic 718 Share-Based Payments (Topic 718) to share-based compensation
The Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees (Topic No. 505-50). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
It is the company's policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 Revenue Recognition. Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue earning activities are recognized upon the sale of its products. As of February 28
 2015
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence
ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260
. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at February 28
 2015
The Company has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognized assets and liabilities ('fair value hedges'). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold
 terminated or exercised
As defined in ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
Level 2 &#8211; Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
 as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps

 net proceeds of $45
000 upon closure of the agreement
 on which the Company recognized a pro-rated OID of $15
000 in addition to the cash proceeds and two investor notes for $50
000 each. The debt is convertible upon effective date of the note
 debt holder can convert into common stock at .30 unless market capitalization falls below $10M at any time in which the conversion rate is reset to lower of conversion price and market price with a true-up provision. In addition to the convertible note
 the Company granted to the same investor the right to purchase
 at anytime

000 fully paid and non-assessable cashless warrants of Company's common stock. The exercise price of the cashless $0.30 unless
 while warrant is outstanding
 the Company sells any common stock
 debt
 warrants
 options
 preferred shares or other instruments or securities which are convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock
The Company identified conversion features embedded within convertible debt and warrants issued during 2015. The Company has determined that the conversion feature of the Notes and warrants represents an embedded derivative since the Notes include a reset provision which could cause adjustments upon conversion. Accordingly
Therefore
 the fair value of the derivative instruments have been recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded as discounts to the Notes. Such discounts will be accreted from the issuance date to the maturity date of the Notes. The change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities will be recorded in other income or expenses in the statement of operations at the end of each period

We have not had any disagreements with our auditors on any matters of accounting principles
 practices
Our principal executive and principal financial officers have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a &#8211; 15(e) and 15d &#8211; 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods required under the SEC's rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 as appropriate
Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to Rule 308(b) of Regulation S-K
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 30
 2013. Based on this assessment
 management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as a result of the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. In making this assessment
 management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 or COSO. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company's internal control system
 including (i) the control environment
 (ii) risk assessment
 (iii) control activities
 (iv) information and communication
A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency
 or combination of control deficiencies
Management identified the following material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of February 29
&nbsp;Ineffective controls over financial reporting: The company intends to hire additional staff members
 either as employees or consultants
&nbsp;prior to February 28
 2018. These additional staff members will be responsible for making sure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported as and when required and will the staff members will have segregated responsibilities with regard to these responsibilities. The costs associated with the hiring the additional staff members will increase the Company's Sales
 General and Administration (SG&amp;A) Expense. It is anticipated the cost of the new staff members will be approximately $60
: After the election of the independent directors at the 2015 annual shareholder meeting
: As of April 30
 2015
 we have no full-time employees with the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. As a result
: We lack written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions
 including revenue
 cost of sales and inventory transactions
 and preparing
 A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency
 or combination of control deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company will need to hire additional staff to assist that the Company has sufficient controls in place. It is anticipated the cost of the new staff members will be approximately $60
As our resources allow
 we will add financial personnel to our management team. We plan to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions
As of June 15
 2016
 the Company has not taken any remediation actions to address these weaknesses in our controls even though they were identified during the year. The Company's management expects
 once it is in the financial position to do so
 to hire additional staff in its accounting department to be able to segregate the duties. The Company expects that the expense will be approximately $60
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 29
 2016
 that occurred during our fourth quarter that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect

 &amp;#34;&lt;i&gt;Earnings&#13;per Share&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#34;. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income&#13;statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average&#13;number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares&#13;outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In&#13;computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased&#13;from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.&#13;As at February 28

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected&#13;to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect&#13;on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that&#13;includes the enactment date.

A
summary of significant accounting policies of 1PM Industries
 Inc. (the &#34;Company&#34;) is presented to assist in understanding
the Company's financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements.
These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company's management who are responsible for their integrity and
objectivity.

Organization
Nature of Business and Trade Name

Our
business address is 312 S. Beverly Drive #3102
 Beverly Hills
 California 90212. 1PM Industries (&#34;1PM&#34;
 &#34;we&#34;
&#34;us&#34;
 &#34;our&#34;
 the &#34;Company&#34; or the &#34;Registrant&#34;) was originally incorporated in the State
of Colorado on March 26
 1990 under the name of Southshore Corporationand changed our name to Torrent Energy Corp. on July 15
2004 and changed our name to 1PM Industries on February 19
 2015. On June 5
 2014
 the Company executed a merger with Embarr Farms
Inc. On June 5
 2014
 the Company entered into an Agreement whereby the Company acquired 100% of Embarr Farms
 Inc. Embarr Farms
was the surviving Company and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and changed the name of the Company to 1PM Industries.
At the time of the merger
 the Company had no operations
 assets or liabilities. The Company selected February 28 as its fiscal
year end. In September 2015
 the Company launched a medical marijuana edible line under the brand name &#34;Von Baron Farms&#34;.
Von Baron Farms is wholly owned (100%) subsidiary of the Company.

Business
Of The Registrant

Von
Baron Farms: In September 2015
 the Company launched a medical marijuana edible line under the brand name &#34;Von Baron Farms&#34;.
The Company performed test marketing at 3 HempCon conventions and in dispensaries in Northern California.

The
company began distributing product at&#160;www.vonbaronfarms.com&#160;in November 2015. In November 2015 entered into distribution
contracts for its products in dispensaries. In March 2016
 the Company begun selling product to dispensaries.

The
Company is also in the process of selling its Von Baron Farms product line in non-medical marijuana product line through Amazon
and eBay. As such
 part products to solely focus on its
own products.

In
January 2016
 the Company has begun development of a CBD product line that will be capable of being sold nationwide.

NewGenica
Brand: In March 2015
 the Company developed a line health and wellness products under the &#34;NewGenica&#34; brand. The Company
developed 4 products under this brand which are: AquaTrim
 DreamTrim
 Eat &#38; Trim and D-Tox 15. The Company purchases the products
from a 3rd party manufacturer who private labels health and wellness products. The Company has not begun selling products under
the NewGenica brand as it has focused primarily on its Von Baron product line.

Resell/Private
Label: During the period
 the Company entered into an agreement with Nate's Food Co. to be the exclusive online distributor of
products under the brand Nate's Homemade. The products were available under the Company's website www.nateshomemadestore.com.
The Company terminated its relationship as online distributor for Nate's Food Co. and closed the online store on November 20
2015.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. A change in managements' estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on 1PM Industries financial condition and
results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Nate's
Food Co.'s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their
financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.

Share-Based
Compensation

The
Company applies Topic 718 &#34;Share-Based Payments&#34; (&#34;Topic 718&#34;) to share-based compensation
 which requires
the measurement of the cost of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair
value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized when the event occurs. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate
the fair value of options granted.

The
Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 &#34;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees&#34; (&#34;Topic No. 505-50&#34;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions
with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments
issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable.

Revenue
Recognition

It
is the company's policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 &#34;Revenue Recognition.&#34;
Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue earning activities are recognized upon the sale of its products. As of February 28
 2015
 the
Company has not generated any revenue.

Income
Taxes

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 &#34;Accounting for
Income Taxes.&#34; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for
the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized
in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight
of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized.

ASC
740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected
to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#34;more likely than not&#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination
based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge
of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a
current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain
tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.

Earning
(Loss) Per Share

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;ASC&#34;) 260

per Share
statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In
computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased
from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
As at February 28
 2015
 there&#160;are no dilutive potential common shares.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary and have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (&#34;U.S.&#160;GAAP&#34;). All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

The
Company has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10
 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination
of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the Company to remove the inception to date information
and all references to development stage.

Management
believes no other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have no impact on the financial statements of the Company.

Derivative
financial instruments

Derivative
financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value
at each reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognized assets
and liabilities ('fair value hedges'). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold
 terminated
or exercised
 no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Company chooses to end the hedging&#160;relationship.

Fair
Value Measurements

As
defined in ASC 820 &#34;Fair Value Measurements&#34;
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company
utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions
about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (level 3 measurement).

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are as follows:

Level
1 &#150; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities
and listed equities.

Level
2 &#150; Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation
methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward
prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout
the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions
are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity
swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.

Level
3 &#150; Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may
be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.

The
following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at February 29
 2016 and February 28
 2015
 measured at fair value
on a recurring basis:

The
Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
However
 the Company has negative working capital
 recurring losses
 and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient
to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described
in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

In
the coming year
 the Company's foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business
maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the payment of
expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to
raise additional capital.

Historically
it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operations and growth.
Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company's
stock or through loans from private investors
 although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing.
The Company's failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

We
did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because
we have experienced operating losses since inception. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through
future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax
asset
 consisting of net operating loss carry forwards
 because management has determined that it is more likely than not that
we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.

The
Company has not taken a tax position that
 if challenged
 would have a material effect on the financial statements for the years
ended February 2015 applicable under FASB ASC 740. We did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position
and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet. All tax returns
for the Company remain open.

The
provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences for the periods presented are as follows:

On
December 10
 2015
 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company issued a convertible
note in the amount of $170
000
 which included an original issue discount of $20
000
 for net proceeds to be provided of $150
000.
Pursuant to the terms of the note
 net proceeds of $45
000 upon closure of the agreement
 on which the Company recognized a pro-rated
OID of $15
000 in addition to the cash proceeds and two investor notes for $50
000 each. The debt is convertible upon effective
date of the note
 debt holder can convert into common stock at .30 unless market capitalization falls below $10M at any time in
which the conversion rate is reset to lower of conversion price and market price with a true-up provision. In addition to the
convertible note
 the Company granted to the same investor the right to purchase
 at anytime
 three five&#8722;year 100
000 fully
paid and non-assessable cashless warrants of Company's common stock. The exercise price of the cashless $0.30 unless
 while warrant
is outstanding
 the Company sells any common stock
 debt
 warrants
 options
 preferred shares or other instruments or securities
which are convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock
 at an effective price per share less than the exercise price
then such price shall become the exercise price.

The
Company identified conversion features embedded within convertible debt and warrants issued during 2015. The Company has determined
that the conversion feature of the Notes and warrants represents an embedded derivative since the Notes include a reset provision
which could cause adjustments upon conversion. Accordingly
 the Notes and warrants are not considered to be conventional debt
and the embedded conversion feature must be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability.

Therefore
the fair value of the derivative instruments have been recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet with the corresponding amount
recorded as discounts to the Notes. Such discounts will be accreted from the issuance date to the maturity date of the Notes.
The change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities will be recorded in other income or expenses in the statement of operations
at the end of each period
 with the offset to the derivative liabilities on the balance sheet. The fair value of the embedded
derivative liabilities was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the issuance dates and re-measured at balance
sheet date.

The
following table summarizes the changes in the derivative liabilities during the year ended February 28
 2016:&#160;

The
assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model referred to above are based upon the following data: (1) The expected life of the
derivative is estimated by considering the contractual term
 the vesting period and the expected exercise price. (2)&#160;The
expected stock price volatility of the underlying shares over the expected life is based upon historical share price data. (3)
The risk free interest rate is based on published U.S. Treasury Department interest rates for the expected life. (4) Expected
dividends are based on historical dividend data and expected future dividend activity.

As of February 29
 2016
 no principal
has been converted and the net outstanding balance is $10
663 after amortization of the OID $2
670 and amortization of derivative
discount of $7
993 recognized on the derivative liability. During 2016
 no notes payable were converted that resulted in settlement
of the related derivative liabilities.

 &#34;we&#34;
&#34;us&#34;
 &#34;our&#34;
 the &#34;Company&#34; or the &#34;Registrant&#34;) was originally incorporated in the State
of Colorado on March 26
 1990 under the name of Southshore Corporationand changed our name to Torrent Energy Corp. on July 15

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.




The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. A change in managements' estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on 1PM Industries financial condition and
results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Nate's
Food Co.'s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their
financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.




The
Company applies Topic 718 &#34;Share-Based Payments&#34; (&#34;Topic 718&#34;) to share-based compensation
 which requires
the measurement of the cost of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair
value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized when the event occurs. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate
the fair value of options granted.

The Company
accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 &#34;Equity-Based Payments
to Non-Employees&#34; (&#34;Topic No. 505-50&#34;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with
non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
whichever is more reliably measurable.




It
is the company's policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 &#34;Revenue Recognition.&#34;
Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue earning activities are recognized upon the sale of its products. As of February 28
 2015
 the
Company has not generated any revenue.




The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 &#34;Accounting for
Income Taxes.&#34; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for
the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized
in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight
of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized.

ASC 740-10
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken
may be recognized only if it is &#34;more likely than not&#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its
technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that
is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the
relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit
has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position.
Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.




The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;ASC&#34;) 260

per Share
statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In
computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased
from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
As at February 28
 2015
 there&#160;are no dilutive potential common shares.




The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary and have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (&#34;U.S.&#160;GAAP&#34;). All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.




The
Company has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10
 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination
of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the Company to remove the inception to date information
and all references to development stage.

Management
believes no other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have no impact on the financial statements of the Company.




Derivative
financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value
at each reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognized assets
and liabilities ('fair value hedges'). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold
 terminated
or exercised
 no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Company chooses to end the hedging&#160;relationship.




As
defined in ASC 820 &#34;Fair Value Measurements&#34;
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company
utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions
about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (level 3 measurement).

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are as follows:

Level
1 &#150; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities
and listed equities.

Level
2 &#150; Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation
methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward
prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout
the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions
are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity
swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.

Level
3 &#150; Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may
be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.

following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at February 29
 2016 and February 28
 2015
