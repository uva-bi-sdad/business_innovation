 Japan
 Inc. (HDJ) joint venture competes in the super-premium ice cream category
in Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar products

Our primary customers are grocery stores
 mass merchandisers
 membership stores
 natural food chains
 drug
 dollar and
discount chains
 retailers
 commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators
 restaurants
 convenience stores
 and pet specialty stores. We generally sell to these customers
through our direct sales force. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain products and to serve certain types of customers. For further information on our customer credit and product return practices
 please refer to Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2019
 Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 20&nbsp;percent of our consolidated net sales and 31&nbsp;percent of net sales of our North America Retail
segment. No other customer accounted for 10&nbsp;percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further information on significant customers

The packaged foods categories are highly competitive
 with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and
throughout the world. The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers
 as well as retailers with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products
 All of our principal competitors have substantial financial
 marketing
 and other
resources. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation
 product quality
 price
 brand recognition and loyalty
 effectiveness of marketing
 promotional activity
 convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer
 and the
ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights
 effective customer relationships
 superior product quality
 innovative advertising
 product
promotion
 product innovation aligned with consumers&#146; needs
 an efficient supply chain
 and price. In most product categories
 we compete not only with other widely advertised
 branded products
 but also with regional brands and with generic
and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally
 we compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers
 and each country includes a unique group of competitors. 
Raw materials
 ingredients
The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat
 oats
 and corn)
 dairy products
 sugar
fruits
 vegetable oils
 meats
 nuts
 vegetables
 and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board
 corrugated
 plastic and metal packaging materials
 operating supplies
 and energy. Most of these inputs for our
domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations
 inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may
fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather
 product scarcity
 limited sources of supply
 commodity market fluctuations
 currency fluctuations
 trade tariffs
 and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and
regulations. We have some long-term fixed price contracts
 but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible
 we make
advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit
margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products
 to the extent possible
 we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of risk management
strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides 
 






us efficient access to
 and more informed knowledge of
 various commodity markets
 principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net realizable value
and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.

 we could choose to do the same
 which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the
same
 our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new
product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality
 we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products.

 large retail customers
may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency
 lower pricing
 increased reliance on their own brand name products
 increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands
 and increased promotional
programs. If we are unable to use our scale
 marketing expertise
 product innovation
 knowledge of consumers&#146; needs
 and category leadership positions to respond to these demands
 our profitability and volume growth could be negatively
impacted. In addition
 the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2019
 Walmart accounted for 20&nbsp;percent of our consolidated net sales and 31&nbsp;percent of net sales of our North America Retail
segment. PetSmart and Petco accounted for 36&nbsp;percent and 14&nbsp;percent
 respectively
 of our Pet segment&#146;s net sales in fiscal 2019. National pet superstore chains have experienced reduced store traffic. If national pet superstore chains
continue to experience reduced store traffic
 or experience any operational difficulties
 our Pet segment operating results may be adversely affected. For more information on significant customers
 please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials
 packaging
 and energy may adversely affect our
The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as
weather
 product scarcity
 limited sources of supply
 commodity market fluctuations
 currency fluctuations
 trade tariffs
 and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected
increases in raw material
 packaging
 and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices
 we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in
commodity prices
Volatility in the market value of derivatives we
We utilize derivatives to
manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs
 including grains (oats
 wheat
 and corn)
 oils (principally soybean)
 dairy products
 natural gas
 and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in
earnings currently
 resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating
results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process
 at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile

 our profitability could suffer as a result of the
Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the
production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more 
 






difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability
and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production
 which may negatively
impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned
 we may not realize all or any
of the anticipated benefits
Disruption of our supply chain could adversely
Our ability to make

manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather
 including any potential effects of climate change
 natural disaster
 fire
 terrorism
 cyber-attack
 pandemic
 strikes
 import/export restrictions
 or other factors could impair our ability
to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location. Our suppliers&#146; policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Failure to take adequate steps to
mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events
 or to effectively manage such events if they occur
 particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location
 could adversely affect our business and results of operations
Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to
We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and
quality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns
 whether or not valid
 may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. 
If our products become adulterated
 misbranded
 or mislabeled
 we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers
We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated
 misbranded
 or mislabeled. A widespread product
recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall
 the destruction of product inventory
 and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability
judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity
 damage to our reputation
 and a loss of consumer confidence in our products
 which could have an adverse effect on our business
We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends
 which may result in decreased demand
Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes
 eating habits
 and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to
offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to
anticipate
 identify or react to these changes and trends
 channels
 or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis
 we may experience reduced demand for
our products
 which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly
 demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium
 trans fats
 genetically modified
organisms
 sugar
 processed wheat
 or other product ingredients or attributes. 
 





We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable
The food industry&#146;s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our
business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also
depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories
 our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. 


 consumers may purchase
more generic
 private label
 and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances
 we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In
addition
 as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions
 we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase
products from our Convenience Stores&nbsp;&amp; Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 


large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors
 including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner
 adverse
publicity about our products
 our failure to maintain the quality of our products
 the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences
 concerns about food safety
 or our products becoming unavailable to consumers.
Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by consumers
 us
 and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or
misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us
 our brands
 or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands
our business results could be negatively impacted. 

 26&nbsp;percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks

 we had total debt

 and noncontrolling interests of $15.4&nbsp;billion. The agreements under

 or general corporate
purposes

flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our
operating and financial performance

Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity
 increase our costs of
borrowing
We depend on stable
 liquid
 and well-functioning capital and credit markets to
fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows
 financial assets
 access to capital and credit markets
 and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future
 there can be no
assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are
not effective in hedging this volatility
 we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets
From time to time
 we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (IBORs) and enter into
interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an IBOR. There is currently uncertainty whether certain IBORs will continue to be available after 2021. If certain IBORs cease to be available
 we may need to amend affected agreements
and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. As a result
 our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.
Volatility in the securities markets
 interest rates
 and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States
 Canada
 and various
foreign locations
 including defined benefit pension
 retiree health and welfare
 severance
 and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of
securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates
 mortality rates
 health care costs
 early retirement rates
 investment returns
 and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause
volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from
operations.

A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different
weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. 

 2019
 we had $20.6&nbsp;billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for
impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of
the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit
 including goodwill
 impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are
determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates
 perpetuity growth assumptions
 market comparables
 and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced
declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired
 different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment

Our ability to realize the
anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition will depend
 to a large extent
 on our ability to integrate Blue Buffalo

In addition
 the integration of Blue Buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems

 even if Blue Buffalo is integrated successfully
the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized
 including the synergies
 cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame
 or at all.

 additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition. As a result

The $550&nbsp;million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $413&nbsp;million change in the timing of accounts payable
 including the impact of longer payment terms implemented in prior fiscal years. The change in

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals
 as appropriate. 
Goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets

 other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry
 known
technological advances
 legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment
 and expected changes in distribution channels)
 the level of required maintenance expenditures
 and the expected lives of other related
groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis
 over their useful lives
 generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a
discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan
 assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands
 and a discount rate.

 we had $20.6&nbsp;billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each
intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows
 materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of
capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2019 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As a result of lower sales projections in our

 we make various
assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit
expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets
 the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans
 and health care cost trend rates. 
Our expected rate
of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation
 our historical long-term investment performance
 our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries
 investment services
 and investment managers)
and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase
our net pension and postretirement expense by $70&nbsp;million for fiscal 2020. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce 
 






 expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a
five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related
value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income.

Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May&nbsp;31 for our defined benefit pension

of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and
 using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield
 to develop a forward interest rate curve
 including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is
applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately $55&nbsp;million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan
participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as &#147;all or almost all&#148; inactive participants. 
We review our health care
cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience
 plan design
 overall industry experience and
projections
 and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review
 recent experiences
 and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost
trend rate assumption is 6.7&nbsp;percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4&nbsp;percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2019. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5&nbsp;percent is reached in 2029 for
all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees&#146; benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually
 as necessary
 to approximate the current economic view on
the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

 experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the
plan is viewed as &#147;all or almost all&#148; inactive participants. 

 we recorded net defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plan expense of $24&nbsp;million compared to
$23&nbsp;million of expense in fiscal 2018 and $56&nbsp;million of expense in fiscal 2017. As of May&nbsp;26
 2019
 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2.0&nbsp;billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative
unrecognized actuarial net gains of $81&nbsp;million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans
 mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates
 partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets.
These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP.

In August
2017
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new hedge accounting requirements. The new standard amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entity&#146;s risk management activities and
financial reporting. The new standard also simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15

 the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting
 presentation and classification of leases. This will result in certain leases
being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15
 2018
and interim periods within those annual periods
 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments allow for either the modified retrospective transition approach

application of the guidance in all comparative periods presented
 or the cumulative effect adjustment approach
 which requires application of the guidance at the adoption date. 

 developing a centralized business process
 and implementing corresponding controls. We have
substantially completed our analysis of the impact of this standard on our lease portfolio. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach and electing certain practical expedients
permitted under the transition guidance
 including not reassessing whether existing contracts contain leases and carrying forward the historical 
 






classification of those leases. In addition
 we will also elect to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not expect the effects
to the Consolidated Financial Statements to be pervasive. We estimate that we will record right of use assets and related liabilities of approximately $400 to $500&nbsp;million
 subject to the completion of our assessment and the fluctuation of our
lease portfolio and discount rates. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings or our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of

cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business
 we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions
 authorized under established policies that place clear controls
on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial
instruments. For information on interest rate

The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates
 and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the
 data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in
fair value that we expect to incur. Further
 since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure
 we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an
increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps
 futures
 and options; and equity instruments. The
calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

NOTE 1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS 

 Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest.
Intercompany transactions and accounts
 including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests&#146; share of those transactions
 are eliminated in consolidation. 
Certain
reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 2 for additional information. 
As part of a long-term
plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations


 in fiscal 2017
 our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact
of these changes was not material to our consolidated results of operations. Our General Mills India business and Pet operating segment are on an April fiscal year end. 

We consider all
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

 with all net changes in value recorded in earnings
Inventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost

is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment
 including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs

 primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance
and repairs are charged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 years
 and equipment
 furniture
 and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until
disposal. When an item is sold or retired
 the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses
 if any
 are recognized in earnings. As of May&nbsp;26

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
(or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups
have identifiable cash flows and are largely 
 






independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a
discounted cash flow model or independent appraisals
 as appropriate. 

occurred. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of the first day of the second quarter of the fiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying
value of a reporting unit
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit
 which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items
among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 impairment has occurred. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the
total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also
make estimates of discount rates
 perpetuity growth assumptions
 market comparables
We evaluate the useful lives of our other
intangible assets
 mainly brands
 to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence
 demand
 competition
 other
economic factors (such as the stability of the industry
 known technological advances
 legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment
 and expected changes in distribution channels)
 the level of required
maintenance expenditures
 and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis
 over their useful lives
 generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. 

 mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the 

 

 


 
 brands
 are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan
 assumed royalty
rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands
Our finite-lived intangible assets
 primarily acquired franchise
agreements and customer relationships
 are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted
future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would be
based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model
 as appropriate. 
Our
investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures
 incur various expenses (primarily
research and development)
 and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition
 we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw
materials
 semi-finished goods
 and finished goods to the joint ventures
In addition
 we assess our investments in our joint
ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including
 but not limited to
 as a result of ongoing operating losses
 projected decreases in earnings
 increases in the weighted-average cost of capital
 or significant business
disruptions. The significant assumptions 
 






used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability
 royalty rates
 capital spending
 depreciation and taxes
 foreign currency exchange rates
 and a discount rate. By their
nature
 these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment
 then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent
nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary. 

 a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49&nbsp;percent
interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year
 up to three times before December 2024. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal&#146;s interest as a
redeemable interest outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable
 the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our
 capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest&#146;s redemption value
which approximates its fair value. During the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019
 we adjusted the redeemable interest&#146;s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption
value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan
 capital spending
 depreciation
 taxes
 foreign currency exchange rates
 and a discount rate. 
Our revenues primarily result
from contracts with customers
 which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation &#150; the delivery of product. We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation has been
satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer
 which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable
consideration and consideration payable to our customers
 including trade promotion

other excise taxes are not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated expenses and actual
costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return. However

 we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances
 product returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest. Payment terms and
collection patterns are short-term

 and as such
 we do not have any significant financing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable
 and credit losses in our existing receivables
 as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we
deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 16 for a disaggregation of our revenue into categories that depict how the nature

future and foreign exchange gains and losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. 
All derivatives are
recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value
 and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values
of derivatives are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income
 based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and
 if so
 the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments
reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist
 any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any

 the related compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for

 if less than the stated vesting period.

circumstances
 we also provide accruable benefits
 primarily severance
 to former or inactive employees in the United States

 and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service.
Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. 
 






In fiscal 2018
 we approved an amendment to reorganize
the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan
(Grandfathered) (together
 the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May&nbsp;31
 2018. The benefits offered to the plans&#146; participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I
(Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together
 the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide
additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service period of the active participants.

 we adopted new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense
 net
periodic postretirement benefit expense
 and net periodic postemployment benefit expense (collectively &#147;net periodic benefit expense&#148;). The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in
the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. In addition
 the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. The new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit
expense and prospective application of the capitalization of the service cost component. The impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations was a decrease to our operating profit of $87.9&nbsp;million
 $89.4&nbsp;million and
 income of $87.9&nbsp;million
 $89.4&nbsp;million and $74.3&nbsp;million for fiscal 2019
 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017
 respectively.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019
 we adopted new accounting requirements for the
recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new standard
 we apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised goods to customers and in an amount that reflects the
consideration for which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The principles-based five step model includes: 1) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; 3)
determining the transaction price; 4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognizing revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We utilized a comprehensive approach to evaluate and
document the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices. We did not identify any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. Additionally
 we did not identify any
significant changes to our business processes
 systems
 and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments to all contracts in the first
quarter of fiscal 2019 using the cumulative effect approach. 
 






We recorded a $33.9&nbsp;million cumulative effect adjustment net of income tax effects to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings
 a decrease to deferred income taxes of
$11.4&nbsp;million
 and an increase to other current liabilities of $45.3&nbsp;million related to the timing of recognition of certain promotional expenditures. 

 we adopted new accounting requirements that codify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin
No.&nbsp;118
 as it relates to allowing for recognition of provisional amounts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the event that the accounting is not complete and a reasonable estimate can be made. Where necessary information is
not available
 prepared
 or analyzed to determine a reasonable estimate
 no provisional amount should be recorded. The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting related to the TCJA.
In fiscal 2019
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018
 we adopted new accounting requirements
that provide the option to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4&nbsp;million from AOCI to retained earnings.
This reclassification consisted of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceeded the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The new accounting requirements allowed for adjustments to reclassification amounts in subsequent periods as a
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 we adopted new requirements for the accounting and
presentation of stock-based payments. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the prospective recognition of realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards in our Consolidated Statements of
 within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of realized windfall tax benefits
 which
resulted in reclassifications of cash provided by financing activities to operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally
 we retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of employee tax
withholdings
 which resulted in reclassifications of cash used by operating activities to financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Stock-based compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures. 

 we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities to measure a goodwill impairment loss by the
amount by which a reporting unit&#146;s carrying value exceeds the reporting unit&#146;s fair value. Previously
 goodwill impairment losses were required to be measured by determining the implied fair value of goodwill. Our annual goodwill
impairment test was performed as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2018
 and the adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position. 

 we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value
 providing a
practical expedient to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. We adopted the guidance retrospectively and restated the fiscal 2016 fair value of plan asset tables in Note 13. The

RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES
We view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate of
return and net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs)
 the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or
reduced depreciation. These activities result in various restructuring costs
 including asset write-offs
 exit charges including severance
 contract termination fees
 and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with
restructured assets
 as used in the context of our disclosures regarding restructuring activity
 refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to
coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. Any impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved.

 RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
 AND FAIR VALUES 
The carrying values of cash and

 and notes payable approximate fair value. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. As of May&nbsp;26
 2019 and May&nbsp;27

 a comparison of cost and market
values of our marketable debt and equity securities is as follows: 









































































































































































































































There were no realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018
 we realized
 marketable securities. Gains and losses are determined by specific identification. Classification of
marketable securities as current or noncurrent is dependent upon our intended holding period and the security&#146;s maturity date. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on
 debt securities
 net of tax effects
 are classified in AOCI within stockholders&#146; equity. 























































As of May&nbsp;26
 2019
 we had $2.3&nbsp;million of certain marketable debt securities pledged as collateral for derivative
contracts. As of May&nbsp;26

272.8&nbsp;million and $13
021.3&nbsp;million
 respectively
 as
of May&nbsp;26
 2019. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using market quotations and discounted cash flows based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. Long-term debt is a Level&nbsp;2 liability in
the fair value hierarchy. 

 we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity and equity
prices. To manage these risks
 we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g.
 futures
 options
 and swaps) pursuant to our established policies. 
Many commodities we use in the
production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs
 including grains (oats
 wheat
 and corn)
 oils (principally soybean)
 dairy
products
 natural gas
 and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of 
 






commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders
 long-term contracts with suppliers
 exchange-traded futures and options


We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve
hedge accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly
 the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

 we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providing
certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly
 for purposes of measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating
results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit
 allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of
 volatility
 which remains in unallocated corporate items.

Net gain (loss) on














Net loss on commodity positions reclassified from unallocated corporate items to segment

As of May&nbsp;26
 2019
 the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $312.5&nbsp;million
 of which $242.9&nbsp;million
related to agricultural inputs and $69.6&nbsp;million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months. 
We are exposed to interest rate
volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt
 and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates
 LIBOR
 Euribor
 and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use
interest rate swaps
 forward-starting interest rate swaps
 and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes
 to reduce the volatility of our financing costs
 and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed rate versus floating-rate
debt
 based on current and projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps
 we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.
 interest rate
swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges
 as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments on
the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains and losses are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than

interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a $2.4&nbsp;million gain in fiscal 2019

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the
major credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade
 the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of
all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on May&nbsp;26
 2019
 was $7.4&nbsp;million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent features
underlying these agreements had been triggered on May&nbsp;26

 we would have been required to post $7.4&nbsp;million of collateral to counterparties.

We have defined benefit
pension plans covering many employees in the United States
 Canada
 Switzerland
 France
 and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include
various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2019 or 2018. We do not expect to be
required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five
years of a change in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June&nbsp;1
 2013
 are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan. 

 we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in
the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan (Grandfathered) (together
 the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May&nbsp;31
 2018. The
benefits offered to the plans&#146; participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I
(Grandfathered) (together
 the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains
and losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over
the average remaining life of the participants.

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims

 overall industry experience and projections
 and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend
rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review

 and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.7&nbsp;percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4&nbsp;percent for
retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2019. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5&nbsp;percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees&#146;
benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually
 as necessary

spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May&nbsp;31 for our defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May&nbsp;31 to determine defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work
with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and
 using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield
 to develop a forward interest rate curve
 including a margin to that index based
on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

on the fair value of the underlying investments and contract fair values established by the providers. 



Primarily private investments
 insurance contracts
 and common collective trusts that are measured at fair value
using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. 



Plan assets and obligations are measured as of May&nbsp;31
 2019
 and May&nbsp;31
 2018. 
 





 
Our expected rate
of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation
 our historical long-term investment performance
 our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries
 investment services
 and investment managers)
and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however
 our annual investment performance for one particular year does not
 by itself
 significantly influence our evaluation. 

















































































































































































The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit
obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly
diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes
 the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the U.S. defined benefit pension plans
 the long-term investment policy allocation is:
18&nbsp;percent to equities in the United States; 11&nbsp;percent to international equities; 9&nbsp;percent to private equities; 48&nbsp;percent to fixed income; and 14&nbsp;percent to real assets (real estate
 energy
 and infrastructure). For other
U.S. postretirement benefit plans
 the long-term investment policy allocations are: 18&nbsp;percent to equities in the United States; 10&nbsp;percent to international equities; 4&nbsp;percent to private equities; 65&nbsp;percent to fixed income; and
3&nbsp;percent to real assets (real estate
 energy
 and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

On December&nbsp;22

 the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA results in significant revisions to the U.S. corporate
income tax system
 including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate
 implementation of a territorial system
 repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings. As a result
of the TCJA
 we recorded a provisional benefit of $523.5&nbsp;million during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019
 we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7.2&nbsp;million which included adjustments to the
transition tax and the measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJA is deemed to be complete
 these amounts were based on prevailing regulations and currently available information
 and
The legislation also
includes provisions that affected our fiscal 2019 results
 including but not limited to
 a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic operations; the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision
that taxes U.S. allocated expenses as well as currently taxes certain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction;
While the new legislation generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on
dividends from foreign subsidiaries going forward
 certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries must be included currently in our U.S. taxable income under the new GILTI inclusion rules.&nbsp;Under U.S. GAAP
 we are allowed to make an accounting
policy election and record the taxes as a period cost as incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes.&nbsp;In fiscal 2018
 we made an accounting policy election to record these taxes as a period cost.

operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely

 local
 and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final

 we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities

Several state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations
to result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. During fiscal 2018

Approximately $81.2&nbsp;million of this total in fiscal 2019 represents the amount that

 2020
 the 2023 Notes will mature on April&nbsp;27
 2023
 and
the 2027 Notes will mature on April&nbsp;27
 2027. We will pay interest on the 2020 Notes at the rate of 2.100% per year annually in arrears on November&nbsp;16 of each year to holders of record on the preceding November 1. We will pay interest on
the 2023 Notes at the rate of 1.000% per year annually in arrears on April&nbsp;27 of each year
 beginning April&nbsp;27
 2016
 to holders of record on the preceding April 12. We will pay interest on the 2027 Notes at the rate of 1.500% per year
annually in arrears on April&nbsp;27 of each year
 beginning April&nbsp;27
 2016
 to holders of record on the preceding April 12. Interest payments for the 2020 Notes include accrued interest from and including November&nbsp;15
 2013 or from and
including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for
 as the case may be
 to but excluding the interest payment date or the date of maturity
 as the case may be. Interest payments for the 2023 and 2027 Notes include
accrued interest from and including April&nbsp;27
 2015 or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for
 as the case may be
 to but excluding the next interest payment date or the date of maturity

the case may be. Interest payable at the maturity of the 2020
 2023 and 2027 Notes will be payable to the registered holders of the 2020
 2023 and 2027 Notes to whom the principal is payable. 

 2023 and 2027 Notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being
calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the 2020
 2023 and 2027 Notes
 to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL
(ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association. If any interest payment date on the 2020
 2023 or 2027 Notes falls on a day that is not a business day
 the interest payment will be postponed to the next day that is
a business day
 and no interest on that payment will accrue for the period from and after the interest payment date. If the maturity date of the 2020
 2023 or 2027 Notes falls on a day that is not a business day
 the payment of interest and
principal will be made on the next succeeding business day
 and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the maturity date.

 that interest payable on the maturity date or any redemption date shall be payable to the person to whom the principal of such Floating Rate Notes shall be payable. 

 the
interest payment date will be postponed to the next succeeding business day and interest will accrue to but excluding such interest payment date
 except that if such business day falls in the next succeeding calendar month
 the applicable interest
payment date will be the immediately preceding business day. If the maturity date or any earlier redemption date of the Floating Rate Notes falls on a day that is not a business day
 the payment of principal

 if any

 if any
otherwise payable on such date will be postponed to the next succeeding business day

 except that if the next succeeding business day falls in the next
succeeding calendar month
The initial interest period
was the period from and including January&nbsp;15
 2016 to but excluding the first interest reset date. The interest rate in effect during the initial interest period was equal to EURIBOR plus 73 basis points (0.73%)
 determined two TARGET system
days prior to January&nbsp;15
 2016. A &#147;TARGET system day&#148; is any day in which the TARGET2 System
 or any successor thereto
 is open for business and a day on which commercial banks are open for dealings in euro deposits in the London
interbank market. With respect to Floating Rate Notes in certificated form
 the reference to business day will also mean a day on which banking institutions generally are open for business in the location of each office of a transfer agent
 but only
After the initial interest period
 the interest periods are the
periods from and including an interest reset date to but excluding the immediately succeeding interest reset date
 except that the final interest period will be the period from and including the interest reset date immediately preceding the maturity
date to but excluding the maturity date (each an &#147;interest period&#148;). The interest rate per annum for the Floating Rate Notes in any interest period will be equal to EURIBOR plus 73 basis points (0.73%) (the &#147;interest rate&#148;)
 as
determined by the calculation agent. The interest rate in effect for the 15 calendar days prior to any redemption date earlier than the maturity date will be the interest rate in effect on the fifteenth day preceding such earlier redemption date.
The interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes is limited to the maximum rate permitted by New York law
 as the same may be modified by
United States law of general application
Upon the request of any holder of Floating Rate Notes
 the
calculation agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and
 if determined
 the interest rate that will become effective on the next interest reset date. 

&#147;EURIBOR&#148; with respect to any interest determination date will be the
offered rate for deposits of euros having a maturity of three months that appears on &#147;Reuters Page EURIBOR 01&#148; at approximately 11:00 a.m.
 Brussels time
 on such interest determination date. If on an interest determination date
 such rate
does not appear on the &#147;Reuters Page EURIBOR 01&#148; as of 11:00 a.m.
 Brussels time
 or if &#147;Reuters Page EURIBOR 01&#148; is not available on such date
 the calculation agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.&#146;s page
&#147;BBAM.&#148; If no offered rate appears on &#147;Reuters Page EURIBOR 01&#148; or Bloomberg L.P.&#146;s page &#147;BBAM&#148; on an interest determination date
 EURIBOR will be determined for such interest determination date on the basis of the
rates at approximately 11:00 a.m.
 Brussels time
 on such interest determination date at which deposits in euros are offered to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market by the principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in such
market selected and identified by us (the &#147;reference banks&#148;)
 for a term of three months commencing on the applicable interest reset date and in a principal amount of not less than &#128;1
000
000 that is representative for a single
transaction in euros in such market at such time. We will ensure the calculation agent is 





provided with the complete contact details of the relevant personnel at each of the reference banks that they will be required to contact in order to obtain the relevant interest rate. The
calculation agent will request the principal euro-zone office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided
 EURIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards) of
such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are provided
 EURIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards) of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m.
 Brussels time
 on such interest determination date by
three major banks in the euro-zone
 selected and identified by us
 for loans in euros to leading European banks
 for a term of three months
 commencing on the applicable interest reset date and in a principal amount of not less than &#128;1
000
000
that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such time; provided
 however
 that if the banks so selected are not quoting as mentioned above
 the then-existing EURIBOR rate will remain in effect for such interest period
 or
 if
none
All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate for the
Floating Rate Notes are rounded
 if necessary
 to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point
 of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g.
 9.876545% (or .09876545) would
be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655))
 and all euro amounts are rounded to the nearest cent
 cent being rounded upward. The amount of interest payable in respect of each note is calculated by
applying the applicable interest rate for such interest period to the outstanding principal amount of such Floating Rate Notes
 multiplying the product by the actual number of days in such interest period and dividing by 360. Each calculation of the
interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes by the calculation agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on us
 the trustee and the holders of the Floating Rate Notes. 
All
payments of interest and principal
 including payments made upon any redemption of the Notes
 is payable in euro. If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is
no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community
 then all
payments in respect of the Notes will be made in dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. The amount payable on any date in euro is converted into dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euro.
Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture governing the Notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or
conversion in connection with the foregoing. 

 without the consent of the holders of Notes
 issue additional Notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate
 maturity and
other terms as a series of the Notes (except for the public offering price and issue date and
 in some cases
 the first interest payment date). Any additional Notes
 together with the Notes with the same terms
 will constitute a single series of
Notes under the Indenture; provided that
 if the additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes in this offering for United States federal income tax purposes
 the additional Notes will have different ISIN and CUSIP numbers. No additional Notes of
a series may be issued if an event of default has occurred with respect to that series of Notes. 

unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Notes effectively rank junior to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such indebtedness. In addition
 because the Notes are only our obligation and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries
 creditors of each of our subsidiaries
 including trade creditors and owners of preferred equity of our subsidiaries
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of our creditors
 including holders of the Notes. The Notes
 therefore
 are effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors
 including trade
creditors
 of our subsidiaries
 and to claims of owners of preferred equity of our subsidiaries. 

As discussed below
 we may redeem the 2020
 2023 and 2027 Notes before they mature. The 2020
 2023 and 2027 Notes to be
redeemed will stop bearing interest on the redemption date. We will give holders of 2020
 2023 or 2027 Notes between 15 and 45 days&#146; notice before the redemption date.

test

Default and Related Matters
Noteholders will have special rights if an event of default occurs and is not cured. For each series of Notes the term &#147;event of
default&#148; means any of the following: 



















we do not deposit money into a separate custodial account
 known as a sinking fund
 when such a deposit is due
if we agree to maintain a sinking fund with respect to that series; 





we remain in breach of any restrictive covenant with respect to that series or any other term of the Indenture
for 60 days after we receive a notice of default stating we are in breach (the notice must be sent by either the trustee or direct holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of Notes of the affected series); or 






we file for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy
 insolvency or reorganization occur. 

 insolvency or other similar proceeding
 all of the Notes will automatically be due and immediately payable. If
 event of default has occurred with respect to any series of Notes and has not been cured
 the trustee or the direct holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes of the
affected series may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes of that series to be due and immediately payable. This is called a &#147;declaration of acceleration of maturity.&#148; 

affected series if any other defaults on those Notes have been waived or cured and we pay or deposit with the trustee an amount sufficient to pay the following with respect to the Notes of that series: 












principal and premium
 if any
 which has become due
 other than as a result of the acceleration
 plus any
interest on that principal; 





interest on overdue interest
 to the extent that payment is lawful; and 








 where the trustee has some special duties
 the trustee is not required to take any action under the Indenture at
the request of any direct holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability
 called an &#147;indemnity.&#148; If reasonable indemnity is provided
 the direct holders of a majority in principal amount of
the outstanding Notes of the relevant series may direct the time
 method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. These majority direct holders may also direct the trustee in
Before an investor may bypass the trustee and bring its own
lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce its rights or protect its interests relating to any Notes of any series
 the following must occur: 





the investor must give the trustee written notice that an event of default with respect to the Notes of that
series has occurred and remains uncured; 









the direct holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding Notes of that series must make a
written request that the trustee take action because of the default
 and must offer reasonable indemnity to the trustee against any cost and liabilities of taking that action; 






the trustee must not have received from direct holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
of that series a direction inconsistent with the written notice; and 





the trustee must have failed to take action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity.
However
 investors are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on a Note on or after its

 we may elect to discharge
our obligations on the 2020
 2023 and 2027 Notes through defeasance or covenant defeasance. 

 we could legally release ourselves from any payment or other
obligations on the 2020
 2023 or 2027 Notes
 called &#147;full defeasance
&#148; if we put in place the following arrangements for investors to be repaid: 





we must irrevocably deposit in trust for the benefit of all direct holders of those Notes money or specified
German government securities or a combination of these that will generate enough cash to make interest
 principal and any other payments on those Notes on their various due dates; 






there must be a change in current federal tax law or an Internal Revenue Service ruling that lets us make the
deposit without causing investors to be taxed on the Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit and simply repaid such Notes ourselves (under current United States federal tax law
 the deposit and our legal release from the such Notes
would be treated as though we took back such Notes and gave investors their share of the cash and notes or bonds deposited in trust
 in which case investors could recognize gain or loss on those Notes); and 






we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming the United States tax law change described above.
In addition
 no default must have occurred and be continuing with respect to those Notes at the time the deposit is
made (and
 with respect only to bankruptcy and similar events
 during the 90 days following the deposit)
 and we have delivered a certificate and a legal opinion to the effect that the deposit does not: 













cause the trustee to have a &#147;conflicting interest&#148; within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of
1939; 





result in a breach or violation of
 or constitute a default under
 any other agreement or instrument to which we
are party or by which we are bound; and 





result in the trust arising from it constituting an &#147;investment company&#148; within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (unless we register the trust
 or find an exemption from registration
 under that Act). 

 investors would have to rely solely on the trust deposit
 and could no longer look to us
 for
repayment on the Notes of the affected series. Conversely
 the trust deposit would likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever become bankrupt or insolvent. 


 we can make the same type of deposit described above and be released from many of the covenants in
the 2020
 2023 or 2027 Notes. This is called &#147;covenant defeasance.&#148; In that event
 investors would lose the 





protection of those covenants but would gain the protection of having money and securities set aside in trust to repay the applicable series of Notes. In order to achieve covenant defeasance
 we
must do the following: 





make the same deposit of money and/or German government securities described above under &#147;&#151; Full
Defeasance;&#148; 





deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming that under current United States federal income tax law we may
make the above deposit without causing investors to be taxed on the applicable series of Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit and simply repaid the applicable series of Notes ourselves; and 






comply with the other conditions precedent described above under &#147;&#151; Full Defeasance.&#148;
If we accomplish covenant defeasance
 the following provisions
 among others
 would no longer apply: 






the events of default relating to breach of covenants described below under &#147;Default and Related
Matters;&#148; and 





any promises regarding conduct of our business
 such as those described under &#147;Certain Restrictive
If we accomplish covenant defeasance
investors can still look to us for repayment of the applicable series of Notes if there is a shortfall in the trust deposit. Depending on the event causing the default
 however
 investors may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall. 



 there are changes that cannot be made to the Notes without specific investor approval. These include: 













reduction in the principal amount of
 the rate of interest payable on or any premium payable upon redemption of a
series of Notes; 





reduction in the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of a series of Notes following a
default; 












impairment of an investor&#146;s right to sue for payment on a series of Notes on or after the due date for such
payment; 





reduction in the percentage of direct holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required to modify or amend
the Indenture; 





reduction in the percentage of holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required under the Indenture to
waive compliance with provisions of
 or to waive defaults under
 the Indenture; and 





modification of any of the provisions described above or other provisions of the Indenture dealing with waiver of
defaults or covenants under the Indenture
 except to increase the percentages required for such waivers or to provide that other provisions of the Indenture cannot be changed without the consent of each direct holder affected by the change.
Second
 changes may be made by us and the trustee without any vote by holders of any series of Notes. These include:






evidencing the assumption by a successor of our obligations under the Indenture and any series of Notes;






adding to our covenants for the benefit of the holders of any series of Notes
 or surrendering any of our rights
or powers under the Indenture; 












making such changes as may be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of any series of Notes in bearer or
uncertificated form; 























curing any ambiguity
 correcting any Indenture provision that may be defective or inconsistent with other
Indenture provisions or making any other change that does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of any series of Notes in any material respect. 

 we need a vote by direct holders of Notes owning at least a majority of the principal amount of each series affected by the change to
make any other change to the Indenture that is not of the type described in the preceding two paragraphs. A majority vote of this kind is also required to obtain a waiver of any past default
 except a payment default on principal or interest or

 for purposes of measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the e&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;' &gt;xposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit

 forward-starting interest rate swaps

 and to achieve a desired proportio&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;' &gt;n of fixed rate versus floating-rate debt

Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs

We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly
Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting
ce of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly
xposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit

 which remains in unallocated corporate items.

We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt
 and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates

 rates in the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps
 forward-starting interest rate swaps
 and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes
 to reduce the volatility of our financing costs
n of fixed rate versus floating-rate debt
 based on current and projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps
Floating Interest Rate Exposures &#8212; Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges
 as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative met

Accumulated gain (loss) on foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Includes foreign currency transactions designated as hedges of net investment in a foreign entity and intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term nature
 when the entities to the transaction are consolidated
 combined
 or accounted for by the equity method in the reporting enterprise's financial statements. Includes the gain or loss on a derivative instrument or nonderivative financial instrument that may give rise to a foreign currency transaction gain or loss under FAS 52 and that have been designated and have qualified as hedging instruments for hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
















































































































































This item represents the difference between the gross realized gains and losses realized on the sale of debt or equity securities categorized neither as held-to-maturity nor trading securities. Additionally
 this item would include any losses recognized for other than temporary impairments (OTTI) of the subject investments in debt and equity securities.




























Maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that
 based on the gross fair value of the financial instrument
 the entity would incur if parties to the financial instruments that make up the concentration failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts and the collateral or other security
 if any
 for the amount due proved to be of no value to the entity.




























Contractual interest rate for funds borrowed
 under the debt agreement.




























Date when the debt instrument is scheduled to be fully repaid
 in CCYY-MM-DD format.

 in CCYY-MM-DD format.




























The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments that contain credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at the end of the reporting period. For nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments
 the fair value amounts are the carrying value of the nonderivative hedging instrument
 including the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain (loss) on that instrument.





































































































































































































































Maximum period of time the entity is hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year

 which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility
 employee exercise behavior
 dividend yield
 and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option
 excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered
 but did not use
 implied volatility in our estimate
 because trading activity in options on our stock
 especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months
 is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.
















Share-based Compensation
 Allocation and Classification in Financial Statements [Abstract]


























Unrecognized compensation expense on non-vested awards
 weighted average period of recognition










































































































































Represents the expense recognized during the period arising from equity-based compensation arrangements (for example
 shares of stock
 unit
 stock options or other equity instruments) with employees
 directors and certain consultants qualifying for treatment as emmployees
 including any applicable restructuring items and non-cash items.




























Period over which the company must achieve target performance goals in order for an employee to receive an equity-based payment award
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.






















































































Weighted average period over which unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized for equity-based compensation plans
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.





















































































Period which an employee's right to exercise an award is no longer contingent on satisfaction of either a service condition
 market condition or a performance condition
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.




























Fair value of share-based awards for which the grantee gained the right by satisfying service and performance requirements
 to receive or retain shares or units
 other instruments
 or cash.




























For each plan
 identification of the award pricing model or other valuation method used in calculating the weighted average fair values disclosed. The model is also used to calculate the compensation expense that is shown within the balance sheet
 income statement
 and cash flow. Examples of valuation techniques are lattice models (binomial model)
 closed-form models (Black-Scholes-Merton formula)
 and a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Fair value is the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties
 that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale. May include disclosures about the assumptions underlying application of the method selected.

























































The difference between the maximum number of shares (or other type of equity) authorized for issuance under the plan (including the effects of amendments and adjustments)
 and the sum of: 1) the number of shares (or other type of equity) already issued upon exercise of options or other equity-based awards under the plan; and 2) shares (or other type of equity) reserved for issuance on granting of outstanding awards
 net of cancellations and forfeitures
 if applicable.




























Period from grant date that an equity-based award expires
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
