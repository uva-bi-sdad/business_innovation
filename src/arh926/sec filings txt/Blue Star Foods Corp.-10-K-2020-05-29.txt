As
result of the global outbreak of the COVID-19 virus
 certain &ldquo;stay at home&rdquo; orders and other restrictions imposed

 Company management as well as professional staff and consultants have been hindered and
delayed in conducting the work required to prepare the financial statements for the Annual Report. This has
 in turn
 impacted
the Company&rsquo;s ability to compile and review certain information required to complete its audit and file this Annual Report
by its original due date
 March 30
 2020.

PART
I

ITEM
1. BUSINESS



We
were incorporated on October 17
 2017 in the State of Delaware as a blank check company to be used as a vehicle to pursue a business
combination with an unidentified target. Prior to the Merger (as defined below)
 we engaged in organizational efforts. Following
the Merger
 we discontinued our prior activities of seeking a business for a merger or acquisition. In connection with the Merger
the Company changed its name from &ldquo;AG Acquisition Group II
 Inc.&rdquo; to &ldquo;Blue Star Foods Corp.&rdquo; and succeeded
to the business of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.
 d/b/a Blue Star Foods
 a Florida corporation formed on May 5
 1995 (&ldquo; Keeler
&amp; Co.&rdquo;)
 an international seafood company that imports
 packages and sells refrigerated pasteurized crab meat
 and other
premium seafood products
 including crab cakes
 finfish and wakami salad
 as its sole line of business.



On
November 8
 2018 (the &ldquo;Closing Date&rdquo;)
 we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &ldquo;Merger
Agreement&rdquo;)
 with Keeler &amp; Co.
 Blue Star Acquisition Corp.
 our newly formed
 wholly-owned Florida subsidiary (&ldquo;Acquisition
Sub&rdquo;)
 and John Keeler
 Keeler &amp; Co&rsquo;s sole stockholder (the &ldquo;Sole Stockholder&rdquo;). Pursuant to the terms
of the Merger Agreement
 Acquisition Sub merged with and into Keeler &amp; Co
 which was the surviving corporation and thus became
our wholly-owned subsidiary (the &ldquo;Merger&rdquo;).

At
the Closing Date
 each of the 500 shares of common stock of Keeler &amp; Co issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing
of the Merger was converted into 30
000 shares of our common stock. As a result
 an aggregate of 15
000
000 shares of our common
stock were issued to the Sole Stockholder.

At
the effective time of the Merger
 the Company redeemed an aggregate of 9
250
000 shares of common stock from the pre-Merger stockholders
of the Company (the &ldquo;Pre-Merger Holders&rdquo;) for cancellation by the Company (the &ldquo;Share Redemption&rdquo;) and
as a result
 the Pre-Merger Holders retained an aggregate of 750
000 shares of common stock after the Merger
 representing a value
of $1.5 million. The shares were redeemed in consideration for the direct benefit the Pre-Merger Holders will receive in connection
with the consummation of the Merger.



Concurrently
with the closing of the Merger
 we closed a private placement offering (the &ldquo;Offering&rdquo;) in which we sold an aggregate
of 725 units of our securities (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo;) at a purchase price of $1
000 per Unit
 for aggregate gross proceeds
of $725
000. Each Unit consisted of one share of the Company&rsquo;s 8% Series A convertible preferred stock
 par value $0.0001
per share (the &ldquo;Series A Stock&rdquo;) and a Warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock for every share of
common stock that would be received upon conversion of a share of Series A Stock (the &ldquo;Warrant Shares&rdquo;)
 at an exercise
price of $2.40. The Series A Stock is convertible into shares (the &ldquo;Conversion Shares&rdquo;) of the Company&rsquo;s common
stock
 at a conversion rate of $2.00 per share (the &ldquo;Conversion Rate&rdquo;). We issued 353
250 Warrant Shares in the Offering
which Warrant Shares are exercisable independently of any conversion of Series A Stock. The net proceeds of the Offering were
used by the Company for general corporate purposes.

(the &ldquo;Series A Stock&rdquo;)
 initially convertible into shares (the
&ldquo;Conversion Shares&rdquo;) of the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock
 at a conversion rate of $2.00 per share
 and (ii) a three-year
warrant (the &ldquo;Warrant&rdquo;) to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock for every share of Common Stock that would
be received upon conversion of a share of Series A Stock (the &ldquo;Warrant Shares&rdquo;)
 at an exercise price equal to $2.40.


    
    


Company
Settlement

Effective
upon the closing of the Merger
 we issued an aggregate of 688 Units to eleven &ldquo;accredited investors&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Settlement
Parties&rdquo;) for each such individual or entity entering into a settlement and mutual general release agreement (the &ldquo;Settlement
Agreement&rdquo;) with the Company in full and complete settlement and satisfaction and release of claims such Settlement Parties
may have against the Company (the &ldquo;Company Settlement&rdquo;).

2018
Equity Incentive Award Plan

In
connection with the Merger
 we adopted the 2018 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the &ldquo;2018 Plan&rdquo;)
 which was effective
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. The principal purpose of the 2018 Plan is to attract
 retain and motivate
selected employees
 consultants and non-employee directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based
performance bonus awards. 7
500
000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan as future incentive awards
to executive officers
 employees
 consultants and directors.

Upon
the closing of the Merger
 (i) options to purchase an aggregate of 104 shares of Keeler &amp; Co&rsquo;s common stock at an exercise
price of $10
000 per share
 which were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger
 were converted into ten-year
immediately exercisable options to purchase an aggregate of 3
120
000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.333 under
the 2018 Plan
 and (ii) ten-year options to purchase 3
120
000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.00
 which vest
one-year from the date of grant
 were issued under the 2018 Plan.

Changes
to the Board of Directors and Executive Officers

On
the Closing Date of the Merger
 Laura Anthony and Howard Gostfrand
 the then-current directors and Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company
 respectively
 resigned from all such positions as directors and officers of the Company
and were replaced by new officers and directors. Immediately following the closing of the Merger
 our board of directors was reconstituted
to consist of John Keeler
 Carlos Faria
 Christopher Constable and Nubar Herian.



In
connection with the Merger
 each of our executive officers and directors after giving effect to the Merger (the &ldquo;Restricted
Holders&rdquo;) and each of the Pre-Merger Holders
 holding at the closing date of the Merger an aggregate of 750
000 shares of
our common stock
 entered into lock-up agreements (the &ldquo;Lock-Up Agreements&rdquo;)
 whereby the Restricted Holders are restricted
for a period of 18 months and the Pre-Merger Holders are restricted for 12 months
 after the Merger (the &ldquo;Restricted Period&rdquo;)
from sales or dispositions (including pledges) in excess of 50% of all of the Common Stock held by (or issuable to) them and at
a price below $2.20 per share (such restrictions together the &ldquo;Lock-Up&rdquo;). Notwithstanding such restrictions
 during
the Restricted Period (i) the Restricted Holders may transfer up to 10% of their shares to a charitable organization which agrees
to be bound by such Lock-Up restrictions and (ii) the Pre-Merger Holders may transfer up to 10% of their shares to a third party
which agrees to be bound by such Lock-Up restrictions. From and after the Restricted Period
 neither the Restricted Holders nor
the Pre-Merger Holders may sell
 dispose or otherwise transfer more than one-third of the Common Stock held by such Holder in
any two-month period.

Redemption
from Pre-Merger Holders

In
connection with the Merger
 the Company redeemed an aggregate of 9
250
000 shares of Common Stock from the Company&rsquo;s pre-Merger
stockholders (the &ldquo;Pre-Merger Holders&rdquo;) for cancellation by the Company (the &ldquo;Share Redemption&rdquo;) and
as a result
 the stockholders retained an aggregate of 750
000 shares of common stock after the Merger (the &ldquo;Retained Shares&rdquo;)
representing a value of $1.5 million. The shares were redeemed in consideration for the direct benefit the Pre-Merger Holders
will receive in connection with the consummation of the Merger.


    
    


Our
authorized capital stock currently consists of 100
000
000 shares of Common Stock
 and 5
000
000 shares of the preferred stock
of which 10
000 shares have been designated as Series A Stock. Our Common Stock is not traded on any exchange or quoted on the
OTC Markets
 and there is no public market for our Common Stock.

Coastal
Pride Acquisition

On
November 26
 2019
 Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Purchaser&rdquo;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization
(the &ldquo;Coastal Merger Agreement&rdquo;) with Coastal Pride Company
 Inc.
 a South Carolina corporation (&ldquo;Coastal Pride&rdquo;)
Coastal Pride Seafood
 LLC
 a Florida limited liability company and newly-formed
 wholly-owned subsidiary of Keeler &amp; Co.
(the &ldquo;Acquisition Subsidiary&rdquo; and
 upon the effective date of the Coastal Merger
 the &ldquo;Surviving Company)
 and
The Walter F. Lubkin
 Jr. Irrevocable Trust dated 1/8/03 (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;)
 Walter F. Lubkin III (&ldquo;Lubkin III&rdquo;)
Tracy Lubkin Greco (&ldquo;Greco&rdquo;) and John C. Lubkin (&ldquo;Lubkin&rdquo;)
 constituting all of the shareholders of Coastal
Pride immediately prior to the Coastal Merger (collectively
 the &ldquo;Sellers&rdquo;). Pursuant to the terms of the Coastal
Merger Agreement
 Coastal Pride merged with and into the Acquisition Subsidiary
 with the Acquisition Subsidiary being the surviving
company (the &ldquo;Coastal Merger&rdquo;).

Coastal
Pride is a seafood company
 based in Beaufort
 South Carolina
 that imports pasteurized and fresh crabmeat sourced primarily from
Mexico and Latin America and sells premium branded label crabmeat throughout North America.

Pursuant
to the terms of the Coastal Merger Agreement
 the following consideration was paid by Keeler &amp; Co.:

(i)
an aggregate of $394
622 in cash (the &ldquo;Cash Consideration&rdquo;);

(ii)
a five-year 4% promissory note in the principal amount of $500
000 (the &ldquo;Lubkin Note)
 issued by Keeler &amp; Co. to Walter
Lubkin Jr. (&ldquo;Walter Jr.&rdquo;);

(iii)
three-year 4% convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $210
000 (collectively
 the &ldquo;Sellers Notes&rdquo;
and together with the Lubkin Note
 the &ldquo;Notes&rdquo;)
 issued by Keeler &amp; Co. to Greco
 Walter III and Lubkin
 pro rata
to their ownership of Coastal Pride immediately prior to the Merger;

(iii)
500
000 shares of common stock of the Company
 issued to Walter Lubkin
 Jr. (the &ldquo;Walter Jr. Shares&rdquo;); and

(iii)
an aggregate of 795
000 shares of common stock of the Company
 issued to Greco
 Walter III and Lubkin
 pro rata to their ownership
of Coastal Pride immediately prior to the Coastal Merger (together with the Walter Jr. Shares
 the &ldquo;Consideration Shares&rdquo;).

The
Notes are subject to a right of offset against the Sellers&rsquo; indemnification obligations as described in the Coastal Merger
Agreement and are subordinate and subject to prior payment of all indebtedness of John Keeler under the Loan Agreement with ACF
Finco I LP (&ldquo;ACF&rdquo;)
 as described below.

Principal
and interest under the Lubkin Note are payable quarterly
 commencing February 26
 2020
 in an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
$25
000 and (i) 25% of the Surviving Company&rsquo;s quarterly earnings before interest
 tax
 depreciation and amortization.

One-sixth
of the principal and interest under the Sellers Notes are payable quarterly commencing on August 26
 2021. The Sellers Notes are
convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at the Seller&rsquo;s option
 at any time after the first anniversary of
the date of the Note
 at the rate of one share for each $2.00 of principal and/or interest so converted (the &ldquo;Conversion
Shares&rdquo;).

The
Purchaser has the right to prepay the Notes in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium.


    
    


At
the effective time of the Coastal Merger
 the Sellers entered into leak-out agreements (each
 a &ldquo;Leak-Out
Agreement&rdquo;) pursuant to which the Sellers and Walter Jr. may not directly or indirectly pledge
 sell
 or transfer any
of the Consideration Shares or Conversion Shares
 or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers any of the
economic consequences of ownership of any such shares for one year from the date of the Coastal Merger. Thereafter
 each
Seller and Walter Jr. may transfer up to 25% of the aggregate of the Consideration Shares and the Conversion Shares held by
such person
 in each successive six-month period.

In
connection with the Coastal Merger
 Lubkin III and Greco agreed to serve as president and chief financial officer
 respectively
of the Surviving Company.

Loan
Agreement with ACF

ACF
and Keeler &amp; Co. are parties to a Loan and Security Agreement
 originally dated as of August 31
 2016 (as amended
 the &ldquo;Loan
Agreement&rdquo;). Keeler &amp; Co.&rsquo;s obligations under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the Company. As a condition
to ACF&rsquo;s waiver of certain events of default under the Loan Agreement
 and consent to the formation of the Acquisition Subsidiary
and the Coastal Merger
 the Acquisition Subsidiary and Keeler &amp; Co. entered into the Joinder and Seventh Amendment to the
Loan Agreement (the &ldquo;Seventh Amendment&rdquo;) which resulted
 among other things
 in the Surviving Company becoming an
additional borrower under the Loan Agreement.

strategy is to create a vertically integrated seafood company that offers customers high quality products while maintaining a
focus on our core values of delivering food safety
 traceability and certified sustainability.

We
plan to grow the Company organically by continuing to grow our customer base
 offering additional species to our customers
 introducing
new value-added product lines and strategically acquiring companies with strong portfolio of anchored categories that we believe
we can integrate into a larger
 vertically integrated company.

Competitive
Strengths -Sustainable and Traceable Product Sourcing

We
believe that our greatest point of differentiation from other seafood companies are our efforts to ensure that our seafood products
are ethically sourced in a method that is consistent with our core values and those of our customers.


    
    


We
purchase the majority of our crab product from processors which source the crab meat from local fishermen in Indonesia
 the Philippines
Thailand
 Vietnam
 Sri Lanka and India
 to whom we pay a premium in order to outfit their boats with a proprietary GPS-based system.
This system allows us to trace where the crab product originates and ensure that only mature crabs are being harvested by the
use of collapsible traps and not gill nets.

We
have created a technology platform that tracks the product through its entire chain of custody and collects and transmits various
data to the Company in real-time
 from the loading site
 to the packing plant
 through the sorting and pasteurization process
and the exporting process to the end customer. Our technology allows our customers access to their &ldquo;Scan on Demand&rdquo;
QR code-enabled traceability application.

The
crab meat is purchased directly from processors with whom we have long-standing relationships
 that have agreed to source their
product in a sustainable manner. All crab meat is sourced under the Company&rsquo;s FDA approved Hazard Analysis Critical Control
Point (&ldquo;HACCP&rdquo;) Plan. Additionally
 all suppliers are certified by the British Retail Consortium (the &ldquo;BRC&rdquo;)
and are audited annually to ensure safety and quality of our product.

warehouse facility in Miami

In
general
 the international seafood industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with local and overseas
manufacturers and importers engaged in similar products.

Industry
Overview

The
international seafood industry is going through a period of rapid change as it strives to meet the needs of a growing population
around the world
 where food consumption habits are evolving. We believe there are powerful trends emerging in the developing
world (including a growing demand for animal-based protein) as well as and in the developed world (where there is an increased
awareness and focus on sustainable sourcing and protecting marine ecosystems).

Population
Growth and Global Seafood Consumption



    
&#9679;
    
The
    United Nations estimates that there will be close to 9.8 billion people on our planet by the year 2050(1)
 a significant increase
    from the existing population estimates of 7.6 billion. (1)

    
    
    

    
    
United
    Nations &ndash; Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2017)




    
    
As
    the population has grown
 so has per capita consumption. World per capita apparent fish consumption increased from an average
    of 9.9 kg in the 1960s to 14.4 kg in the 1990s and 19.7 kg in 2013
 with preliminary estimates for 2014 and 2015 pointing
    towards further growth beyond 20 kg. (2)

Sources
of Seafood



    
&#9679;
    
Global
    total capture fishery production in 2014 was 93.4 million tons
 of which 81.5 million tons from marine waters and 11.9 million
    tons from inland waters (3).

&#9679;
    
Where
    seafood comes is sourced is changing in order to meet the demand. In 2014
 a milestone was reached when the aquaculture sector&rsquo;s
    contribution to the supply of fish for human consumption overtook that of wild-caught fish for the first time (4).

Industry Participants



    
    
The
    mix of parties involved in seafood varies from the local village fisherman
 to large

 vertically-integrated
    seafood companies. 

    
    
    

    
&#9679;
    
The
    total number of fishing vessels in the world in 2014 is estimated at about 4.6 million
 with the fleet in Asia being the largest
    consisting of 3.5 million vessels and accounting for 75 percent of the global fleet
 followed by Africa (15%)
 Latin America
    and the Caribbean (6%)
 North America (2%) and Europe (2%) (5).

Growth
Strategy

We
intend to grow the business organically and through strategic acquisitions.


    
    


Organic
growth &ndash; We believe that allocating additional capital to our existing business plan will allow us to continue to meet growing
demand from end-customers for seafood products. The Company also currently intends to introduce new species
 including lobster
tails
 fin fish and other specialty seafood proteins in the next 18 months.

Acquisitions
&ndash;We also currently intend to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the fragmented seafood industry. We believe that such potential
acquisitions may add value in several ways
 including geographical diversification and new anchor category specifies offerings
as well as operational and price synergies.



We
currently have the following products: Blue Star

We
purchase crab meat directly from 13 processors with which we have long-standing relationships
 that have agreed to source their
product in a sustainable manner. All crab meat is sourced under the Company&rsquo;s FDA approved HACCP Plan. Additionally
 all
suppliers are certified by the BRC grade A and are audited annually to ensure safety and quality.

The
Company has three suppliers which accounted for approximately 63% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended
December 31
 2019. These three suppliers are located in the United States
 Indonesia and the Philippines
 which accounted for
approximately 90% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during 2019. These suppliers included Bacolod Blue Star Export Corp.
(&ldquo;Bacolod&rdquo;)
 an affiliated party based in the Philippines
 which accounted for approximately 27% of the Company&rsquo;s
total purchases during 2019. During 2019
 the Company purchased inventory from a competitor that went out of business in the United
States accounting for 21% of purchases
 and four non-affiliated Indonesian suppliers
 that made up the balance of the 30% of the
supply concentration.

Sales
Marketing and Distribution

The
Company&rsquo;s products are sold in the United States
 Mexico
 Canada
 Central America
 the Caribbean
 the European Union
 the
United Arab Emirates
 Singapore and Hong Kong. Its primary current source of revenue is importing blue and red swimming crab meat
primarily from Indonesia
 Mexico
 Venezuela
 Malaysia
 Sri-Lanka
 China
 the Philippines and Vietnam and distributing it in the
United States
 Canada and Europe under several brand names such as Blue Star
 Oceanica
 Pacifika
 and Lubkin&rsquo;s Coastal Pride
First Choice

 Coastal Pride Fresh.


    
    


The
Company has a sales team of eight employees based throughout the U.S. who sell directly to customers most of whom are in the food
service and retail industry and also manage a network of five regional and national brokers
 that cover both the retail and wholesale
segments. The sales team and brokers help to pull the products through the system by creating demand at the end user level and
pulling the demand through our distributor customers. We sell to retail customers either directly or via distributors that specialize
in the retail segment.

The
Company does not own its own fleet of trucks and utilizes &ldquo;LTL&rdquo; national freight carriers to deliver its products
to its customers. Less than truckload freight shipping (&ldquo;LTL&rdquo;) is used for the transportation of small freight or
when freight does not require the use of an entire trailer. When shipping LTL
 we pay for a portion of a standard truck trailer
and other shippers and their shipments fill the unoccupied space.

Our
Technology

We
have created a technology platform that tracks the product through its entire chain of custody and collects and transmits various
data to the Company in real-time
 from the loading site
 to the packing plant
 through the sorting and pasteurization process
and the exporting process to the end customer. Our technology allows our customers access to their &ldquo;Scan on Demand&rdquo;
QR code-enabled traceability application.



Our
customer base is comprised of some of the largest companies in the food service and retail industry. We sell our crab meat to
our customers through purchase orders. Currently
 almost 63% of our revenue is derived from fortune 500 customers. For the fiscal
year ended December 31
 2019
 sales to food distributors accounted for 42% of our revenue
 sales to large buying cooperatives
accounted for 16% of our revenue
 and sales to retail and wholesale clubs accounting for 16% of our revenue. The balance of our
revenue derived from smaller seafood distributors and value-added processors.

Our
sales are diversified geographically throughout the United States
 with Florida being the largest geographic concentration at
26% of sales. As typical in the seafood industry
 a large portion of our revenue is located along the eastern seaboard with 57%
of our revenue derived from sales to customers along the East Coast from Massachusetts to Florida. International sales directly
or through our affiliate in the United Kingdom
 Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. make up roughly 3% of revenue.

The
Company had three customers which accounted for approximately 47% of revenue during the year ended December 31
 2019. Outstanding
receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 20% of the total accounts receivable as of December 31
 2019. The
loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
position.

Government
Regulation

Our
distribution facility in Florida and our international suppliers are certified in accordance with the HACCP
 standards for exporting
aquatic products to the United States. The HACCP standards are developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &ldquo;FDA&rdquo;)
pursuant to the FDA&rsquo;s HACCP regulation
 Title 21
 Code of Federal Regulations
 part 123
 and are used by the FDA to help
ensure food safety and control sanitary standards.

Food
Safety and Labeling

We
are subject to extensive regulation
 including
 among other things
 the Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act
 as amended by the Food Safety
Modernization Act (&ldquo;FSMA&rdquo;)
 the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002
 and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. FSMA was enacted in order to aid the effective prevention of food
safety issues in the food supply. This comprehensive and evolving regulatory program will impact how food is grown
 packed
 processed
shipped and imported into the United States and will govern compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (&ldquo;GMPs&rdquo;).
The FDA has finalized seven major rules to implement FSMA
 recognizing that ensuring the safety of the food supply is a shared
responsibility among many different points in the global supply chain. The FSMA rules are designed to make clear specific actions
that must be taken at each of these points to prevent contamination. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard
for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations
 we may be subject to
civil remedies
 including fines
 injunctions
 recalls
 or seizures
 and criminal sanctions
 any of which could impact our results
of operations.

In
addition
 the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 prescribes the format and content of certain information required to
appear on the labels of food products.

Our
operations and products are also subject to state and local regulation
 including the registration and licensing of plants
 enforcement
by state health agencies of various state standards
 and the registration and inspection of facilities. Compliance with federal
state and local regulation is costly and time-consuming. Enforcement actions for violations of federal
 state
 and local regulations
may include seizure and condemnation of products
 cease and desist orders
 injunctions or monetary penalties. We believe that
our practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations.



For
the purchase of products harvested or manufactured outside of the United States
 and for the shipment of products to customers
located outside of the United States
 we are subject to customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments. Our activities
including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders
 are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection
part of the Department of Homeland Security.

Federal
Trade Commission

We
are subject to certain regulations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Advertising of our products is subject to such regulation
pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

Employee
Safety Regulations

We
are subject to certain health and safety regulations
 including regulations issued pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health
Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing
 health
 and safety standards to protect our employees
from accidents.


    
    




Because
we are organized under the laws of a state in the U.S. and our principal place of business is in the U.S.
 we are considered a
&ldquo;domestic concern&rdquo; under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&ldquo;FCPA&rdquo;) and are covered by the anti-bribery
provisions of the FCPA. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit any domestic concern and any officer
 director
 employee
or agent
 acting on behalf of the domestic concern from paying or authorizing payment of anything of value to (i) influence any
act or decision by a foreign official; (ii) induce a foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his/her lawful
duty; (iii) secure any improper advantage; or (iv) induce a foreign official to use his/her influence to assist the payor in obtaining
or retaining business
 or directing business to another person.

Environmental
Regulation

We
are subject to a number of federal
 state
 and local laws and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment
and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These requirements relate to a broad range of our activities
 including:
the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the identification
 generation
 storage
 handling
 transportation
 disposal
recordkeeping
 labeling
 and reporting of
 and emergency response in connection with
 hazardous materials (including asbestos)
associated with our operations; noise emissions from our facilities; and safety and health standards
 practices
 and procedures
that apply to the workplace and the operation of our facilities. Insurance

We
maintain general liability and product liability
 property
 worker&rsquo;s compensation and business interruption insurance and
are in the process of obtaining director and officer insurance in amounts and on terms that we believe are customary for companies
similarly situated. In addition
 we maintain excess insurance where we believe it is reasonably cost effective.



As
of May 28
 2020
 we have eighteen full time employees and no part-time employees. We believe that our future success will depend
in part
 on our continued ability to attract
 hire and retain qualified personnel.

 YOU SHOULD SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER THE VARIOUS FACTORS IDENTIFIED IN THIS ANNUAL

 INCLUDING THE MATTERS SET FORTH BELOW
 WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED BY SUCH

Risks
Relating to Our Company and Business

Future
acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.

Selective
acquisitions currently form part of our strategy to further expand our business. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities
we may acquire additional businesses
 services or products that are complementary to our core business. Future acquisitions and
the subsequent integration of new companies into ours would require significant attention from our management. Future acquisitions
would also expose us to potential risks
 including risks associated with the assimilation of new operations
 services and personnel
unforeseen or hidden liabilities
 the diversion of resources from our existing businesses and technologies
 the inability to generate
sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions and potential loss of
 or harm to
 relationships with employees
as a result of integration of new businesses. The diversion of our management&rsquo;s attention and any difficulties encountered
in any integration process could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.


    
    


The
value of crab meat is subject to fluctuation which may result in volatility of our results of operations and the value of an investment
in the Company.

Our
business is dependent upon the sale of a commodity which value is subject to fluctuation and which value greatly fluctuates. Our
net sales and operating results vary significantly due to the volatility of the value of the crab meat that we sell which may
result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock.

A
material decline in the population and biomass of crab meat that we sell in the fisheries from which we obtain our crab meat would
materially and adversely affect our business.

The
population and biomass of crab meat are subject to natural fluctuations which are beyond our control and which may be exacerbated
by disease
 reproductive problems or other biological issues and may be affected by changes in weather and global environmental
changes. The overall health of a crab or other fish is difficult to measure
 and fisheries management is still a relatively inexact
science. Since we are unable to predict the timing and extent of fluctuations in the population and biomass of our products
 we
are unable to engage in any measures that might alleviate the adverse effects of these fluctuations. Any such fluctuation which
results in a material decline in the population and biomass in the fisheries from which we obtain our crab meat would materially
and adversely affect our business. Our operations are also subject to the risk of variations in supply.

We
are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.

The
sales of our products may involve the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized personnel
product contamination or spoilage
 including the presence of foreign objects
 substances
 chemicals
 or residues introduced during
the packing
 storage
 handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe
our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations
 including internal product safety policies
we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be
subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful
 the negative publicity
surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential
customers and our brand image.

A
significant portion of our revenues are derived from a single product
 crab meat
 and therefore we are highly susceptible to changes
in market demand
 which may be affected by factors over which we have limited or no control.

A
significant portion of our revenues are derived from a single product
 crab meat. We therefore are highly susceptible to changes
in market demand
 which may be impacted by factors over which we have limited or no control. Factors that could lead to a decline
in market demand for crab meat include economic conditions and evolving consumer preferences. A substantial downturn in market
demand for crab meat may have a material adverse effect on our business and on our results of operations.

Risks
Related to Our Industry

Regulation
of the fishing industry may have an adverse impact on our business.

The
international community has been aware of and concerned with the worldwide problem of depletion of natural fish stocks. In the
past
 these concerns have resulted in the imposition of quotas that subject individual countries to strict limitations on the
amount of seafood that is allowed to be caught or harvested. Environmental groups have been lobbying for additional limitations.
If international organizations or national governments were to impose additional limitations on crab meat or the seafood products
we sell
 this could have a negative impact on our results of operations.


    
    


Segments
of the seafood industry in which we operate are competitive
 and our inability to compete successfully could adversely affect
our business
 results of operations and financial condition.

We
compete with major integrated seafood companies such as Tri Union Frozen Products
 Inc. (Chicken of the Sea Frozen Foods)
 Phillips
Foods
 Inc.
 Harbor Seafood
 Inc.
 Bonamar Corporation and Twin Tails Seafood Corp. Some of our competitors have the benefit of
marketing their products under brand names that have better market recognition than ours or have stronger marketing and distribution
channels than we do. Increased competition as to any of our products could result in price reduction
 reduced margins and loss
of market share
 which could negatively affect our profitability. An increase in imported products in the U.S. at low prices could
also negatively affect our profitability.

Our
insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover losses we may incur or to fully replace a significant loss of assets.

Our
involvement in the fishing industry may result in liability for pollution
 property damage
 personal injury or other hazards.
Although we believe we have obtained insurance in accordance with industry standards to address such risks
 such insurance has
limitations on liability and/or deductible amounts that may not be sufficient to cover the full extent of such liabilities or
losses. In addition
 such risks may not
 in all circumstances
 be insurable or
 in certain circumstances
 we may choose not to
obtain insurance to protect against specific risks due to the high premiums associated with such insurance or for other reasons.
The payment of such uninsured liabilities would reduce the funds available to us. If we suffer a significant event or occurrence
that is not fully insured
 or if the insurer of such event is not solvent
 we could be required to divert funds from capital investment
or other uses towards covering any liability or loss for such events.

Our
operations
 revenue and profitability could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations in the countries where we
do business.

The
governments of countries into which we sell our products
 from time to time
 consider regulatory proposals relating to raw materials
food safety and markets
 and environmental regulations
 which
 if adopted
 could lead to disruptions in distribution of our products
and increase our operational costs
 which
 in turn
 could affect our profitability. To the extent that we increase our product
prices as a result of such changes
 our sales volume and revenues may be adversely affected.

Furthermore
these governments may change import regulations or impose additional taxes or duties on certain imports from time to time. These
regulations and fees or new regulatory developments may have a material adverse impact on our operations
 revenue and profitability.
If one or more of the countries into which we sell our products bars the import or sale of crab meat or related products
 our
available market would shrink significantly
 adversely impacting our results of operations and growth potential.

A
decline in discretionary consumer spending may adversely affect our industry
 our operations and ultimately our profitability.

Luxury
products
 such as premium grade crab meat
 are discretionary purchases for consumers. Any reduction in consumer discretionary
spending or disposable income may affect the crab meat industry significantly. Many economic factors outside of our control could
affect consumer discretionary spending
 including the financial markets
 consumer credit availability
 prevailing interest rates
energy costs
 employment levels
 salary levels
 and tax rates. Any reduction in discretionary consumer spending could materially
adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Risks
Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties

We
are dependent on third parties for our operations.

Our
business is dependent upon our relationships with vendors in Southeast Asia for co-packing
 processing and shipping product to
us. If for any reason these companies became unable or unwilling to continue to provide services to us
 this would likely lead
to a temporary interruption in our ability to import our products until we found another entity that could provide these services.
Failure to find a suitable replacement
 even on a temporary basis
 would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.


    
    


We
are primarily dependent on two suppliers to provide our crab meat product.

The
Company had two suppliers which accounted for approximately 42% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended December
31
 2019. These two suppliers are located in Indonesia and the Philippines. These suppliers included Bacolod
 which accounted
for approximately 27% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during 2019. The loss of any major supplier could have a material
adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial position. John Keeler
 our Executive Chairman
owns 95%
 of Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat from the Philippines
 and 95% of Bicol Blue Star Export Co.
 a Philippine
company (&ldquo;Bicol&rdquo;)
 and an indirect supplier of crab meat to the Company through Bacolod.

Three
customers accounted for 46% of our revenue.

The
Company had three customers which accounted for approximately 46% of revenue during the year ended December 31
 2019. Outstanding
receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 24% of the total accounts receivable as of December 31
 2019. The
loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
position.

All
of our significant customer contracts and some of our supplier contracts are short-term and may not be renewable on terms favorable
to us
 or at all.

All
of our customers and some of our suppliers operate through purchase orders or short-term contracts. Though we have long-term business
relationships with many of our customers and suppliers and alternative sources of supply for key items
 we cannot be sure that
any of these customers or suppliers will continue to do business with us on the same basis. Additionally
 although we try to renew
these contracts as they expire
 there can be no assurance that these customers or suppliers will renew these contracts on terms
that are favorable to us
 if at all. The termination of
 or modification to
 any number of these contracts may adversely affect
our business and prospects
 including our financial performance and results of operations.

Risks
Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements

Our
independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going
concern in its report on our audited financial statements.

The
report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2019 includes an explanatory
paragraph stating that for the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company incurred a net loss of $5
021
703
 has an accumulated
deficit of $8
952
466 and working capital deficit of $2
786
086
 inclusive of $2
910
136 in subordinated stockholder debt. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to increase revenues
 execute on its business plan to acquire complimentary
companies
 raise capital and continue to sustain adequate working capital to finance its operations. If we are unable to do so
our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as
a going concern.

We
need to raise additional capital to fund our existing commercial operations and develop and commercialize new products and expand
our operations.

Our
current available cash balances and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements.
We will require substantial additional funds our operations
 for the service of debt and to fund our business objectives We will
have to continue to rely on equity and debt financing. There can be no assurance that financing
 whether debt or equity
 will
always be available to us in the amount required at any particular time or for any particular period or
 if available
 that it
can be obtained on terms favorable to us. Additionally
 the continued spread of COVID-19 and uncertain market conditions may limit
the Company&rsquo;s ability to access capital.


    
    


COVID-19
has also caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets
 which severely impacts our ability to raise additional
capital.

The
full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report
 is highly uncertain and subject to change.
Management is actively monitoring the situation but given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak
 the Company is not able
to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its operations or financial condition in the next 12 months. However
 while
significant uncertainty remains
 the Company believes it is likely that the COVID-19 outbreak may have a negative impact on its
ability to raise additional financing.

We
may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business
 to pursue strategic investments
 to take advantage
of financing opportunities or for other reasons
 including to:



    
    
increase
    our sales and marketing efforts and address competitive developments; 

    
    
    

    
    
provide
    for supply and inventory costs; 

    
    
    

    
    
fund
    development and marketing efforts of any future products or additional features to then-current products; 

    
    
    

    
    
acquire
    license or invest in new technologies; 

    
    
    

    
&#9679;
    
acquire
    or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and 

    
    
    

    
    
finance
    capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses. 


Our
present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors
 including:



    
    
our
    ability to achieve revenue growth and improve gross margins; 

    
    
    

    
    
the
    cost of expanding our operations and offerings
 including our sales and marketing efforts; 

    
    
    

    
    
the
                                         effect of competing market developments;

    
    
    

    
    
costs
                                         related to international expansion; and the continuing effects of COVID-19.


The
various ways we could raise additional capital carry potential risks. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities
 dilution
to our stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also could provide for rights
 preferences or privileges senior
to those of holders of our Common Stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities
 those debt securities would have rights
preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant
to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing
arrangements
 we might be required to relinquish significant rights or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.

We
incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management expects to devote substantial time to
public company compliance.

As
a public company
 we incur significant legal
 accounting and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure
obligations applicable to us
 including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 as amended (the &ldquo;Sarbanes-Oxley
Act&rdquo;)
 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &ldquo;Dodd-Frank Act&rdquo;) as well as rules
implemented by the SEC
 and the OTC Markets. Stockholder activism
 the current political environment and the current high level
of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations
 which may
lead to additional compliance costs and impact
 in ways we cannot currently anticipate
 the manner in which we operate our business.
Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of and compliance
with
 public company reporting obligations. These rules and regulations cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance
costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly.


    
    


To
comply with the requirements of being a public company
 we may need to undertake various actions
 including implementing new internal
controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our
disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file with the SEC is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms
and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal
executive and financial officers. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate and weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective
controls could negatively impact the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting
firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we may be required
to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 harm our operating results
cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. In the
event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 that our internal control over financial reporting
is perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements
 investors may lose confidence
in our operating results and the price of our common stock could decline. In addition
 if we are unable to continue to meet these
requirements
 our common stock may not be able to be eligible for quotation on the OTC Markets or meet the eligibility requirements
for the NASDAQ Stock Market.

We
are required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore are required
to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. We are required
to comply with certain of these rules
 which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and
annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
During the evaluation and testing process
 if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting
 we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Our
independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting until the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an
&ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; as defined in the JOBS Act depending on whether we choose to rely on certain exemptions
set forth in the JOBS Act. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective
 or if our
independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting
 we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports
 which could
harm our business.

Our
loan and security agreement with ACF Finco I LP (&ldquo;ACF&rdquo;)
 contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict
business and financing activities of our wholly-owned subsidiaries
 John Keeler &amp; Co
 Inc. and Coastal Pride.

As
of December 31
 2019
 we had $6
917
968 in outstanding debt to ACF. Borrowings under our loan and security agreement with ACF
are secured by substantially all of our personal property
 including our intellectual property. Our loan and security agreement
contains affirmative and negative covenants which restricts our wholly-owned subsidiary
 John Keeler &amp; Co
 Inc.&rsquo;s and
its subsidiary
 Coastal Pride&rsquo;s ability to
 among other things:



    
    
dispose
    of or sell its assets; 

    
    
    

    
    
make
    material changes in its business; 




    
    
merge
    with or acquire other entities or assets; 

    
    
    

    
    
incur
    additional indebtedness; 



    
    




    
    
create
    liens on its assets; 

    
    
    

    
    
pay
    dividends; and

    
    
    

    
    
make
    investments. 


The
operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our loan and security agreement
 as well as any future financing agreements
into which we may enter
 may restrict our or our subsidiary&rsquo;s ability to finance operations and engage in
 expand or otherwise
pursue business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control
and future breaches of any of these covenants could result in a default under our loan and security agreement. If not waived
future defaults could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our loan and security agreement to become immediately due
and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.

If
we do not have or are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable
either upon maturity or in the event of a default
 we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable
terms
 if at all
 which may negatively impact our ability to operate and continue our business as a going concern.

We
face risks related to the current global economic environment which could harm our business
 financial condition and results of
operations.

The
state of the global economy continues to be uncertain. The current global economic conditions and uncertain credit markets
 concerns
regarding the availability of credit pose a risk that could impact our international relationships
 as well as our ability to
manage normal commercial relationships with our customers
 suppliers and creditors
 including financial institutions. Global trade
issues and the impositions of tariffs could also have an adverse effect on our international business activities. If the current
global economic environment deteriorates
 our business could be negatively affected.

Risks
Related to Administrative
 Organizational and Commercial Operations and Growth

We
may be unable to manage our future growth effectively
 which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.

We
anticipate growth in our business operations. This future growth could create a strain on our organizational
 administrative and
operational infrastructure
 including manufacturing operations
 quality control
 technical support and customer service
 sales
force management and general and financial administration. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue
to improve our operational
 financial and management controls
 as well as our reporting systems and procedures. If we are unable
to manage our growth effectively
 we may be unable to execute our business plan
 which could have a material adverse effect on
our business and our results of operations.

If
we are unable to support demand for our current and our future products
 including ensuring that we have adequate resources to
meet increased demand our business could be harmed.

As
our commercial operations and sales volume grow
 we will need to continue to increase our workflow capacity for processing
 customer
service
 billing and general process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program
 among other things. We may
also need to purchase additional equipment and increase our manufacturing
 maintenance
 software and computing capacity to meet
increased demand. We cannot assure you that any of these increases in scale
 expansion of personnel
 purchase of equipment or
process enhancements will be successfully implemented.


    
    


The
loss of our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled officers and
key personnel could negatively impact our business.

Our
success depends on the skills
 experience and performance of our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The individual
and collective efforts of these individuals will be important as we continue to develop and expand our commercial activities.
The loss or incapacity of existing members of our executive management team could negatively impact our operations if we experience
difficulties in hiring qualified successors. Qualified employees periodically are in great demand and may be unavailable in the
time frame required to satisfy our customers&rsquo; requirements. Expansion of our business could require us to employ additional
personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of skilled employees in the
future. The loss of personnel or our inability to hire or retain sufficient personnel at competitive rates could impair the growth
of our business.

If
we were sued for product liability or professional liability
 we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.

The
marketing and sale of our products could lead to the filing of product liability claims alleging that our product made users ill.
A product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.

We
maintain product liability insurance
 but this insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against
product liability claims. Any product liability claim brought against us
 with or without merit
 could increase our insurance
rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally
 any product liability lawsuit could lead to
regulatory investigations
 product recalls or withdrawals
 damage our reputation or cause current vendors
 suppliers and customers
to terminate existing agreements and potential customers and partners to seek other suppliers
 any of which could negatively impact
our results of operations.

We
face risks associated with our international business.

Our
international business operations are subject to a variety of risks
 including:



    
    
difficulties
    with managing foreign and geographically dispersed operations; 

    
    
    

    
    
having
    to comply with various U.S. and international laws
 including export control laws and the FCPA
 and anti-money laundering
    laws; 

    
    
    

    
    
changes
    in uncertainties relating to foreign rules and regulations;

    
    
    

    
    
tariffs
    export or import restrictions
 restrictions on remittances abroad
 imposition of duties or taxes that limit our ability to
    import product; 

    
    
    

    
    
limitations
    on our ability to enter into cost-effective arrangements with distributors
 or at all;

    
    
    

    
    
fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates;

    
    
    

    
    
imposition
    of limitations on production
 sale or export in foreign countries;

    
    
    

    
    
imposition
    of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign processors or joint
    ventures;

    
    
    

    
    
imposition
    of differing labor laws and standards;

    
    
    

    
    
economic
    political or social instability in foreign countries and regions;

    
    
    

    
    
an
    inability
 or reduced ability
 to protect our intellectual property
 including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed
    by government action;

    
    
    

    
    
availability
    of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us;



    
    




    
    
difficulties
    in recruiting and retaining personnel
 and managing international operations; 

    
    
    

    
    
less
                                         developed infrastructure; and impositions on operations from Covid-19.


If
we expand into other target markets we cannot assure you that our expansion plans will be realized
 or if realized
 be successful.
We expect each market to have particular regulatory and funding hurdles to overcome and future developments in these markets
including the uncertainty relating to governmental policies and regulations
 could harm our business. If we expend significant
time and resources on expansion plans that fail or are delayed
 our reputation
 business and financial condition may be harmed.

Our
results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Currently
the majority of our international sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. We pay certain of our suppliers in a foreign
currency and we may pay others in the future in foreign currency. As a result
 an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative
to foreign currencies could require us to reduce our selling price or risk making our product less competitive in international
markets or our costs could increase. Also
 if our international sales increase
 we may enter into a greater number of transactions
denominated in non-U.S. dollars
 which could expose us to foreign currency risks
 including changes in currency exchange rates.

A
larger portion of our revenues may be denominated in other foreign currencies if we expand our international operations. Conducting
business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative
impact on our operating results. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies impact our revenues
cost of revenues and operating margins and result in foreign currency translation gains and losses.

We
could be negatively impacted by violations of applicable anti-corruption laws or violations of our internal policies designed
to ensure ethical business practices.

We
operate in a number of countries throughout the world
 including in countries that do not have as strong a commitment to anti-corruption
and ethical behavior that is required by U.S. laws or by corporate policies. We are subject to the risk that we
 our U.S. employees
or our employees located in other jurisdictions or any third parties that we engage to do work on our behalf in foreign countries
may take action determined to be in violation of anti-corruption laws in any jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Any violation
of anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in substantial fines
 sanctions
 civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment
of operations in certain jurisdictions and might harm our business
 financial condition or results of operations. Further
 detecting
investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior
management.

We
depend on our information technology systems
 and any failure of these systems could harm our business.

We
depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant elements of our operations. We have developed
propriety software for the management and operation of our business. We have installed and expect to expand a number of enterprise
software systems that affect a broad range of business processes and functional areas
 including for example
 systems handling
human resources
 financial controls and reporting
 contract management
 regulatory compliance and other infrastructure operations.

Information
technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources
 including telecommunications or
network failures
 malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover
 despite network security and back-up measures
 some of
our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins
 computer viruses and similar disruptive problems.
Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information technology
and telecommunications systems
 failures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunications systems or
those used by our third-party service providers could prevent us from providing support services and product to our customers
and managing the administrative aspects of our business. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications
systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could harm our business.


    
    


Our
operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural or other disasters
 power loss
 strikes and other events beyond
our control.

We
conduct a significant portion of our activities
 including administration and data processing
 at facilities located in Southern
Florida that have experienced major hurricanes and floods which could affect our facilities
 
 could significantly disrupt our
operations
 and delay or prevent product shipment during the time required to repair
 rebuild or replace damaged processing facilities;
these delays could be lengthy and costly. Our suppliers in Southeast Asia are also vulnerable to natural disasters which could
disrupt their operations and their ability to supply product to us. If any of our customers&rsquo; facilities are negatively impacted
by a disaster
 product shipments could be delayed. Additionally
 customers may delay purchases of products until operations return
to normal. Even if we and/or our suppliers are able to quickly respond to a disaster
 the ongoing effects of the disaster could
create some uncertainty in the operations of our business. In addition
 our facilities may be subject to a shortage of available
electrical power and other energy supplies. Any shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result
in blackouts
 which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business.

Risks
Related to Intellectual Property

Our
intellectual property rights are valuable
 and any inability to adequately protect
 or uncertainty regarding validity
 enforceability
or scope of them could undermine our competitive position and reduce the value of our products
 services and brand
 and litigation
to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly.

We
attempt to strengthen and differentiate our product portfolio by developing new and innovative products and product improvements.
As a result
 our patents
 trademarks
 trade secrets
 copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets to
us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services.
For example
 effective intellectual property protection may not be available in countries in which our products are sold. Also
although we have registered our trademark in various jurisdictions
 our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient
or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete
and hurt our results of operation. Also
 protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Policing unauthorized
use of our proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Litigation might be necessary to protect our intellectual property
rights and any such litigation may be costly and may divert our management&rsquo;s attention from our core business. An adverse
determination in any lawsuit involving our intellectual property is likely to jeopardize our business prospects and reputation.
Although we are not aware of any of such litigation
 we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs
 so we would be forced
to bear all litigation costs if we cannot recover them from other parties. All foregoing factors could harm our business
 financial
condition
 and results of operations. Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to
do business and harm our operating results.

We
may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties
 which
 if determined against us
 could adversely affect
our business and subject us to significant liability to third parties.

Our
success mainly depends on our ability to use and develop our technology and product designs without infringing upon the intellectual
property rights of third parties. We may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violations of other
intellectual property rights of third parties. Holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant
to our product offerings may be unknown to us
 which may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable
terms. There may also be technologies licensed to us and that we rely upon that are subject to infringement or other corresponding
allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies. In addition
 although we endeavor
to ensure that companies that work with us possess appropriate intellectual property rights or licenses
 we cannot fully avoid
the risks of intellectual property rights infringement created by suppliers of components used in our products or by companies
we work with in cooperative research and development activities. Our current or potential competitors may have obtained or may
obtain patents that will prevent
 limit or interfere with our ability to make
 use or sell our products. The defense of intellectual
property claims
 including patent infringement suits
 and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and
time consuming
 and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical personnel and management. These factors
could effectively prevent us from pursuing some or all of our business operations and result in our customers or potential customers
deferring
 canceling or limiting their purchase or use of our products
 which may have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition and results of operations.


    
    


Our
commercial success will depend in part on our success in obtaining and maintaining issued patents and other intellectual property
rights in the United States and elsewhere If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property
 competitors may be able to
use our processes and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have
 which could harm our business.

We
cannot provide any assurances that any of our patents have
 or that any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued
patents will include
 claims with a scope sufficient to protect our products
 any additional features we develop or any new products.
Patents
 if issued
 may be challenged
 deemed unenforceable
 invalidated or circumvented.

Furthermore
though an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable
 its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability
and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products.
Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective
technologies
 designs or methods. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our knowledge or trade secrets
by consultants
 suppliers
 vendors
 former employees and current employees. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect
our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States
 and we may encounter significant problems in protecting
our proprietary rights in these countries. If any of these developments were to occur
 they each could have a negative impact
on our sales.

If
we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets
 our business and competitive position could be harmed.

We
rely upon copyright and trade secret protection
 as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with
our employees
 consultants and third parties
 to protect our confidential and proprietary information. In addition to contractual
measures
 we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures.
Such measures may not
 for example
 in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized
access
 provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant
from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor
 and recourse we take against such misconduct may not
provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated
a trade secret can be difficult
 expensive and time-consuming
 and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition
 trade secrets may
be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary
information
 such as our trade secrets
 were to be disclosed or misappropriated
 or if any such information was independently
developed by a competitor
 our competitive position could be harmed.

We
may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.

The
laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign
jurisdictions. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement or the misappropriation of our intellectual property
rights. For example
 many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third
parties. In addition
 many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties
 including government agencies
or government contractors. In these countries
 patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be
sought on a country-by-country basis
 which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly
 we
may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries
 and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.

Proceedings
to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from
other aspects of our business. Accordingly
 our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.
In addition
 changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability
to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.


    
    


Third
parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated
trade secrets.

Although
we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work
for us
 we may be subject to claims that we or our employees
 consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise
used or disclosed intellectual property
 including trade secrets or other proprietary information
 of a former employer or other
third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims
 in addition
to paying monetary damages
 we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending
against such claims
 litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.

Risks
Related to Regulatory Matters

Our
products and operations are subject to government regulation and oversight both in the United States and abroad
 and our failure
to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business.

The
FDA and other government agencies regulate
 among other things
 with respect to our products and operations:



    
    
design
    development and manufacturing; 

    
    
    

    
    
testing
    labeling
 content and language of instructions for use and storage; 

    
    
    

    
    
product
    safety; 

    
    
    

    
    
marketing
    sales and distribution; 

    
    
    

    
    
record
    keeping procedures; 

    
    
    

    
    
advertising
    and promotion; 

    
    
    

    
    
recalls
    and corrective actions; 

    
    
    

    
    
product
    import and export. 


The
regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result
in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations
 higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.

The
failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions
such as:



    
    
warning
    letters; 

    
    
    

    
    
fines;
    

    
    
    

    
&#9679;
    
injunctions;
    




    
    
civil
    penalties; 

    
    
    

    
    
termination
    of distribution; 

    
    
    

    
    
recalls
    or seizures of products; 



    
    




    
    
delays
    in the introduction of products into the market; and

    
    
    

    
    
total
    or partial suspension of production.


We
may also be required to take corrective actions
 such as installing additional equipment or taking other actions
 each of which
could require us to make substantial capital expenditures. We could also be required to indemnify our employees in connection
with any expenses or liabilities that they may incur individually in connection with regulatory action against them. As a result
our future business prospects could deteriorate due to regulatory constraints
 and our profitability could be impaired by our
obligation to provide such indemnification to our employees.

Any
of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and harm our reputation
 business
financial condition and results of operations.

Product
liability claims could divert management&rsquo;s attention from our business
 be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage
awards against us that may not be covered by insurance.

Risks
Relating to Our Common Stock

If
we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls
 we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or
detect fraud. Consequently
 investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and this may decrease the trading price
of our Common Stock.

We
must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and detect fraud. We are in the process of evaluating
changes to internal controls for our new public company status but have not yet implemented changes. Failure to implement changes
to our internal controls or any other factors that we identify as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls
could harm our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our business
 operations or reported financial information.
Any such inability to establish effective controls or loss of confidence would have an adverse effect on our company and could
adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.

The
price of our Common Stock may be volatile and may be influenced by numerous factors
 some of which are beyond our control.

Factors
that could cause volatility in the market price of our Common Stock include
 but are not limited to:



    
    
actual
    or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results; 

    
    
    

    
    
actual
    or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; 

    
    
    

    
    
commercial
    success and market acceptance of our products; 

    
    
    

    
    
success
    of our competitors in commercializing products; 

    
    
    

    
    
strategic
    transactions undertaken by us; 

    
    
    

    
    
additions
    or departures of key personnel; 

    
    
    

    
    
product
    liability claims; 

    
    
    

    
    
prevailing
    economic conditions; 

    
    
    

    
    
disputes
    concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; 

    
    
    

    
    
U.S.
    or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry; 

    
    
    

    
    
sales
    of our Common Stock by our officers
 directors or significant stockholders; 



    
    




    
    
future
    sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us; 

    
    
    

    
    
business
    disruptions caused by natural disasters; and 

    
    
    

    
    
issuance
    of new or changed securities analysts&rsquo; reports or recommendations regarding us. 


In
addition
 the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that have been often unrelated to the operating performance
of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our Common Stock. In the past
when the price of a stock has been volatile
 holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation
against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us
 we could incur substantial costs defending
the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging
growth companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company
&rdquo; as defined in the JOBS Act
 and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various
reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &ldquo;emerging growth companies
&rdquo; including
not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements
of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not
previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.
If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active trading market for our Common
Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

In
addition
 Section 102 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended
 or the Securities Act
 for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. An &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; can therefore delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the
benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that
comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

You
may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock or
preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock or preferred stock.

If
our existing stockholders convert our Series A Stock or exercise Warrants or sell
 or indicate an intention to sell
 substantial
amounts of our Common Stock in the public market
 the price of our Common Stock could decline. The perception in the market that
these sales may occur could also cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.

In
the future
 we may issue authorized but previously unissued equity securities
 resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests
of the then current stockholders. We are authorized to issue an aggregate of 100
000
000 shares of common stock and 5
000
000
shares of &ldquo;blank check&rdquo; preferred stock. We may issue additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities that
are convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees
 future acquisitions
future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes
 or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional
shares of our Common Stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. We may need to raise additional
capital in the near future to meet our working capital needs
 and there can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue
additional shares
 warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with these capital raising efforts
 including
at a price (or exercise prices) below the price you paid for your stock.


    
    


There
is currently a limited market for our Common Stock. You may therefore be unable to re-sell shares of our Common Stock at times
and prices that you believe are appropriate.

Our
Common Stock has been quoted on the OTC pink sheets under the symbol &ldquo;BSFC&rdquo; as of February 18
 2020. Currently
 there
is a limited trading market for our Common Stock and a more active market for our Common Stock may never develop. Accordingly
our Common Stock is highly illiquid
 and you may experience difficulty buying and selling shares at times and prices that you
may desire. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTCQB Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices.
Moreover
 the OTC pink sheets is not a stock exchange
 and trading of securities is often more sporadic than the trading of securities
listed on a quotation system like Nasdaq or a national stock exchange.

Our
Common Stock may be deemed a &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; which may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.

Rule
15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a &ldquo;penny stock
&rdquo; for the purposes relevant to us
 as any
equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject
to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
 the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer
approve a person&rsquo;s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written
agreement to the transaction
 setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.

In
order to approve a person&rsquo;s account for transactions in penny stocks
 the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information
and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks
are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating
the risks of transactions in penny stocks.

The
broker or dealer must also deliver
 prior to any transaction in a penny stock
 a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating
to the penny stock market
 which
 in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability
determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed
 written agreement from the investor prior to the
transaction. Generally
 brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo;
rules. If our Common Stock is or becomes subject to the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules
 it may be more difficult for investors
to dispose of our Common Stock and cause a decline in the market value of our Common Stock.

Disclosure
also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about commissions
payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative
 current quotations for the securities and the rights and
remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally
 monthly statements have to be sent disclosing
recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks

The
sales practice requirements of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) may limit a stockholder&rsquo;s
ability to buy and sell our Common Stock.

FINRA
has adopted rules requiring that
 in recommending an investment to a customer
 a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for
believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their
non-institutional customers
 broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&rsquo;s financial
status
 tax status
 investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules
 FINRA has indicated its
belief that there is a high probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers.
If these FINRA requirements are applicable to us or our securities
 they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend
that at least some of their customers buy our Common Stock
 which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our
Common Stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our Common Stock.


    
    


Our
operating results for a particular period may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities
analysts
 each of which may cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate or decline.

We
expect our operating results to be subject to fluctuations. Our operating results will be affected by numerous factors
 including:



    
    
variations
    in the level of expenses related to future development plans; 

    
    
    

    
    
fluctuations
    in value of the underlying commodity;

    
    
    

    
    
inability
    to procure sufficient quantities to meet demand due to the scarcity of the product available from its suppliers;

    
    
    

    
    
level
    of underlying demand for our products and any other products we sell; 

    
    
    

    
    
any
    intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition
 interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved;
    and 

    
    
    

    
    
regulatory
    developments affecting us or our competitors. 


If
our operating results for a particular period fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts
 the price of our
Common Stock could decline substantially. Furthermore
 any fluctuations in our operating results may
 in turn
 cause the price
of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that comparisons of our financial results from various reporting periods
are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance

Our
principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our Common Stock and will be able to exercise significant
influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.

As
of the date of this filing
 our executive officers
 directors and principal stockholders
 together with their respective affiliates
owned approximately 85.4% of our Common Stock
 including shares subject to outstanding options that are exercisable within 60
days after such date. Accordingly
 these stockholders will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management
and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval
 including the election of our board of directors and approval of
significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of entrenching our management and/or
the board of directors
 delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting
to obtain control of us
 which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the fair market value of our Common Stock.

Because
we became a reporting company under the Exchange Act by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering
 we
may not be able to attract the attention of research analysts at major brokerage firms.

Because
we did not become a reporting company by conducting an underwritten initial public offering of our Common Stock
 and because we
will not be listed on a national securities exchange
 securities analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our company.
In addition
 investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite secondary offerings on our behalf than they might if we
became a public reporting company by means of an underwritten initial public offering
 because they may be less familiar with
our company as a result of more limited coverage by analysts and the media
 and because we became public at an early stage in
our development. The failure to receive research coverage or support in the market for our shares will have an adverse effect
on our ability to develop a liquid market for our Common Stock.

Because
the Merger was a reverse merger
 certain SEC rules may be more restrictive.

Additional
risks may exist as a result of our becoming a public reporting company through a &ldquo;reverse merger.&rdquo; Certain SEC rules
are more restrictive when applied to reverse merger companies
 such as the ability of stockholders to re-sell their shares of
Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144.


    
    


The
resale of shares covered by the Company&rsquo;s registration statement could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock
in the public market
 should one develop
 which result would in turn negatively affect our ability to raise additional equity
capital.

The
sale
 or availability for sale
 of our Common Stock in the public market may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our
Common Stock and may impair our ability to raise additional capital by selling equity or equity-linked securities. We have registered
with the SEC for resale an aggregate of 17
074
750 shares of Common Stock issued and/or issuable in connection with the Merger
the Offering
 the Company Settlement and the shares retained by the pre-Merger shareholders. The Registration Statement permits
the resale of these shares at any time. The resale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market
could adversely affect the market price for our Common Stock and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Common Stock
at times and prices that you feel are appropriate. Furthermore
 because there are a large number of shares registered pursuant
to the Registration Statement
 selling stockholders will continue to offer shares covered by such Registration Statement for a
significant period of time
 the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly
 the adverse market and price pressures
resulting from an offering pursuant to the Registration Statement may continue for an extended period of time and continued negative
pressure on the market price of our Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional equity
capital.

Issuance
of stock to fund our operations may dilute your investment and reduce your equity interest.

We
may need to raise capital in the future to fund the development of our seafood business. Any equity financing may have significant
dilutive effect to stockholders and a material decrease in our stockholders&rsquo; equity interest in us. Equity financing
 if
obtained
 could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. At its sole discretion
 our board of directors may
issue additional securities without seeking stockholder approval
 and we do not know when we will need additional capital or
if we do
 whether it will be available to us.

Provisions
of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company
 even if such an acquisition would
be beneficial to our stockholders
 which could make it more difficult for you to change management.

Provisions
in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage
 delay or prevent a merger
 acquisition or other change in control
that stockholders may consider favorable
 including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their
shares. In addition
 these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current
management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:



    
    
no
    cumulative voting in the election of directors; 

    
    
    

    
    
the
    exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors
    or the resignation
 death or removal of a director; 

    
    
    

    
    
a
    requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors; 

    
    
    

    
    
a
    notice provision requirement for stockholders to nominate directors;

    
    
    

    
    
a
    requirement that our directors may be removed only by a supermajority (two-thirds) vote of the stockholders; and 

    
    
    

    
    
the
    authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine. 


In
addition
 Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested
stockholder
 generally a person who
 together with its affiliates
 owns
 or within the last three years has owned
 15% or more
of our voting stock
 for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder
unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly
 Delaware law may discourage
 delay or prevent
a change in control of the company. Furthermore
 our certificate of incorporation will specify that the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders.
We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly
experienced in resolving corporate disputes
 efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other
forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However
 the provision may have the effect of discouraging
lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies&rsquo;
certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings
 and it is possible that
 in connection with any applicable
action brought against us
 a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation to
be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.


    
    


We
do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future; therefore
 capital appreciation
 if
any
 of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.

We
have never declared or paid cash dividends on our Common Stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock
in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and
growth of our business. In addition
 our current loan and security agreement with ACF contains

if any

 terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our Common Stock. As
a result

Risks
Related to COVID-19

We
may experience disruptions of or restrictions on our operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The
current outbreak of COVID-19 could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations
 including disruptions or restrictions
on our ability to travel or to distribute our seafood products
 as well as temporary closures of our facilities. Any such disruption
or delay would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition
 COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis
that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many other countries
 resulting in an economic downturn that
could affect demand for our products and significantly impact our operating results.

As
the result of current restrictions put in place to address COVID-19
 we have had limited access to our corporate offices
and our corporate staff has been required to work remotely
 disrupting interactions among our staff
 with our customers
and suppliers
 and with our accountants
 consultants and advisors. The extent to which our results may continue to be affected
by COVID-19 will largely depend on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted
 including the duration and scope
of the pandemic
 governmental and business responses to the pandemic and the impact on the global economy
 our customers&rsquo;
demand for our products
 and our ability to provide our products and access our offices and facilities. While these factors
are uncertain
 the COVID-19 pandemic or the perception of its effects could continue to have a material adverse effect on our
business
 financial condition
 results of operations
 or cash flows.

Recent
Developments

We
were incorporated on October 17
 2017 in the State of Delaware as a blank check company to be used as a vehicle to pursue a business
combination with an unidentified target. Since inception
 and prior to the Merger
 we only engaged in organizational efforts.

On
November 8
 2018
 we consummated the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement by and among the Company
 Acquisition
Sub
 Keeler &amp; Co and the Blue Star Stockholder. As a result of the Merger
 effective as of November 8
 2018
 Acquisition Sub
merged with and into Keeler &amp; Co
 and Keeler &amp; Co became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

In
connection with the Merger
 the Company changed its name from &ldquo;AG Acquisition Group II
 Inc.&rdquo; to &ldquo;Blue Star
Foods Corp.&rdquo; and succeeded to the business of Keeler &amp; Co.


    
    


As
a result of the Merger and the related change in our business and operations
 a discussion of our past financial results is not
pertinent
 and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of Keeler &amp; Co
 the accounting acquirer
prior to the Merger are considered the historical financial results of the Company.

On
November 26
 2019
 Keeler &amp; Co entered into the Coastal Pride Merger Agreement. As a result
 Coastal Pride became our indirect
operating subsidiary.

The
current outbreak of COVID-19 could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations
 including disruptions or restrictions
on our ability to travel or to distribute our seafood products
 as well as temporary closures of our facilities. Any such disruption
or delay would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition
 COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis
that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many other countries
 resulting in an economic downturn that
could affect demand for our products and significantly impact our operating results. As a result of COVID-19
 in the current
year to date
 the Company has experienced a significant decrease in revenue as compared to the prior period in 2019. In an effort
to contain costs
 the Company has taken steps to reduce its overhead
 including by a reduction of personnel and warehousing expenses.

As
a result of the business interruption experienced to date
 management has taken steps to reduce expenses across all areas of its
operations
 including payroll
 marketing
 sales and warehousing expenses The extent to which we are affected by COVID-19 will
largely depend on future developments and restrictions which may disrupt interactions with customers
 suppliers
 staff and advisors
which cannot be accurately predicted
 including the duration and scope of the pandemic
 governmental and business responses to
the pandemic and the impact on the global economy
 our customers&rsquo; demand for our products
 and our ability to provide our
products. While these factors are uncertain
 the COVID-19 pandemic or the perception of its effects could continue to have a material
adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations
 or cash flows.

The
audited financial statements for our fiscal years ended December 31
 2019 include a summary of our significant accounting policies
and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management
 all material adjustments necessary
to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements. All such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

Results
of Operations

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon
 and should be
read in conjunction with
 the audited financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Year
Ended December 31
 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31
 2018

Net
Sales. 
 2019 decreased 25.9% to $23
829
463 as compared to $32
165
933 for
the twelve months ended December 31
 2018. The revenue decrease reflects the Company&rsquo;s exit from the private label business
that accounted for 18% of poundage sold for the 12 months ending December 31
 2019 as compared to 37% for the same period in 2018.
The company&rsquo;s Blue Star and other brands poundage were consistent with the prior year. Also contributing to the reduction
in revenue
 was a reduction in the commodity value with the average price per pound decreasing by 8% for 2019 as compared to the
average price per pound in 2018.

Cost
of Goods Sold.
 2019 decreased to $20
610
000 as compared to $27
227
664
for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018. The decrease is primarily attributable to the revenue decline.

Gross
Profit
 2019 decreased $1
718
806 to $3
219
463 from $4
938
269 for
the twelve months ended December 31
 2018. This decrease is attributable to decreased revenues as well as a tightening of profit
margin that occurs as the commodity begins a deflation cycle.


    
    


Gross
Profit Margin
 2019 decreased by 1.9% as compared to 15.4% for the twelve months ended
December 31
 2018. This reduction is attributable to a tightening of the margin as the commodity prices begin a period of contraction.

Commissions
Expenses. 
240 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018 to $106
671 for the twelve-month
period ended December 31
 2019. The decrease is attributable to lower commissionable revenues.

Salaries
&amp; Wages Expense
302
864 to $3
897
541 for the twelve months ending December 31
 2019
as compared to $2
594
677 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018. The increase can be directly attributed to stock-based
compensation related to the completion of the amortization of options issued to an officer in the twelve months ended December
31
 2018
 and the issuance of options to employees as well as stock grants to employees. The expense related to the stock-based
compensation in the twelve months ended December 31
 2019 was $2
262
322 as compared to $808
338 for the twelve months ended December
31
 2018. Cash payment for salaries and wages decreased by $163
171 for the twelve months ending December 31
 2019.

Settlement
&amp; Warrant Expenses. 
 2019
 there were no settlement and warrant expenses as compared
to $769
353 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018.

Other
Operating Expense. 
149 from $2
709
009 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018
to $3
168
158 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to a settlement with a supplier
of $388
199 that occurred in the twelve months ended December 31
 2018.
. However
 expenses paid related to service providers
increased from approximately $826
100 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018 to approximately $1
116
400 for the twelve
months ended December 31
 2019
 primarily due to legal and investment banking fees for private placement and merger related activities.
These costs include $397
000 and $530
000 paid in stock for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019 and December 31
 2018
 respectively.

Interest
Expense. 
009
106 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018 to $1
068
796 for the twelve
months ending December 31
 2019. This increase is attributable to related party notes of $1
100
000 borrowed during the twelve
months ended December 31
 2019 with total interest paid on such notes of $174
600. Additionally
 interest paid to ACF decreased
15.3% from $817
500 during the twelve months ended December 31
 2018 to $692
400 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019

Net
Income/(Loss). 
021
703 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019 as compared to
the net loss of $2
277
116 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018. The increased loss can be primarily attributed to the
decrease in revenue
 and margin percentage
 combined with the increased non-cash costs related to stock incentives
 during the
twelve months ending December 31
 2019.

Cash
Provided by Operating Activities. 
 2019 was
$1
577
164 as compared to cash provided of $3
641
738 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018
 representing a decrease of
$2
064
574. The decrease is attributable to an increase in the net loss of $2
744
587 for the twelve months ended December 31
2019. This is offset by a $1
078
012 increase in non-cash expenses for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019 as compared to
twelve months ended December 31
 2018. Cash generated from Accounts Receivable for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019 increased
$1
633
345 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31
 2018
 while cash generated from inventory decreased $3
416
443
from $5
220
684 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2108 to $1
804
241 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019. Cash
used in Accounts Payable activities decreased from $1
001
820 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018 to $457
576 for the
twelve months ended December 31
 2109. The Company used $146
316 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2109 in advances from
an affiliated supplier as compared to usage of $1
139
619 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018.

Cash
Used in Investing Activities. 
 2019 was $269
705
as compared to $26
681 cash used for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018. The Company utilized $260
667 during the twelve
months ending December 31
 2019 to complete the Coastal Pride acquisition.


    
    


Cash
Used in Financing Activities. 
 2019 was $1
509
015
as compared to cash used in financing activities of $3
288
084 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018. The primary use
of cash was a reduction in the outstanding line of credit of $2
447
649 as of December 31
 2019
 as compared to a decrease of
$3
905
425 as of December 31
 2018. The Company also received $972
500 in net proceeds from Related Party Notes Payable for the
twelve months ended December 31
 2019 as compared to $0 in the twelve months ended December 31
 2018.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

The
Company had cash of $195
810 as of December 31
 2019
 of which $41
906 was restricted cash. At December 31
 2019
 the Company
had a working capital deficit of $2
786
086 including $2
910
136 in stockholder loans that are subordinated to ACF as compared
to a working capital deficit of $1
146
937 at December 31
 2018
 also including $2
910
136 in stockholder loans. The Company&rsquo;s
primary sources of liquidity consisted of inventory of $7
984
492 and accounts receivable of $2
071
363 at December 31
 2019.
The decrease in working capital was due primarily to a decrease of inventory of $142
142 and accounts receivable of $1
378
124
an the increase of Accounts Payable of $372
725 and Related Party notes payable of $972
500 as opposed to a decrease in the working
capital line of credit of $1
285
757.

The
Company has historically financed its operations through the cash flow generated from operations
 loans from John Keeler and other
related parties as well as a working capital line of credit and the sale of equity in private offerings.

The
COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak
continues to evolve
 is highly uncertain and subject to change. The Company is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19
outbreak on its operations or financial condition in the next 12 months. However
 while significant uncertainty remains
 the Company
believes that the COVID-19 outbreak may have a negative impact the ability to raise financing and access capital.

Working
Capital Line of Credit 

The
Company entered into a $14
000
000 revolving line of credit with ACF Finco I
 LP (&ldquo;ACF&rdquo;) on August 31
 2016
 the proceeds
of which were used to pay off the prior line of credit
 pay new loan costs of approximately $309
000 and provide additional working
capital to the Company. This facility was amended on November 18
 2016
 June 19
 2017
 October 16
 2017
 September 19
 2018
 November
8
 2018
 July 29
 2019
 and November 26
 2019 and is secured by all of the assets of Keeler &amp; Co. The line of credit bears
interest at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the 3-month LIBOR rate plus 9.25%
 (ii) the prime rate plus 6.0%
 and (iii) a fixed
rate of 6.5%. As of December 31
 2019
 the line of credit bears interest rate of 11.164%. During the year ended December 31
 2019
the Company failed to meet certain financial covenants.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Variable
Interest Entity

Under
Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standard Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 810
 
when a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (&ldquo;VIE&rdquo;)
 as defined
in ASC 810
 the VIE must be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner
is the primary beneficiary of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights
 obligations
and economic interests of each interest holder in the VIE.

The
Company evaluates its interests in VIE&rsquo;s on an ongoing basis and consolidates any VIE in which it has a controlling financial
interest and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest has both of the following characteristics:
(i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (ii) the obligation
to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to it or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could
be significant to the VIE.

Effective
April 1
 2014
 the Company&rsquo;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. (&ldquo;Strike&rdquo;)
a related party entity which holds the Company&rsquo;s inventory on consignment in United Kingdom (see Note 3). The Company evaluated
its interest in Strike and determined that Strike is a VIE due to the Company&rsquo;s implicit interest in Strike and the fact
that Strike and the Company were under common control after the transfer of the controlling interest. Moreover
 the Company determined
that it is the primary beneficiary of Strike due to the fact that the Company had both the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact Strike and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Strike. Therefore
the Company consolidated Strike in its financial statements.


    
    


Strike&rsquo;s
activities are reflected in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements starting on April 1
 2014
 the effective date of the controlling
interest transfer. Strike&rsquo;s equity is classified as non-controlling interest in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements
since the Company is not a shareholder of Strike. Strike was not a VIE of the Company and the Company was not the primary beneficiary
of Strike prior to the controlling interest transfer.

The
Company also evaluated its interest in three related party entities that are under common control with the Company
 Bacolod
 Bicol
Blue Star Export Co. (&ldquo;Bicol&rdquo;) and John Keeler Real Estate Holding (&ldquo;JK Real Estate&rdquo;)
 in light of ASC
810. The Company purchased inventory from Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company purchased
inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate
 a landlord that
is a related party through common family beneficial ownership.

The
Company determined that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&rsquo;s as they do not meet the criteria to be considered a VIE per ASC
810. The Company does not directly or indirectly absorb any variability of Bacolod or Bicol. The relationship between the Company
and Bacolod and Bicol is strictly a supplier/customer relationship. Moreover
 Bacolod and Bicol have other customers besides the
Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&rsquo;s customer
 they would be able to sustain their operations from
selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company concluded that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&rsquo;s and the
Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary
 Bacolod or Bicol is not consolidated with the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.

The
Company determined that JK Real Estate is a VIE due the fact that the Company guarantees the mortgage on the facility rented from
JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK Real Estate&rsquo;s equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance
its activities without subordinated financial support. Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted
on behalf of the Company&rsquo;s stockholder. The Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate since
the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK Real
Estate is not consolidated with the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.



Substantially
all of the Company&rsquo;s inventory consists of packaged crab meat located at the Company&rsquo;s warehouse facility as well
as public cold storage facilities and merchandise in transit from suppliers. The cost of inventory is primarily determined using
the specific identification method. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method.

Merchandise
is purchased cost and freight shipping point and becomes the Company&rsquo;s asset and liability upon leaving the suppliers&rsquo;
warehouse. The Company had in-transit inventory of approximately $1
958
600 and $4
203
400 as of December 31
 2019 and December
31
 2018
 respectively.

The
Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and records an allowance to reduce the carrying value of inventory
to the lower of cost or market based on its assessment of market conditions
 inventory turnover and current stock levels. Inventory
write-downs are charged to cost of goods sold. The Company recorded an inventory allowance of approximately $40
784 for the year
ended December 31
 2019 as compared to $39
300 for the year ended December 31
 2018.

Advances
to Suppliers and Related Party

In
the normal course of business
 the Company may advance payments to its suppliers
 including Bacolod
 a related party. These advances
are in the form of prepayments for products that will ship within a short window of time. In the event that it becomes necessary
for the Company to return products or adjust for quality issues
 the Company is issued a credit by the vendor in the normal course
of business and these credits are also reflected against future shipments.


    
    


As
of December 31
 2019 and December 31
 2018
 the balance due from Bacolod for future shipments was approximately $1
286
000 and
$1
139
619
 respectively. The 2019 balance represents approximately five to six months of purchases from the supplier.

Revenue
Recognition

Effective
with the January 1
 2018 adoption of ASU 2014-09
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&rdquo; and the associated
ASUs (collectively
 &ldquo;Topic 606&rdquo;)
 the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods
or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
To determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company
performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the
contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

The
Company elected an accounting policy to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities. Consideration payable
to a customer is recorded as a reduction of the arrangement&rsquo;s transaction price
 thereby reducing the amount of revenue
recognized
 unless the payment is for distinct goods or services received from the customer.

Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

ASC
842 Leases

On
January 1
 2019
 we adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842 and all the related amendments using the modified retrospective
method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard as an adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the lease accounting
standard in effect for those periods.

The
new lease standard requires all leases to be reported on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease obligations. We elected
the practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance of the new standard that retained the lease classification and
initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to adoption of the standard. We did not reassess whether any contracts
entered into prior to adoption are leases or contain leases.

We
categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally
those leases that would allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired
under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment
 net. All other leases are categorized as operating leases. We did
not have any finance leases as of December 31
 2019. Our leases generally have terms that range from three years for equipment
and five to twenty years for property. We elected the accounting policy to include both the lease and non-lease components of
our agreements as a single component and account for them as a lease.

Lease
liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings
available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments
 reduced by landlord
incentives
 plus any direct costs from executing the leases. Lease assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived
assets used in operations. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful
life or the lease term.

When
we have the option to extend the lease term
 terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date
 or purchase the leased
asset
 and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In
December 2019
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (&ldquo;ASU
2019-12&rdquo;)
 which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain
exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2020
with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements
and related disclosure.

ITEM
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA



REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Blue
Star Foods Corp

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Blue Star Foods Corp and its subsidiaries (collectively
 the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; deficit
 and cash
flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In
our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December
31
 2019 and 2018
 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Going
Concern Matter

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements
 the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency
that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&quot;PCAOB&quot;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We
have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.

 the net liabilities existing in the company as of the
date of the merger totaling approximately $2
400 were converted to equity as part of this transaction. The prior owners of Blue
Star Foods Corp. received 750
000 shares of common stock as part of this transaction
 and various service providers received 265
000
shares as compensation for their work on the transaction resulting in and expense and additional paid in capital of $530
001.
Additionally
 there were 725 Series A Preferred shares and 181
250 warrants issued to private placement investors for total capital
contribution of $725
000
 688 Series A Preferred shares and 172
000 warrants issued for settlement with prior investors which
had a fair value of $688
000 and $81
353 respectively. Lastly
 upon the close of the merger there were 3
120
000 options to purchase
common stock issued to Christopher Constable. Additionally
 Carlos Faria held options to purchase 104 shares of John Keeler &amp;
Co.
 Inc. prior to the merger. These options were immediately converted at closing to 3
120
000 options to purchase common stock
in Blue Star Foods Corp.

The
Merger was accounted for as a &ldquo;reverse merger&rdquo; and recapitalization since
 immediately following the completion of
the transaction
 the holders of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.&rsquo;s stock will have effective control of Blue Star Foods Corp.
In addition
 John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. will have control of the combined entity through control of the Board by designating
all four of the board seats. Additionally
 all of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.&rsquo;s officers and senior executive positions
continued as management of the combined entity after consummation of the Merger. For accounting purposes
 John Keeler &amp; Co.
Inc. was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and
 consequently
 the transaction has been treated as a recapitalization
of Blue Star Foods Corp. Accordingly
 John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.&rsquo;s assets
 liabilities and results of operations are the
historical financial statements of the registrant
 and the John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.&rsquo;s assets
 liabilities and results
of operations have been consolidated with Blue Star Foods Corp effective as of the date of the closing of the Merger. No step-up
in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction.

On
November 26
 2019
 John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.
 a Florida corporation (the &ldquo;Purchaser&rdquo;)
 and wholly-owned direct subsidiary
of the Company
 entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &ldquo;Coastal Merger Agreement&rdquo;) with
Coastal Pride Company
 Inc.
 a South Carolina corporation (&ldquo;Coastal Pride&rdquo;)
 Coastal Pride Seafood
 LLC
 a Florida
limited liability company and newly-formed
 wholly-owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (the &ldquo;Acquisition Subsidiary&rdquo;
and
 upon the effective date of the Merger
 the &ldquo;Surviving Company)
 and The Walter F. Lubkin
 Jr. Irrevocable Trust dated
1/8/03 (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;)
 Walter F. Lubkin III (&ldquo;Lubkin III&rdquo;)
 Tracy Lubkin Greco (&ldquo;Greco&rdquo;) and
John C. Lubkin (&ldquo;Lubkin&rdquo;)
 constituting all of the shareholders of Coastal Pride immediately prior to the Coastal
Merger (collectively
 the &ldquo;Sellers&rdquo;). Pursuant to the terms of the Coastal Merger Agreement
 Coastal Pride merged
with and into the Acquisition Subsidiary
 with the Acquisition Subsidiary being the surviving company (the &ldquo;Merger&rdquo;).



    
    


Coastal
Pride is a seafood company
 based in Beaufort
 South Carolina
 that imports pasteurized and fresh crabmeat sourced primarily from
Mexico and Latin America and sells premium branded label crabmeat throughout North America. 



Basis
of Presentation:

The
accompanying financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;).

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
 John Keeler &amp; Co
 Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary
 Coastal
Pride Seafood
 LLC
 a wholly owned subsidiary of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. and its variable interest entity for which the John
Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Variable
Interest Entity

Under
Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standard Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 810
 
when a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (&ldquo;VIE&rdquo;)
 as defined
in ASC 810
 the VIE must be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner
is the primary beneficiary of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights
 obligations
and economic interests of each interest holder in the VIE.

The
Company evaluates its interests in VIE&rsquo;s on an ongoing basis and consolidates any VIE in which it has a controlling financial
interest and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest has both of the following characteristics:
(i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (ii) the obligation
to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to it or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could
be significant to the VIE.

Effective
April 1
 2014
 the Company&rsquo;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. (&ldquo;Strike&rdquo;)
a related party entity which holds the Company&rsquo;s inventory on consignment in United Kingdom (see Note 3). The Company evaluated
its interest in Strike and determined that Strike is a VIE due to the Company&rsquo;s implicit interest in Strike and the fact
that Strike and the Company were under common control after the transfer of the controlling interest. Moreover
 the Company determined
that it is the primary beneficiary of Strike due to the fact that the Company had both the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact Strike and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Strike. Therefore
the Company consolidated Strike in its financial statements.


    
    


Strike&rsquo;s
activities are reflected in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements starting on April 1
 2014
 the effective date of the controlling
interest transfer. Strike&rsquo;s equity is classified as non-controlling interest in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements
since the Company is not a shareholder of Strike. Strike was not a VIE of the Company and the Company was not the primary beneficiary
of Strike prior to the controlling interest transfer.

The
Company also evaluated its interest in three related party entities that are under common control with the Company
 Bacolod Blue
Star Export Corp. (&ldquo;Bacolod&rdquo;)
 Bicol Blue Star Export Co. (&ldquo;Bicol&rdquo;) and John Keeler Real Estate Holding
(&ldquo;JK Real Estate&rdquo;)
 in light of ASC 810. The Company purchases inventory from Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized
crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company purchased inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and
warehouse facility from JK Real Estate
 a landlord that is a related party through common family beneficial ownership (see Note
7).

The
Company determined that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&rsquo;s as they do not meet the criteria to be considered a VIE per ASC
810. The Company does not directly or indirectly absorb any variability of Bacolod or Bicol. The relationship between the Company
 accounting
policy). Moreover
 Bacolod and Bicol have other customers besides the Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&rsquo;s
customer
 they would be able to sustain their operations from selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company
concluded that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&rsquo;s and the Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary
 Bacolod or Bicol
is not consolidated with the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.

The
Company determined that JK Real Estate is a VIE due the fact that the Company guarantees the mortgage on the facility rented from
JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK Real Estate&rsquo;s equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance
its activities without subordinated financial support. Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted
on behalf of the Company&rsquo;s majority stockholder. The Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate
since the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK
Real Estate is not consolidated with the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.

Cash
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

On
January 1
 2018 the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18
 &ldquo;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash&rdquo;

 
total of cash and cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash.

The
Company maintains cash balances with financial institutions in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Company (&ldquo;FDIC&rdquo;)
insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts and believes it does not have a significant exposure.

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


    
    


The
Company considers any cash balance in the lender designated cash collateral account as restricted cash. All cash proceeds must
be deposited into cash collateral account
 and will be cleared and applied to the line of credit. The Company has no access to
this account
 and the purpose of the funds is restricted to repayment of the line of credit. The following table provides a reconciliation
of cash
 cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same
such amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows:

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable consist of unsecured obligations due from customers under normal trade terms
 usually net 30 days. The Company grants
credit to its customers based on the Company&rsquo;s evaluation of a particular customer&rsquo;s credit worthiness.

Allowances
for doubtful accounts are maintained for potential credit losses based on the age of the accounts receivable and the results of
the Company&rsquo;s periodic credit evaluations of its customers&rsquo; financial condition. Receivables are written off as uncollectible
and deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts after collection efforts have been deemed to be unsuccessful. Subsequent
recoveries are netted against the provision for doubtful accounts expense. The Company generally does not charge interest on receivables.

Receivables
are net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and sales return and allowances. They are stated at estimated net realizable
value. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company recorded sales return and allowances and refund liability of approximately
$59
100 and $159
500
 respectively. There was no allowance for bad debt recorded during the years ended December 31
 2019 and
2018.



Substantially
all of the Company&rsquo;s inventory consists of packaged crab meat located at the Company&rsquo;s warehouse facility as well
as public cold storage facilities and merchandise in transit from suppliers. The cost of inventory is primarily determined using
the specific identification method. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method.

Merchandise
is purchased cost and freight shipping point and becomes the Company&rsquo;s asset and liability upon leaving the suppliers&rsquo;
warehouse. The Company had in-transit inventory of approximately $1
958
553 and $4
203
400 as of December 31
 2019 and December
31
 2018
 respectively.

The
Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and records an allowance to reduce the carrying value of inventory
to the lower of cost or market based on its assessment of market conditions
 inventory turnover and current stock levels. Inventory
write-downs are charged to cost of goods sold. The Company recorded an inventory allowance of approximately $40
800 and $39
300
for the years ended December 31
 2019 and December 31
 2018.


    
    


Advances
to Suppliers and Related Party

In
the normal course of business
 the Company may advance payments to its suppliers
 inclusive of Bacolod
 a related party. These
advances are in the form of prepayments for products that will ship within a short window of time. In the event that it becomes
necessary for the Company to return products or adjust for quality issues
 the Company is issued a credit by the vendor in the
normal course of business and these credits are also reflected against future shipments.

As
of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the balance due from the related party for future shipments was approximately $1
285
900 and $1
139
600
respectively. The 2019 balances represent approximately five to six months of purchases from the supplier.

Fixed
Assets

Fixed
assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are being depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the asset as follows:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    


Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected life of the improvement or the remaining
lease term.

The
Company capitalizes expenditures for major improvements and additions and expenses those items which do not improve or extend
the useful life of the fixed assets.

The
Company reviews fixed assets for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. At
December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company believes the carrying values of its long-lived assets are recoverable and as such
 the
Company did not record any impairment.

Other
Comprehensive (loss) Income

The
Company reports its comprehensive (loss) income in accordance with ASC 220
 
 which establishes standards
for reporting and presenting comprehensive (loss) income and its components in a full set of financial statements. Other comprehensive
(loss) income consists of net income (loss) and cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments.

Foreign
Currency Translation

The
Company&rsquo;s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. Dollars. The assets and liabilities held by the Company&rsquo;s
VIE have a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. They are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at
the end of each reporting period. The VIE&rsquo;s revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average rates that
prevailed during the period. The rates used in the financial statements as presented for December 31
 2019 and 2018 were 1.337
and 1.336 US dollar to UK pound sterling
 respectively. The resulting net translation gains and losses are reported as foreign
currency translation adjustments in stockholders&rsquo; equity as a component of comprehensive (loss) income. The Company recorded
foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately $50
100 and ($38
600) for the years ended December 31
 2019 and December
31
 2018
 respectively.


    
    


Revenue
Recognition

Effective
with the January 1
 2018 adoption of ASU 2014-09
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&rdquo; and the associated
ASUs (collectively
 &ldquo;Topic 606&rdquo;)
 the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods
or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
To determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company
performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the
contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

The
Company elected an accounting policy to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities. Consideration payable
to a customer is recorded as a reduction of the arrangement&rsquo;s transaction price
 thereby reducing the amount of revenue
recognized
 unless the payment is for distinct goods or services received from the customer.



The
Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expenses which are included in Other Operating Expenses were
approximately $81
700 and $127
000
 for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Customer
Concentration

The
Company had three customers which accounted for approximately 46% and 65%
 of revenue during the years ended December 31
 2019
and 2018
 respectively. Outstanding receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 24% and 65% of the total accounts
receivable as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact
on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial position.

Supplier
Concentration

The
Company had two suppliers which accounted for approximately 42% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the
year ended December 31
 2019
 and a one-time purchase from a United States based supplier that accounted for approximately
21% of purchases. The two suppliers are located in two countries
 Indonesia
 and the Philippines
 which accounted
for approximately 65% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended December 31
 2019.


    
    


The
Company had three suppliers which accounted for approximately 87% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended
December 31
 2018. These three suppliers are located in two countries
 Indonesia
 and the Philippines
 which accounted for approximately
93% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended December 31
 2018.

These
suppliers included Bacolod
 a related party
 which accounted for approximately 27% and 49% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases
during the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

On
September 20
 2018
 the company entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement with a supplier that the company was engaged
in a commercial dispute. The settlement resulted in a reduction of the outstanding accounts payable to that supplier of $388
199
to a balance due of $1
465
000. The balance due to this supplier as of December 31
 2019 was approximately $927
800.

The
loss of any major supplier could have a material adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
position.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

Our
financial instruments include cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 and debt obligations. We believe
the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate their fair values because they are short term in nature or payable
on demand.

Earnings
or Loss per Share:

The
Company accounts for earnings per share pursuant to ASC 260
 Earnings per Share
 which requires disclosure on the financial statements
of &ldquo;basic&rdquo; and &ldquo;diluted&rdquo; earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing
net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents
(if dilutive) related to stock options and warrants for each year. As further described in Footnote 6 - Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock
 as of December 31
 2019
 1
413 shares of Preferred Stock could be converted into 706
500 shares of common stock. As further
described in Footnote 7 &ndash; Options &amp; Warrants
 as of December 31
 2019
 3
120
000 options may be exercised and 353
250
warrants exercisable.

As
there was a net loss for the years ended December 31
 2019
 basic and diluted losses per share are the same.

Employee
Stock-Based Compensation:

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718
 &ldquo;Compensation-Stock Compensation&rdquo;. ASC 718
requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
 including
stock options
 based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
 usually the vesting period. The Company has elected to adopt
ASU 2016-09 and has a policy to account for forfeitures as they occur.



Effective
January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-07
 Compensation &ndash; Stock Based Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements
to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (&ldquo;ASU 2018-7&rdquo;)
 which aligns accounting for share-based payments issued
to nonemployees to that of employees under the existing guidance of Topic 718
 with certain exceptions. This update supersedes
previous guidance for equity-based payments to nonemployees under Subtopic 505-50
 Equity &ndash; Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.
The adoption of ASU 2018-07 did not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.


    
    


The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with ASU No. 2018-07
 Compensation &ndash;
Stock Based Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (&ldquo;ASU 2018-07&rdquo;)
which aligns accounting for share-based payments issued to nonemployees to that of employees under the existing guidance of Topic
718
 with certain exceptions. This update supersedes previous guidance for equity-based payments to nonemployees under Subtopic
505-50
 Equity &ndash; Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.

All
issuances of stock options or other equity instruments to non-employees as consideration for goods or services received by the
Company are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. Non-employee equity-based payments are recorded
as an expense over the service period
 as if the Company had paid cash for the services. At the end of each financial reporting
period
 prior to vesting or prior to the completion of the services
 the fair value of the equity-based payments will be re-measured
and the non-cash expense recognized during the period will be adjusted accordingly. Since the fair value of equity-based payments
granted to non-employees is subject to change in the future
 the amount of the future expense will include fair value re-measurements
until the equity-based payments are fully vested or the service completed.

Related
Parties:

The
Company accounts for related party transactions in accordance with ASC 850 (&ldquo;Related Party Disclosures&rdquo;). A party
is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries
 controls
is controlled by
 or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company
 its
management
 members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which
the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to
an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest
in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.

As
of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 there was approximately $350
900 and $174
600 in interest paid to related parties notes payable.
See Note 6 Debt and Note 4 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity for further information.



Certain
amounts in prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Income
Taxes

Prior
to November 8
 2018
 the Company was taxed under the provisions of subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these provisions
the Company did not pay corporate federal income taxes on its taxable income but was liable for Florida corporate income taxes
and Texas Franchise Tax. The shareholder was liable for individual income taxes on the Company&rsquo;s taxable income. Post-merger
the Company file consolidated federal and state income tax returns.


    
    


Unaudited
pro forma amounts for income tax expense have been presented assuming the Company&rsquo;s pro forma effective tax rate of (2.56)%
for the year ended December 31
 2018
 as if it had been a C corporation during that period. The pro-forma provision
for income taxes excludes information related to the Company&rsquo;s VIE.

Income
tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases
of assets and liabilities
 computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance
 if needed
 reduces deferred tax assets to
the amount expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted
through the provision for income taxes.

A
tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; that the tax position would be sustained
in a tax examination
 with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo;
test
 no tax benefit is recorded.

The
Company&rsquo;s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in &ldquo;Income tax expense&rdquo; in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no amounts related to interest and penalties recognized for the years ended
December 31
 2019 or 2018.

Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements


ASC
842 Leases

On
January 1
 2019
 we adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842 and all the related amendments using the modified retrospective
method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard as an adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the lease accounting
standard in effect for those periods.

The
new lease standard requires all leases to be reported on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease obligations. We elected
the practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance of the new standard that retained the lease classification and
initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to adoption of the standard. We did not reassess whether any contracts
entered into prior to adoption are leases or contain leases.

We
categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally
those leases that would allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired
under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment
 net. All other leases are categorized as operating leases. We did
not have any finance leases as of December 31
 2019. Our leases generally have terms that range from three years for equipment
and five to twenty years for property. We elected the accounting policy to include both the lease and non-lease components of
our agreements as a single component and account for them as a lease.


    
    




Lease
liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings
available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments
 reduced by landlord
incentives
 plus any direct costs from executing the leases. Lease assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived
assets used in operations. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful
life or the lease term.

When
we have the option to extend the lease term
 terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date
 or purchase the leased
asset
 and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option
 we consider these options in determining the classification
and measurement of the lease. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating
expenses over the term of the lease.

The
table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheets.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In
December 2019
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (&ldquo;ASU
2019-12&rdquo;)
 which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain
exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2020
with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements
and related disclosure.

Note
3. Going Concern

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.
Although the company has positive cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company incurred a net loss
of $5
021
703
 has an accumulated deficit of $8
952
466 and working capital deficit of $2
786
086
 inclusive of $2
910
136
in subordinated stockholder debt. These circumstances raise substantial doubt as to the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as
a going concern. The Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company&rsquo;s ability to increase
revenues
 execute on its business plan to acquire complimentary companies
 raise capital
 and to continue to sustain adequate
working capital to finance its operations. The failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability and cash flows would be
detrimental to the Company. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the
Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Note
4. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

Effective
April 1
 2014
 the Company&rsquo;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike (see Note 2). The Company
concluded that Strike is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary of Strike
 in accordance with ASC 810
.
Therefore
 the Company consolidated Strike in its financial statements. Strike&rsquo;s activities are reflected in the
Company&rsquo;s financial statements starting on April 1
 2014
 the effective date of the controlling interest transfer.
Strike was not a VIE of the Company and the Company was not the primary beneficiary of Strike prior to the effective date of
the controlling interest transfer of April 1
 2014. Strike&rsquo;s equity is classified as non-controlling interest in the
Company&rsquo;s financial statements since the Company is not a shareholder of Strike.


    
    


The
information below represents the assets
 liabilities and non-controlling interest related to Strike as of December 31
 2019 and

In
determining the fair value of the common stock issued
 the Company considered the value of the stock as estimated by the company
at the time of closing. Given that the stock was not trading at the time of closing
 the Company utilized its most sale of common
stock from November
 2018 to November
 2019 of approximately $1
000
000 in the aggregate with a valuation of $2.00 shares of common
stock.


    
    


Inventory
was assessed at the time of closing as to its fair value
 and it was determined that a step-up analysis was necessary in order
to evaluate the fair value of the inventory at the time of closing. The step up represents the net profit that would be attained
when the inventory is sold. The key assumptions used in this analysis is a gross margin of 11.6% and selling costs of 4.4%
 The
analysis resulted in a necessary step up of $105
000 at the time of closing.

Goodwill
represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately
recognized. The goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributable to the value of the potential expanded market opportunity
with new customers. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Under
the Black-Scholes option pricing model
 the fair value of the 705
000 options granted during the twelve months ended December
31
 2019 is estimated at $613
586 on the date of grant. The unrecognized portion of the expense remaining outstanding is $467
232.
During the twelve months ended December 31
 2019
 an aggregate of 15
000 shares subject to options were forfeited
 none of which
shares were vested and resulted in a reversal of the expense of $2

12 Income taxes

In
connection with the Merger
 as discussed in Note 1
 the Company terminated its S-Corporation status and became a taxable entity
(&ldquo;C Corporation&rdquo;) on November 8
 2018. The consolidated statements of income present unaudited pro forma statements
of income for the year to date and for prior year period. The pro-forma provision for income taxes excludes information related
to the Company&rsquo;s VIE.

Tax
periods for all fiscal years after 2015 remain open to examination by the federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which
the Company is subject. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company has federal net operating loss of $1
429
252 to carry forward
indefinitely.

ASC
740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo;
that all
 or a portion of
 deferred tax assets will not be recognized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence
needs to be considered
 including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 and tax
planning strategies. After consideration of all the information available
 management believes that uncertainty exists with respect
to future realization of its deferred tax assets and has
 therefore
 established a full valuation allowance as of December 31
2019.

As
of December 31
 2019
 the Company has evaluated and concluded that there were no material uncertain tax positions requiring
recognition in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements. The Company&rsquo;s policy is to classify assessments
 if any
 for tax
related interest as income tax expenses. No interest or penalties were recorded during the years ended December 31
 2019.



    
    


Note
13. Commitment and Contingencies

Office
lease

The
Company leases its Miami office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate
 a related party through common family beneficial ownership
(see Note 2). The lease has a 20 year term
 expiring in July 2021. The Company is a guarantor of the mortgage on the facility
which had a balance of approximately $1
274
700 at December 31
 2019; the Company&rsquo;s maximum exposure. The Company
deems that rental income on this lease is sufficient to cover the loan payments under this mortgage. Therefore
 the Company did
not record any liability related to the mortgage in the consolidated financial statements as the Company does not believe it will
be called upon to perform under this guarantee
 in accordance with ASC 460
 

The
Company leases approximately 3
000 square feet in Beaufort South Carolina for the offices of Coastal Pride Seafood
 LLC. This
office space consists of two leases with related parties with approximately 6 years remaining on the leases.

See
the disclosure under Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements under ASC 842 Leases regarding the disclosure of the future period
amortizations of the Right of Use assets.

Rental
and equipment lease expenses amounted to approximately $237
400 and $211
000 for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.



The
Company has reached a settlement agreement with a former employee. Although the agreement is not finalized the company has reserved
for the entire amount of the settlement.

Note
14. COVID-19 Pandemic

On
March 11
 2020
 the World Health Organization declared that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) had become a pandemic
 and on March
13
 2020
 the U.S. President declared a National Emergency concerning the disease. Additionally
 in March 2020
 state governments
in the Company&rsquo;s geographic operating area began instituting preventative shut down measures in order to combat the novel
coronavirus pandemic. The coronavirus and actions taken to mitigate the spread of it have had and are expected to continue to
have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of the geographical area in which the Company operates. On March
27
 2020
 the Coronavirus Aid
 Relief
 and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted to amongst other provisions
 provide
emergency assistance for individuals
 families and businesses affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic. The Company&rsquo;s
business not being deemed essential resulted in will result in decreased financial performance that may not be indicative of future
financial results and there remains uncertainty and increased risks concerning its employees
 customers
 supply chain and government
regulation. Going forward sales and supply may continue to be adversely affected due to COVID-19
 via decreased demand and/or
a decreased ability to source adequate product to meet demand.

Note
15. Employee Benefit Plan 

The
Company provides and sponsors a 401(k) plan for its employees. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 no contributions
were made to the plan by the Company.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer
 as of December 31
 2019
 we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined
under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended. Based on this evaluation
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that
 based on the material weaknesses discussed
below
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act were recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms and that our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 or persons
performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by
or under the supervision of
 our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors
management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:



    
    
Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    our assets;

    
    
    

    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that our receipts and expenditures are being
    made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors; and



    
    




    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems
no matter how well designed
 have inherent limitations. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control
 there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
over financial reporting. However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 existing as of December 31
 2019
 based
on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control&mdash;Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;) and SEC guidance on
conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation
 we believe that
 during the period covered by this report
 such internal
controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of GAAP rules as more fully described below.
This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely
affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.

As
a result of the foregoing
 the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material
weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were:



    
    
The
    Company&rsquo;s lack of an audit committee with a financial expert and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within
    the financial reporting process; 

    
    
    

    
    
inadequate
    segregation of duties consistent with control objectives
 including lack of personnel resources and technical accounting expertise
    within the accounting function of the Company.


Management
believes that the material weaknesses that were identified did not have an effect on our financial results. However
 management
believes that these weaknesses
 if not properly remediated
 could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements
in future periods.

Management&rsquo;s
Remediation Initiatives

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls
 we plan to
further initiate
 the following measures
 subject to the availability of required resources:



    
    
We
    plan to establish an audit committee
 including an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert&rdquo; as defined by applicable
    SEC rules
 that has the requisite financial sophistication as defined under the applicable Nasdaq rules and regulations; 

    
    
    

    
    
We
                                         plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and
                                         hire personnel resources with technical accounting expertise within the accounting function;
                                         and
        
We
        plan to hire a chief financial officer as currently the Company&rsquo;s chief executive officer fills the role of the
        Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Until such time
 we have engaged an outside
        accounting consultant with significant experience in the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP
        to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements.
        
        
Going
        forward
 we intend to evaluate our processes and procedures and
 where practicable and resources permit
 implement changes
        in order to have more effective controls over financial reporting.



    
    


This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over
financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to rules of the SEC that exempt smaller reporting companies from this requirement.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth quarter that have materially
affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

investments and real estate holdings. Mr. Herian received his BS in Mechanical Engineering from Florida Atlantic University in
1994 and an Executive M.B.A. from the University of Miami in 2014. Mr. Herian&rsquo;s experience in the food import industry led
to the decision to appoint him to the board of directors. There are no family relationships among our directors and executive
officers.

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who beneficially own more
than 10% percent of our equity securities (&ldquo;Reporting Persons&rdquo;) to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership
with the SEC. Based solely on our review of copies of such reports and representations from the Reporting Persons
 we believe
that during the fiscal year ended December 31
 2019
 the Reporting Persons timely filed all such reports
 except that Nubar Herian
a director
 failed to filed Form 4s reporting dividends paid on an aggregate of 18
000 shares of common stock issued as a common
stock dividend on the Company&rsquo;s 8% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to a company controlled by Mr. Herian.


    
    


Code
of Ethics

We
intend to adopt a code of ethics that applies to our officers
 directors and employees
 including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer
 but have not done so to date due to our relatively small size.

Board
Committees

The
Company has no nominating
 audit or compensation committees at this time. The entire board of directors participates in the nomination
and audit oversight processes and considers executive and director compensation. The entire board of directors is involved in
such decision-making processes. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority
to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We
are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors.

Role
of Board in Risk Oversight Process

Risk
assessment and oversight are an integral part of our governance and management processes. Our board of directors encourages management
to promote a culture that incorporates risk management into our corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations. Management
discusses strategic and operational risks at regular management meetings and conducts strategic planning and review sessions during
the year that include a discussion and analysis of the risks facing us.

Board
Diversity

Upon
consummation of the Merger
 the board of directors will review
 on an annual basis
 the appropriate characteristics
 skills and
experience required for the board of directors as a whole and its individual members. In evaluating the suitability of individual
candidates (both new candidates and current members)
 the board of directors
 in approving (and
 in the case of vacancies
 appointing)
such candidates
 will take into account many factors
 including the following:



    
    
personal
    and professional integrity;

    
    
    

    
    
ethics
    and values;

    
    
    

    
    
experience
    in the industries in which we compete;

    
    
    

    
    
experience
    as a director or executive officer of another publicly held company;

    
    
    

    
    
diversity
    of expertise and experience in substantive matters pertaining to our business relative to other board members;

    
    
    

    
    
conflicts
    of interest; and

    
    
    

    
    
practical
    business judgment.


Shareholder
Communications

We
have not yet established a process for shareholder communications.

Our
executive officers have basic health benefits that are generally available to all of our employees.

We
offer a 401(k) plan to eligible employees
 including our executive officers. In accordance with this plan
 all eligible employees
may contribute a percentage of compensation up to a maximum of the statutory limits per year. We intend for the 401(k) plan to
qualify
 depending on the employee&rsquo;s election
 under Section 401(a) of the Code
 so that contributions by employees
 and
income earned on those contributions
 are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the 401(k) plan.

2018
Equity Incentive Plan

We
have adopted the 2018 Plan that provides for the grant of up to 7
500
000 shares of common stock. Under the 2018 Plan
 we are
authorized to issue incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Code and non-qualified stock options.
The 2018 Plan is administered by our board of directors. In connection with the Merger
 we issued options to purchase an aggregate
of 6
240
000 million shares of common stock to certain executive officers and directors (3
120
000 of which were subsequently
forfeited unexercised).

Share
Reserve
500
000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan pursuant to a variety of stock-based
compensation awards
 including stock options
 stock appreciation rights(&ldquo;SARs&rdquo;)
 restricted stock awards
 restricted
stock unit awards
 deferred stock awards
 dividend equivalent awards
 stock payment awards
 performance awards and other stock-based
awards.

&#9679;
to the extent that an award terminates
 expires or lapses for any reason or an award is settled in cash without the delivery of
shares
 any shares subject to the award at such time will be available for future grants under the 2018 Plan;

&#9679;
to the extent shares are tendered or withheld to satisfy the grant
 exercise price or tax withholding obligation with respect
to any award under the 2018 Plan
 such tendered or withheld shares will be available for future grants under the 2018 Plan;

&#9679;
to the extent that shares of common stock are repurchased by us prior to vesting so that shares are returned to us
 such shares
will be available for future grants under the 2018 Plan;

&#9679;
the payment of dividend equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding awards will not be counted against the shares
available for issuance under the 2018 Plan; and

&#9679;
to the extent permitted by applicable law or any exchange rule
 shares issued in assumption of
 or in substitution for
 any outstanding
awards of any entity acquired in any form of combination by us or any of our subsidiaries will not be counted against the shares
available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.

Administration.

The compensation committee must consist of at least three members of our board of directors
 each of whom is intended to qualify
as an &ldquo;outside director
&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code
 a &ldquo;non-employee director&rdquo;
for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and an &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules.
The 2018 Plan provides that the board of directors or compensation committee may delegate its authority to grant awards to employees
other than executive officers to a committee consisting of one or more members of our board of directors or one or more of our
officers
 other than awards made to our non-employee directors
 which must be approved by our full board of directors.

Subject
to the terms and conditions of the 2018 Plan
 the administrator has the authority to select the persons to whom awards are to
be made
 to determine the number of shares to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards
 and to make all other
determinations and to take all other actions necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2018 Plan. The administrator
is also authorized to adopt
 amend or rescind rules relating to administration of the 2018 Plan. Our board of directors may at
any time remove the compensation committee as the administrator and revest in itself the authority to administer the 2018 Plan.
The full board of directors will administer the 2018 Plan with respect to awards to non-employee directors.

Eligibility.

 SARs
 restricted stock and all other stock-based and cash-based awards under the 2018 Plan may be granted to individuals
who are then our officers
 employees or consultants or are the officers
 employees or consultants of subsidiaries. Such awards
also may be granted to our directors. Only employees of the Company or certain subsidiaries may be granted ISOs.


    
    


Awards.

 SARs
 restricted stock awards
 restricted
stock unit awards
 deferred stock awards
 deferred stock unit awards
 dividend equivalent awards
 performance awards
 stock payment
awards and other stock-based and cash-based awards
 or any combination thereof. Each award will be set forth in a separate agreement
with the person receiving the award and will indicate the type
 terms and conditions of the award.

Nonstatutory
Stock Options (&ldquo;NSOs&rdquo;)
may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant
 and usually will become exercisable
(at the discretion of the administrator) in one or more installments after the grant date
 subject to the participant&rsquo;s
continued employment or service with us and/or subject to the satisfaction of corporate performance targets and individual performance
targets established by the administrator. NSOs may be granted for any term specified by the administrator that does not exceed
10 years.

Incentive
Stock Options (&ldquo;ISOs&rdquo;)
Code and will be subject to specified restrictions contained in the Code. Among such restrictions
 ISOs must have an exercise
price of not less than the fair market value of a share of our Common Stock on the date of grant
 may only be granted to employees
and must not be exercisable after a period of 10 years measured from the date of grant. In the case of an ISO granted to an individual
who owns (or is deemed to own) at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our capital stock
 the 2018 Plan
provides that the exercise price must be at least 110% of the fair market value of a share of our Common Stock on the date of
grant and the ISO must not be exercisable after a period of five years measured from the date of grant.

Restricted
Stock Awards 
Restricted stock
 typically
 may be forfeited for no consideration or repurchased by us at the original purchase price if the
conditions or restrictions on vesting are not met. In general
 restricted stock may not be sold or otherwise transferred until
restrictions are removed or expire. Purchasers of restricted stock
 unlike recipients of options
 will have voting rights and
will have the right to receive dividends
 if any
 prior to the time when the restrictions lapse; however
 extraordinary dividends
will generally be placed in escrow
 and will not be released until restrictions are removed or expire.

Restricted
Stock Unit Awards
 typically without payment of consideration
 but subject to vesting
conditions based on continued employment or service or on performance criteria established by the administrator. Like restricted
stock
 restricted stock units may not be sold
 or otherwise transferred or hypothecated
 until vesting conditions are removed
or expire. Unlike restricted stock
 stock underlying restricted stock units will not be issued until the restricted stock units
have vested
 and recipients of restricted stock units generally will have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when
vesting conditions are satisfied.

Deferred
Stock Awards
hypothecated or transferred until issued. Deferred stock will not be issued until the deferred stock award has vested
 and recipients
of deferred stock generally will have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when the vesting conditions are satisfied
and the shares are issued. Deferred stock awards generally will be forfeited
 and the underlying shares of deferred stock will
not be issued
 if the applicable vesting conditions and other restrictions are not met.

Deferred
Stock Units
criteria set by the administrator. The common stock underlying deferred stock units will not be issued until the deferred stock
units have vested
 and recipients of deferred stock units generally will have no voting rights prior to the time when vesting
conditions are satisfied.

Stock
Appreciation Rights (&ldquo;SARS&rdquo;)

 or separately.
SARs granted in connection with stock options or other awards typically will provide for payments to the holder based upon increases
in the price of our Common Stock over a set exercise price. The exercise price of any SAR granted under the 2018 Plan must be
at least 100% of the fair market value of a share of our Common Stock on the date of grant. Except as required by Section 162(m)
of the Code with respect to a SAR intended to qualify as performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m) of the
Code
 there are no restrictions specified in the 2018 Plan on the exercise of SARs or the amount of gain realizable therefrom
although restrictions may be imposed by the administrator in the SAR agreements. SARs under the 2018 Plan will be settled in cash
or shares of common stock
 or in a combination of both
 at the election of the administrator.


    
    


Dividend
Equivalent Awards
 if any
 per share paid by us
 calculated with reference to the number
of shares covered by the award. Dividend equivalents may be settled in cash or shares and at such times as determined by our compensation
committee or board of directors
 as applicable.

Performance
Awards 
 these awards will be based upon specific
performance targets and may be paid in cash or in common stock or in a combination of both. Performance awards may include &ldquo;phantom&rdquo;
stock awards that provide for payments based upon the value of our Common Stock. Performance awards may also include bonuses that
may be granted by the administrator on an individual or group basis and that may be payable in cash or in common stock or in a
combination of both.

Stock
Payment Awards
common stock as part of a deferred compensation or other arrangement in lieu of all or any part of compensation
 including bonuses
that would otherwise be payable in cash to the employee
 consultant or non-employee director.

Change
in Control
consummation of such transaction
 awards issued under the 2018 Plan will be subject to accelerated vesting such that 100% of such
awards will become vested and exercisable or payable
 as applicable. Performance awards will vest in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the applicable award agreement. In the event that
 within the 12 month period immediately following a change
in control
 a participant&rsquo;s services with us are terminated by us other than for cause (as defined in the 2018 Plan) or
by such participant for good reason (as defined in the 2018 Plan)
 then the vesting and
 if applicable
 exercisability of 100%
of the then-unvested shares subject to the outstanding equity awards held by such participant under the 2018 Plan will accelerate
effective as of the date of such termination. The administrator may also make appropriate adjustments to awards under the 2018
Plan and is authorized to provide for the acceleration
 cash-out
 termination
 assumption
 substitution or conversion of such
awards in the event of a change in control or certain other unusual or nonrecurring events or transactions. Under the 2018 Plan
a change in control is generally defined as:

&#9679;
the transfer or exchange in a single transaction or series of related transactions by our stockholders of more than 50% of our
voting stock to a person or group;

&#9679;
a change in the composition of our board of directors over a two-year period such that the members of the board of directors who
were approved by at least two-thirds of the directors who were directors at the beginning of the two-year period or whose election
or nomination was so approved cease to constitute a majority of the board of directors;

&#9679;
a merger
 consolidation
 reorganization or business combination in which we are involved
 directly or indirectly
 other than a
merger
 consolidation
 reorganization or business combination that results in our outstanding voting securities immediately before
the transaction continuing to represent a majority of the voting power of the acquiring company&rsquo;s outstanding voting securities
and after which no person or group beneficially owns 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving entity
immediately after the transaction; or

&#9679;
stockholder approval of our liquidation or dissolution.

Adjustments
of Awards
 stock split
 spin-off
 recapitalization
 distribution of our assets to stockholders
(other than normal cash dividends) or any other corporate event affecting the number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock
or the share price of our Common Stock other than an &ldquo;equity restructuring&rdquo; (as defined below)
 the administrator
may make appropriate
 proportionate adjustments to reflect the event giving rise to the need for such adjustments
 with respect
to:

&#9679;
the aggregate number and type of shares subject to the 2018 Plan;


    
    


&#9679;
the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding awards and terms and conditions of outstanding awards (including
 without
limitation
 any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect to such awards); and

&#9679;
the grant or exercise price per share of any outstanding awards under the 2018 Plan.

In
the event of one of the adjustments described above or other corporate transactions
 in order to prevent dilution or enlargement
of the potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2018 Plan
 the administrator has the discretion to make such
equitable adjustments and may also:

&#9679;
provide for the termination or replacement of an award in exchange for cash or other property;

&#9679;
provide that any outstanding award cannot vest
 be exercised or become payable after such event;

&#9679;
provide that awards may be exercisable
 payable or fully vested as to shares of common stock covered thereby; or

&#9679;
provide that an award under the 2018 Plan cannot vest
 be exercised or become payable after such event.

In
the event of an equity restructuring
 the administrator will make appropriate
 proportionate adjustments to the number and type
of securities subject to each outstanding award and the exercise price or grant price thereof
 if applicable. In addition
 the
administrator will make equitable adjustments
 as the administrator in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect such equity
restructuring
 with respect to the aggregate number and type of shares subject to the 2018 Plan. The adjustments upon an equity
restructuring are nondiscretionary and will be final and binding on the affected holders and the Company.

For
purposes of the 2018 Plan
 &ldquo;equity restructuring&rdquo; means a nonreciprocal transaction between us and our stockholders
such as a stock dividend
 stock split
 spin-off
 rights offering or recapitalization through a large
 nonrecurring cash dividend
that affects the number or kind of shares (or other securities) or the share price of our Common Stock (or other securities) and
causes a change in the per share value of the common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards granted under the 2018 Plan.
In the event of a stock split in connection with an offering
 the administrator will proportionately adjust (i) the number of
shares subject to any outstanding award under the 2018 Plan
 (ii) the exercise or grant price of any such awards
 if applicable
and (iii) the aggregate number of shares subject to the 2018 Plan.

Amendment
and Termination
 amend or modify
the 2018 Plan at any time and from time to time. However
 we must generally obtain stockholder approval:

&#9679;
to increase the number of shares available under the 2018 Plan (other than in connection with certain corporate events
 as described
above);

&#9679;
reduce the price per share of any outstanding option or SAR granted under the 2018 Plan;

&#9679;
cancel any option or SAR in exchange for cash or another award when the option or SAR price per share exceeds the fair market
value of the underlying shares; or

&#9679;
to the extent required by applicable law
 rule or regulation (including any NASDAQ rule).

Termination.

10th anniversary of the effective date of the 2018 Plan
 and no additional annual share increases to the 2018 Plan&rsquo;s aggregate
share limit will occur from and after such anniversary. Any award that is outstanding on the termination date of the 2018 Plan
will remain in force according to the terms of the 2018 Plan and the applicable award agreement.

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

The
following table sets forth information relating to the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock at May 27
 2019
 by:



    
each
    person
 or group of affiliated persons
 known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock;
    

    
    

    
each
    of our directors; 

    
    

    
each
    of our Named Executive Officers; and 

    
    

    
all
    current directors and executive officers as a group. 


The
number of shares beneficially owned by each entity
 person
 director or executive officer is determined in accordance with the
rules of the SEC
 and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such
rules
 beneficial ownership includes any shares over which the individual has sole or shared voting power or investment power
as well as any shares that the individual has the right to acquire within 60 days through the exercise of any stock option
 warrants
or other rights. Except as otherwise indicated
 and subject to applicable community property laws
 the persons named in the table
have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock held by such person.

The
percentage of shares beneficially owned is computed on the basis of 17

Audit
Committee&rsquo;s Pre-Approval Practice

Prior
to our engagement of our independent auditor
 such engagement was approved by our board of directors. The services provided under
this engagement may include audit services
 audit-related services
 tax services and other services. Pre-approval is generally
provided for up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally
subject to a specific budget. Pursuant our requirements
 the independent auditors and management are required to report to our
board of directors at least quarterly regarding the extent of services provided by the independent auditors in accordance with
this pre-approval
 and the fees for the services performed to date. Our board of directors may also pre-approve particular services
on a case-by-case basis. All audit-related fees
 tax fees and other fees incurred by us were approved by our board of directors.


    
    


Pre-Approval
of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services

We
have not yet established an audit committee. Until then
 there are no formal pre-approval policies and procedures. Nonetheless
the auditors engaged for these services are required to provide and uphold estimates for the cost of services to be rendered.
The percentage of hours expended on Brooks and Malone Bailey&rsquo;s respective engagement to audit our financial statements for
the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the principal accountant&rsquo;s full-time
permanent employees was 0%.

 when a reporting entity is&#13;the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (&amp;#8220;VIE&amp;#8221;)
 as defined in ASC 810
 the VIE must&#13;be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner is the primary beneficiary&#13;of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights
 obligations

 2014
 the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. (&amp;#8220;Strike&amp;#8221;)
 a related party entity&#13;which holds the Company&amp;#8217;s inventory on consignment in United Kingdom (see Note 3). The Company evaluated its interest in&#13;Strike and determined that Strike is a VIE due to the Company&amp;#8217;s implicit interest in Strike and the fact that Strike and&#13;the Company were under common control after the transfer of the controlling interest. Moreover
 the Company determined that it&#13;is the primary beneficiary of Strike due to the fact that the Company had both the power to direct the activities that most significantly&#13;impact Strike and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Strike. Therefore

 2014

 Bacolod Blue Star Export Corp. (&amp;#8220;Bacolod&amp;#8221;)
&#13;Bicol Blue Star Export Co. (&amp;#8220;Bicol&amp;#8221;) and John Keeler Real Estate Holding (&amp;#8220;JK Real Estate&amp;#8221;)
 in light of&#13;ASC 810. The Company purchases inventory from Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company&#13;purchased inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate

 Bacolod and Bicol have other customers&#13;besides the Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&amp;#8217;s customer
 they would be able to sustain their operations&#13;from selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company concluded that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&amp;#8217;s and&#13;the Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary

 JK Real Estate&amp;#8217;s&#13;equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance its activities without subordinated financial support.&#13;Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted on behalf of the Company&amp;#8217;s majority stockholder. The&#13;Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate since the Company does not have the power to direct the&#13;activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore


 2018 the Company adopted the&#13;provisions of ASU 2016-18

 the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects&#13;the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition&#13;for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company performs the following five steps:&#13;(1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (3) determine the transaction&#13;price

 the Company utilized its most sale of common stock from November
 2018 to November
&#13;2019 of approximately $1
000

 and it was determined that a step-up analysis was necessary in order to evaluate the fair value of the inventory&#13;at the time of closing. The step up represents the net profit that would be attained when the inventory is sold. The key assumptions&#13;used in this analysis is a gross margin of 11.6% and selling costs of 4.4%
 The analysis resulted in a necessary step up of $105

 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company&#13;purchased inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate

 Bacolod and Bicol have other customers&#13;besides the Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&amp;#8217;s customer
 they would be able to sustain their operations&#13;from selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company concluded that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&amp;#8217;s and&#13;the Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary

 JK Real&#13;Estate&amp;#8217;s equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance its activities without subordinated&#13;financial support. Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted on behalf of the Company&amp;#8217;s majority&#13;stockholder. The Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate since the Company does not have the power&#13;to direct the activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore



 2019&#13;and 2018
 the Company recorded sales return and allowances and refund liability of approximately $59
100 and $159
500
 respectively.&#13;There was no allowance for bad debt recorded during the years ended December 31

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]









and notes have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. Although the company has positive cash flow
from operations for the year ended December 31
 2019

021
703

of $8
952
466 and working capital deficit of $2
786
086

910
136 in subordinated stockholder debt. These circumstances
raise substantial doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company&#8217;s ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon the Company&#8217;s ability to increase revenues
 execute on its business plan to acquire
complimentary companies
 raise capital
 and to continue to sustain adequate working capital to finance its operations. The failure
to achieve the necessary levels of profitability and cash flows would be detrimental to the Company. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.
