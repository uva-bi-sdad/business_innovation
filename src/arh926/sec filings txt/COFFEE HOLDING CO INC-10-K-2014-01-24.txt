&#160;&#160;coffee roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and



Our private label and branded coffee products are sold throughout the United States and Canada to supermarkets
 wholesalers
 and individually owned and multi-unit retail customers.&#160;&#160;Our unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is sold to specialty gourmet roasters.

We conduct our operations in accordance with strict freshness and quality standards.&#160;&#160;All of our private label and branded coffees are produced from high quality coffee beans that are deep roasted for full flavor using a slow roasting process that has been perfected utilizing our more than thirty years of experience in the coffee industry.&#160;&#160;In order to ensure freshness
 our products are delivered to our customers within 72 hours of roasting.&#160;&#160;We believe that our long history has enabled us to develop a loyal customer base.

Our corporate offices are located at 3475 Victory Boulevard
 Staten Island
 New York 10314.&#160;&#160;Our telephone number is (718) 832-0800 and our website address is www.coffeeholding.com.&#160;&#160;The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



To achieve our growth objectives described below
 we intend to leverage the following competitive strengths:


We believe that we are one of the few coffee companies to offer a broad array of branded and private label roasted ground coffees and wholesale green coffee across the spectrum of consumer tastes
 preferences and price points.&#160;&#160;While many of our competitors engage in distinct segments of the coffee business
 we sell products in each of the following areas:









Our branded and private label roasted ground coffees are sold at competitive and value price levels while some of our other branded and specialty coffees are sold predominantly at premium price levels.&#160;&#160;Premium price level coffee is high-quality gourmet coffee
 such as AA Arabica coffee
 which sell at a substantial premium over traditional retail canned coffee
 while competitive and value price level coffee is mainstream or traditional canned coffee.&#160;&#160;Because of this diversification
 we believe that our profitability is not dependent on any one area of the coffee industry and
 therefore
 is less sensitive than our competition to potential coffee commodity price and overall economic volatility.

&#160;&#160;As a large roaster-dealer of green coffee
 we believe that we are favorably positioned to increase our specialty coffee sales.&#160;&#160;Since 1998
 we have increased the number of our wholesale green coffee customers
 including coffee houses
 single store operators
 mall coffee stores and mail order sellers
 by 286% from 150 to 429.&#160;&#160;We are a charter member of the Specialty Coffee Association of America and one of the largest distributors of Swiss Water Processed Decaffeinated Coffees along the East Coast.&#160;&#160;In addition
 although we do not have any formalized
 material agreements or long-term contracts with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (&#8220;GMCR&#8221;)
 we have a 20-year relationship with GMCR
 our largest wholesale green coffee customer.&#160;&#160;Our over 40 years of experience as a roaster and a dealer of green coffee allows us to provide our roasting experience as a value added service to our gourmet roaster customers.&#160;&#160;The assistance we provide to our customers includes training
 coffee blending and market identification.&#160;&#160;We believe that our relationships with wholesale green coffee customers and our focus on selling green coffee as a wholesaler has enabled us to participate in the growth of the specialty coffee market while mitigating the risks associated with the competitive retail specialty coffee environment.
















We have amassed a portfolio of five proprietary name brands sold to supermarkets
 wholesalers and individually owned stores in the United States
 including brands for specialty espresso
 Latin espresso
 Italian espresso
 100% Colombian coffee and blended coffee.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we have entered into a licensing agreement with Del Monte Corporation for the exclusive right to use the S&amp;W and IL CLASSICO trademarks in the United States and other countries approved by Del Monte Corporation in connection with the production
 manufacture and sale of roasted whole bean and ground coffee for distribution to retail customers.&#160;&#160;We plan to broaden our customer base and increase penetration with existing customers by expanding the S&amp;W label from a well-known brand on the West Coast to a well-known brand throughout the United States.&#160;&#160;Our existing portfolio of differentiated brands combined with our management expertise serve as a platform to add additional name brands through acquisition or licensing agreements which target product niches and segments that do not compete with our existing brands.

&#160;&#160;We have been a family-operated business for three generations.&#160;&#160;Throughout this time
 we have remained strong through varying cycles in the coffee industry and the economy.&#160;&#160;Andrew Gordon
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
&#160;and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President &#8211; Operations
 have worked with Coffee Holding for 31 and 33 years
 respectively.&#160;&#160;David Gordon is an original member of the Specialty Coffee Association of America.&#160;&#160;We believe that our employees and management are dedicated to our vision and mission
 which is to produce high quality products
 as well as to provide quality and responsive service to our customers.



We believe that significant growth opportunities exist by selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances
 targeting the rapidly growing Hispanic market in the United States
 increasing penetration with existing customers by adding new products
 and developing our food service business.&#160;&#160;By capitalizing on this strategy
 we hope to continue to grow our business with our commitment to quality and personalized service to our customers.&#160;&#160;We do not intend to compete on price alone nor do we intend to expand sales at the expense of profitability.

&#160;&#160;We have expanded our operations by acquiring coffee companies
 entering into strategic alliances and acquiring or licensing brands
 which complement our business objectives and we intend to continue to seek such opportunities.&#160;&#160;

The Hispanic population in the United States is the fastest growing and now represents the largest minority demographic in the United States.&#160;&#160;We believe there is significant opportunity for our Caf&#233; Caribe and Caf&#233; Supremo brands to gain market share among Hispanic consumers in the United States.&#160;&#160;Caf&#233; Caribe
 which has historically been our leading brand by poundage
 is a specialty espresso coffee that targets espresso coffee drinkers and
 in particular
 Hispanic consumers.&#160;&#160;Caf&#233; Supremo is a specialty espresso coffee which is priced for the more price sensitive Hispanic espresso coffee drinker.

&#160;&#160;We intend to capture additional market share through our existing distribution channels by selectively adding or introducing new brand names and products across multiple price points
 including:





&#160;&#160;We plan to expand further into the food service business by developing new distribution channels for our products.&#160;&#160;Currently
 we have a limited presence in the food service market.&#160;&#160;Food service coffee products tend to have a higher gross profit margin than our traditional supermarket product retail offerings.&#160;&#160;We have expanded our food service offerings to include instant cappuccinos
 tea products and an equipment program for our customers.&#160;&#160;We attend various annual trade shows held by different buying groups
 which provide us a national audience to market our food service products.


&#160;&#160;During 2013
 we (i) introduced our Don Manuel brand for sale in the Shanghai market
 (ii) commenced sales of green coffee into China and (iii) continued to build upon prior sales of our S&amp;W coffee in the Far East.&#160;&#160;We intend to pursue opportunities to increase sales of our green coffee
 private label coffee and branded coffee in the Far East.




















unroasted raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large
 medium and small roasters and coffee shop operators;

coffee roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
&#160;including supermarkets that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and



&#160;&#160;The specialty coffee market represents the fastest growing area of our industry.&#160;&#160;The number of gourmet coffee houses have been increasing in all areas of the United States.&#160;&#160;The growth in specialty coffee sales has created a marketplace for higher quality and differentiated products
 which can be priced at a premium in the marketplace.&#160;&#160;As a large roaster-dealer of green coffee
 we are favorably positioned to increase our specialty coffee sales.&#160;&#160;We sell green coffee beans to small roasters and coffee shop operators located throughout the United States and carry over approximately 90 different varieties.&#160;&#160;Specialty green coffee beans are sold unroasted
 direct from warehouses to small roasters and gourmet coffee shop operators
 which then roast the beans themselves.&#160;&#160;We sell from as little as one bag (132 pounds) to a full truckload (44
000 pounds) of specialty green coffee beans
 depending on the size and need of the customer.&#160;&#160;We believe that we can increase sales of wholesale green coffee without an increase in infrastructure as well as not venturing into the highly competitive retail specialty coffee environment and utilizing our current strategy we can be as profitable or more profitable than our competitors in this segment by selling &#8220;one bag at a time&#8221; rather than &#8220;one cup at a time.&#8221;

&#160;&#160;We roast
 blend
 package and sell coffee under private labels for companies throughout the United States and Canada.&#160;&#160;Our private label coffee is sold in cans
 brick packages and instants in a variety of sizes.&#160;&#160;As of October 31
 2013
We produce private label coffee for customers who desire to sell coffee under their own name but do not want to engage in the manufacturing process.&#160;&#160;Our private label customers seek a quality similar to the national brands at a lower cost
 which represents a better value for the consumer.

&#160;&#160;We roast and blend our branded coffee according to our own recipes and package the coffee at our facilities in La Junta
 Colorado and Brecksville
 Ohio.&#160;&#160;We then sell the packaged coffee under our brand labels to supermarkets
 wholesalers and individually-owned stores throughout the United States.

We hold trademarks for each of our proprietary name brands and have the exclusive right to use the S&amp;W
 IL CLASSICO&#160;brand names&#160;in the United States in connection with the production
 manufacture and sale of roasted whole bean and ground coffee for distribution at the retail level.&#160;&#160;For further information regarding our trademark rights

We also offer several niche products

&#160;Coffee is a commodity traded on the Commodities and Futures Exchange subject to price fluctuations.&#160;&#160;Over the past five years
 the average price per pound of coffee beans ranged from approximately $1.03 to $3.05.&#160;&#160;The price for coffee beans on the commodities market as of October&#160;31
 2013 and 2012 were $1.08 and $1.66 per pound
 respectively.&#160;&#160;Specialty green coffee
 unlike most coffee
 is not tied directly to the commodities cash markets.&#160;&#160;Instead
 it tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium over commodity coffee pricing
 depending on the origin
 supply and demand at the time of purchase.&#160;&#160;We are a licensed Fair Trade dealer for Fair Trade certified coffee.&#160;&#160;Fair Trade certified coffee helps small coffee farmers increase their incomes and improve the prospects of their communities and families by guaranteeing farmers a minimum price of ten cents above the current market price.&#160;&#160;Our Ohio Facility operated by GCC is certified organic by the Organic Crop Improvement Association (OCIA).&#160;&#160;All of our specialty green coffees
 as well as all of the other coffees we import for roasting
 are subject to multiple levels of quality control.

&#160;We purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the United States.&#160;&#160;The dealers supply us with coffee beans from many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
 Brazil and Uganda.&#160;&#160;For the fiscal years ended 2013 and 2012
 approximately 75% and 80% of all of our green coffee purchases were from ten suppliers.&#160;&#160;One of these suppliers
 Rothfos Corporation
 accounted for approximately $31.2 million or 25% in 2013
 and $31.9 million or 19% in 2012
 of our total product purchases.&#160;&#160;An employee of Rothfos Corporation is one of our directors.&#160;&#160;We do not have any formalized
 material agreements or long-term contracts with any of these suppliers.&#160;&#160;Rather
 our purchases are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders.&#160;&#160;We do not believe that the loss of any one supplier
 including Rothfos
 would have a material adverse effect on our operations due to the availability of alternate suppliers.

&#160;The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#160;&#160;Supply and price can be affected by factors such as weather
 politics and economics within the countries that export coffee.&#160;&#160;Increases in the cost of coffee beans can
 to a certain extent
 be passed on to our customers in the form of higher prices for coffee beans and processed coffee.&#160;&#160;Drastic or prolonged increases in coffee prices may also adversely impact our business as it could lead to a decline in overall consumption of coffee.&#160;&#160;Similarly
 rapid decreases in the cost of coffee beans may force us to lower our sale prices before realizing cost reductions in our purchases.

&#160;We subject all of our private unroasted green coffee to both a pre-shipment sample approval and an additional sample approval upon arrival into the United States.&#160;&#160;Once the arrival sample is approved
 we then bring the coffee to one of our facilities to roast and blend according to our own strict specifications.&#160;&#160;During the roasting and blending process
 samples are pulled off the production line and tested on an hourly basis to ensure that each batch roasted is consistent with the others and meets the strict quality standards demanded by our customers and us.



&#160;The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#160;&#160;We have used and continue to use short-term coffee futures and options contracts for the purpose of hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we acquire futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee.&#160;&#160;Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of sales.&#160;&#160;Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase our cost of sales.&#160;&#160;The use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices. However
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts.&#160;&#160;Failure to properly design and implement an effective hedging strategy may materially adversely affect our business and operating results.&#160;&#160;If the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increased losses.&#160;&#160;See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8212;Commodity Price Risks.


















&#160;We hold trademarks
 registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office
 for all seven of our proprietary coffee brands and an exclusive license for S&amp;W
 IL CLASSICO brands for sale in the United States.&#160;&#160;Trademark registrations are subject to periodic renewal and we anticipate maintaining our registrations.&#160;&#160;We believe that our brands are recognizable in the marketplace and that brand recognition is important to the success of our branded coffee business.



We sell wholesale green coffee to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters &#8220;GMCR&#8221;.&#160;&#160;Sales to GMCR accounted for approximately $80.1 million or 60% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 and $108.9 million or 62% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012.

&#160;Although our agreements with wholesale customers generally contain only pricing terms
 our contracts with certain customers also contain minimum and maximum purchase obligations at fixed prices.&#160;&#160;Because our profits on a fixed-price contract could decline if coffee prices increased
 we acquire futures contracts with longer terms (generally three to four months) primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices.&#160;&#160;Although the use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks or increased losses and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contacts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts.&#160;&#160;See &#8220;- Our Use of Derivatives&#8221;



&#160;We market our private label and wholesale coffee through trade shows
 industry publications
 face-to-face contact and through the use of our internal sales force and non-exclusive independent food and beverage sales brokers.&#160;&#160;We also use our web site (www.coffeeholding.com) as a method of marketing our coffee products and ourselves.

&#160;For our private label and branded coffees
 we will
 from time to time
 in conjunction with retailers and with wholesalers
 conduct in-store promotions
 such as product demonstrations
 coupons
 price reductions
 two-for-one sales and new product launches to capture changing consumer taste preferences for upscale canned coffees.

&#160;We evaluate opportunities for growth consistent with our business objectives.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we have established relationships with independent sales brokers to market our products across the United States
 in areas of the country where we have not had a high penetration of sales and Canada.&#160;&#160;We utilize our in-house sales personnel to market our private label brands.&#160;&#160;We intend to capture additional market share in our existing distribution channels by selectively adding or introducing new brand names and products across multiple price points
 including niche specialty blends
 private label &#8220;value&#8221; blends and mini-brick
 filter packages
 and peripheral products.



&#160;We are also a supporter of several coffee-oriented charitable organizations and during fiscal 2013 and 2012
 we donated approximately $47
000 and $48
000
 respectively to charities.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#9679;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For over 18 years
 we have been members of Coffee Kids
 an international non-profit organization that helps to improve the quality of life of children and their families in coffee-growing communities in Mexico
 Guatemala
 Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are members of Grounds for Health
 an organization that educates
 screens
 and arranges treatment for women who have cancer and live in the rural coffee growing communities of Mexico.



&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are the administrative benefactors to a non-profit organization called Cup for Education.&#160;&#160;After discovering the lack of schools
 teachers
 and basic fundamental learning supplies in the poor coffee growing communities of Central and Latin America
 &#8220;Cup&#8221; was established by our employee
 Karen Gordon
 to help build schools
 sponsor teachers
 and purchase basic supplies such as books
 chalk and other necessities for a proper education.





















&#160;&#160;There are many green coffee dealers throughout the United States.&#160;&#160;Many of these dealers have greater financial resources than we do.&#160;&#160;However
 we believe that we have both the knowledge and the capability to assist small specialty gourmet coffee roasters with developing and growing their businesses.&#160;&#160;Our over 40 years of experience as a roaster and a dealer of green coffee allows us to provide our roasting experience as a value added service to our gourmet roaster customers.&#160;&#160;While other coffee merchants may be able to offer lower prices for coffee beans
 we market ourselves as a value-added supplier to small roasters
 with the ability to help them market their specialty coffee products and develop a customer base.&#160;&#160;The assistance we provide our customers includes training
 coffee blending and market identification.&#160;&#160;Because specialty green coffee beans are sold unroasted to small coffee shops and roasters that market their products to local gourmet customers
 we do not believe that our specialty green coffee customers compete with our private label or branded coffee lines of business.&#160;&#160;We believe that the addition of OPTCO as well as our two green coffee salespersons in South Carolina and Oregon allows us to compete more effectively throughout the country.

&#160;&#160;There are several major producers of coffee for private label sales in the United States.&#160;&#160;Many other companies produce coffee for sale on a regional basis.&#160;&#160;Our main competitor is the former retail coffee division of Sara Lee Corporation
 which was purchased by Segafredo Zanetti Group in 2006
 now known as Massimo Zanetti Beverage.&#160;&#160;Massimo Zanetti Beverage is larger and has more financial and other resources than we do and
 therefore
 is able to devote more resources to product development and marketing.&#160;&#160;We believe that we remain competitive by providing a higher level of quality and customer service.&#160;&#160;This service includes ensuring that the coffee produced for each label maintains a consistent taste and is delivered on time and in the proper quantities.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we provide our private label customers with information on the coffee market on a regular basis.

&#160;&#160;Our proprietary brand coffees compete with many other brands that are sold in supermarkets and specialty stores
 primarily in the Northeastern United States.&#160;&#160;The branded coffee market in both the Northeast and elsewhere is dominated by three large companies:&#160;&#160;Kraft General Foods
 Inc. (owner of the Maxwell House brand)
 Smuckers (owner of the Folgers Caf&#233; Bustelo brands) and Massimo Zanetti Beverage which also markets specialty coffee in addition to non-specialty coffee.&#160;&#160;Our large competitors have greater access to capital and a greater ability to conduct marketing and promotions.&#160;&#160;We believe that
 while our competitors&#8217; brands may be more nationally recognizable
 our Caf&#233; Caribe brand is competitive in the fast growing Hispanic demographic and our S&amp;W brand has been a popular and recognizable brand on the West Coast for over 80 years.&#160;&#160;



&#160;Our coffee roasting operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations
 which require us to obtain licenses relating to customs
 health and safety
 building and land use and environmental protection.&#160;&#160;Our roasting facility is subject to state and local air-quality and emissions regulation.&#160;&#160;If we encounter difficulties in obtaining any necessary licenses or if we have difficulty complying with these laws and regulations
 then we could be subject to fines and penalties
 which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.&#160;&#160;In addition
 our product offerings could be limited
 thereby reducing our revenues.





&#160;We have 69 full-time employees.&#160;&#160;None of our employees are represented by unions or collective bargaining agreements.&#160;&#160;Our management believes that we maintain good working relationships with our employees.&#160;&#160;To supplement our internal sales staff
 we sometimes engage independent national and regional sales brokers as independent contractors who work on a commission basis.


















&#160;An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business.&#160;&#160;Before making an investment decision
 you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report.&#160;&#160;In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below
 other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.&#160;&#160;The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks
 and you could lose all of your investment.



&#160;Because our business is highly dependent upon a single commodity
 coffee
 any decrease in demand for coffee could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the roasting
 blending
 packaging and distribution of private label coffee;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the roasting
 blending
 packaging and distribution of proprietary branded coffee; and







&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the type
 number and location of competing products.

&#160;Because we rely on a single commodity
 any decrease in demand for coffee would harm our business more than if we had more diversified product offerings and could materially adversely affect our revenues and operating results.

&#160;If we are unable to geographically expand our branded and private label products

 among other things
 geographic expansion of our branded and private label products as opportunities arise.&#160;&#160;We may not be able to implement successfully this portion of our business strategy.&#160;&#160;Our ability to implement this portion of our business strategy is dependent on our ability to:







&#160;Our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully expand the geographic distribution of our branded and private label products.&#160;&#160;In addition
 our expenses could increase and our profits could decrease as we implement our growth strategy.

&#160;If our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs

 we have acquired and expect to continue to acquire to a lesser extent futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee.&#160;&#160;Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of sales.&#160;&#160;Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase our cost of sales.&#160;&#160;
















&#160;The use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices. However
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts.&#160;&#160;Historically
 we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers
 thereby maintaining our gross profits
 however
 we may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers in the future.&#160;&#160;Failure to properly design and implement an effective hedging strategy may materially adversely affect our business and operating results.&#160;&#160;If the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedging results in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increase losses.&#160;&#160;Although we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred losses on options and futures contracts during some reporting periods.&#160;&#160;In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or increase losses.&#160;&#160;Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease our profitability or increase losses and adversely affect our stock price.

&#160;&#160;In April 2006
 we entered into a joint venture with Caruso&#8217;s Coffee
 Inc. of Brecksville
 Ohio and formed GCC
 which engages in the roasting
 packaging and sale of private label specialty coffee products.&#160;&#160;In addition
 in November 2011
 we invested in Global Mark
 a new venture focusing on supply of instant coffee and related products; this relationship was terminated in December 2012.&#160;&#160;We will continue to seek opportunities for new joint ventures.&#160;&#160;While we believe that our joint ventures will be successful
 losses in our joint ventures
 including our loss in connection with Global Mark
 or any future joint ventures would hurt our profitability. In addition
 we generally will not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding our joint ventures.&#160;&#160;Investments in joint ventures may under certain circumstances
 involve risks not present when a third party is not involved
 including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of the required capital contributions.&#160;&#160;Joint venture partners may have business interests
 strategies or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests
 strategies or goals and may be
 in cases where we have a minority interest
 in a position to take actions contrary to our policies
 strategies or objectives.&#160;&#160;Any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and could prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort exclusively on our business strategies.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party joint venture partners.

&#160;&#160;Any inability to successfully implement our strategy of growth through selective acquisitions
 licensing arrangements and other strategic alliances
 including joint ventures

 the selective acquisition or licensing of additional coffee brands and other strategic alliances
 including joint ventures
 presents risks that could result in increased expenditures and could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability
 including:











such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or other strategic alliances may divert our management&#8217;s attention from our existing operations;



























we may not be able to manage the contingent risks associated with the past operations of
 and other unanticipated problems arising in
 any acquired coffee company; and













we may not be able to control unanticipated costs associated with such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances.




In addition
 any such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances may result in:






&#160;As has been our practice in the past
 we will continuously evaluate any such acquisitions
 licensing opportunities or strategic alliances as they arise.&#160;&#160;However
 we have not reached any new agreements or arrangements with respect to any such acquisition
 licensing opportunity or strategic alliance (other than those described herein) at this time and we may not be able to consummate any acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances on terms favorable to us or at all.&#160;&#160;The failure to consummate any such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances may reduce our growth and expansion.&#160;&#160;In addition
 if these acquisitions
 licensing opportunities or strategic alliances are not successful
 our earnings could be materially adversely affected by increased expenses and decreased revenues.

&#160;&#160;We are dependent upon sales of wholesale green coffee to one customer
 GMCR.&#160;&#160;Sales to GMCR accounted for approximately 60% and 62% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.&#160;&#160;Although no other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our net sales during this period
 other customers may account for more than 10% of our net sales in future periods.&#160;&#160;We generally do not have long-term contracts with these or any of our customers.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty and are free to purchase products from our competitors.&#160;&#160;The loss of
 or reduction in sales to
 customers such as GMCR or any of our other customers to which we sell a significant amount of our products or any material adverse change in the financial condition of such customers would negatively affect our revenues and decrease our earnings.


&#160;If we lose our key personnel
 including Andrew Gordon and David Gordon

 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President &#8211; Operations and Secretary.&#160;&#160;We also depend to a large degree on the expertise of our coffee roasters.&#160;&#160;We do not have employment contracts with our coffee roasters.&#160;&#160;Our ability to source and purchase a sufficient supply of high quality coffee beans and to roast coffee beans consistent with our quality standards could suffer if we lose the services of any of these individuals.&#160;&#160;As a result
 our business and operating results would be adversely affected.&#160;&#160;We may not be successful in obtaining and retaining a replacement for either Andrew Gordon or David Gordon if they elect to stop working for us.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we do not have key-person insurance on the lives of Andrew Gordon or David Gordon.
















From time to time
 we utilize borrowings under our credit facility in connection with operations. Outstanding debt could have important negative consequences to the holders of our securities
 including the following:
















































Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our future operating performance is subject to market conditions and business factors that are beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt
 we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures
 sell assets
 seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt.

Our revolving line of credit contains covenants that place annual restrictions on our operations
 including covenants related to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 minimum deposit restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 distribution restrictions (common stock and preferred stock)
 dividend restrictions and restrictions on intercompany transactions. In addition
 our revolving line of credit requires that we maintain a minimum working capital at all times.&#160;&#160;Although we are currently in compliance with the covenants
 our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by general economic and industry conditions
 as well as market fluctuations in coffee prices and other events beyond our control. We do not know if we will be able to satisfy all such covenants in the future. Our breach of any of the covenants contained in our revolving line of credit could result in a default under such agreement. In the event of a default
 the lender could elect not to make additional loans to us
 could require us to repay some of our outstanding debt prior to maturity
 and/or to declare all amounts borrowed by us
 together with accrued interest
 to be due and payable. In the event that this occurs
 we may be unable to repay all such accelerated indebtedness.&#160;&#160;Any indebtedness that we incur under our revolving line of credit is secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets. If we default under the indebtedness secured by our assets
 those assets would be available to the secured creditors to satisfy our obligations to the secured creditors.


&#160;If our planned increase in marketing expenditures fails to promote and enhance our brands

 which we expect will create and maintain brand loyalty.&#160;&#160;If our brand-building strategy is unsuccessful
 these expenses may never be recovered
 and we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands or protect the value of our brands.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to achieve these goals
 our revenues and ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected.

&#160;Our success in promoting and enhancing our brands will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high quality products and service.&#160;&#160;Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted coffee
 we have no control over our roasted coffee products once they are purchased by our customers.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 wholesale customers may store our coffee for longer periods of time or resell our coffee without our consent
 in each case
 potentially affecting the quality of the coffee prepared from our products.&#160;&#160;Although we believe we are less susceptible to quality control problems than many of our competitors because a majority of our products are sold in cans or brick packs unlike whole bean coffees
 if consumers do not perceive our products and service to be of high quality
 then the value of our brands may be diminished and
 consequently
 our operating results and ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected.

















&#160;Our roasting methods are not proprietary
 so competitors may be able to duplicate them
 which could harm our competitive position.&#160;&#160;If our competitive position is weakened

 therefore
 essential to our brands of coffee.&#160;&#160;Because we do not hold any patents for our roasting methods
 it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known.&#160;&#160;If our competitors copy our roasting methods
 the value of our coffee brands may be diminished
 and we may lose customers to our competitors.&#160;&#160;In addition
 competitors may be able to develop roasting methods that are more advanced than our roasting methods
 which may also harm our competitive position.

&#160;The success of our brand also depends in part on our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trademarks
 copyrights
 service marks
 trade secrets and similar rights to protect our intellectual property. The success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand in both domestic and international markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate
 or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property
 the value of our brand may be harmed
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may become engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property
 which could result in substantial costs to us as well as diversion of management attention.

&#160;Since we rely heavily on common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis
 any disruption in their services or increase in shipping costs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers
 which could result in reduced revenues
 increased operating expenses

 contract disputes and other factors.&#160;&#160;If we experience an interruption in these services
 we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner
 which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship with our customers.&#160;&#160;In addition
 a delay in shipping could require us to contract with alternative
 and possibly more expensive
 common carriers and could cause orders to be cancelled or receipt of goods to be refused.&#160;&#160;Any significant increase in shipping costs could lower our profit margins or force us to raise prices
 which could cause our revenue and profits to suffer.

&#160;If there was a significant interruption in the operation of our Colorado facility
 we may not have the capacity to service all of our customers and we may not be able to service our customers in a timely manner

 natural disaster
 power loss
 telecommunications failure or similar events. In addition
 growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the capacity of our systems and lead to degradations in performance or systems failure. Although we continually review and consider upgrades to our order fulfillment infrastructure and provide for system redundancies to limit the likelihood of systems overload or failure
 substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure that causes interruptions for a number of days could adversely affect our business. Additionally
 if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our order fulfillment infrastructure
 our ability to grow may be constrained.&#160;&#160;As a result
 our revenues and earnings could be materially adversely affected.

&#160;Prolonged negative economic conditions could adversely affect us
 our customers and suppliers

 difficulties in the financial services sector
 diminished liquidity and availability of credit
 concerns regarding inflation
 increases in the costs of commodities
 continuing high unemployment rates
 reduced consumer spending and consumer confidence and continuing economic uncertainties.&#160;&#160;If the United States economy were to deteriorate significantly
 our business could be negatively impacted.

Our business strategy contemplates potential future access to financing to fund the expansion of our business.&#160;Recent events in the financial markets have had an adverse impact on the credit markets and equity securities
 including our common stock
 have exhibited a high degree of volatility.&#160;Although we intend to seek opportunities to obtain additional capital
 we may not be able to do so.&#160;Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon the prevailing capital market conditions
 as well as our business performance.&#160;&#160;If additional financing is raised by the issuance of common stock you may suffer additional dilution and if additional financing is raised through debt financing
 it may involve significant restrictive covenants which could affect our ability to operate our business. The inability to obtain sufficient capital to fund the expansion of our business could have a material adverse effect on us.


If we fail to continue to develop and maintain our brand

 we may never recover the expenses incurred in connection with these efforts and we may be unable to increase our future revenue or implement our business strategy.&#160;&#160;Our success in promoting and enhancing our brand will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high-quality products and customer service.&#160; Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted coffee
 we have no control over our coffee products once purchased by customers.&#160; Accordingly
 customers may prepare coffee from our brands inconsistent with our standards
 store our coffee for long periods of time or resell our coffee without our consent
 which in each case
 potentially affects the quality of the coffee prepared from our products.&#160; If customers do not perceive our products and service to be of high-quality
 then the value of our brand may be diminished and
 consequently
 our ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected.



















&#160;&#160;Green coffee is our largest single cost of sales.&#160;&#160;Coffee is a traded commodity and
 in general
 its price can fluctuate depending on:


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;economic and political conditions affecting coffee-producing countries
 including acts of terrorism in such countries;



&#160;If the cost of wholesale green coffee increases due to any of these factors
 our margins could decrease and our profitability could suffer accordingly.&#160;&#160;It is expected that coffee prices will remain volatile in the coming years.&#160;&#160;Although we have historically attempted to raise the selling prices of our products in response to increases in the price of wholesale green coffee
 when wholesale green coffee prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels
 we are not always able to pass the price increases through to our customers on a timely basis
 if at all
 which adversely affects our operating margins and cash flow.&#160;&#160;We may not be able to recover any future increases in the cost of wholesale green coffee.&#160;&#160;Even if we are able to recover future increases
 our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation of price increases.

Disruptions in the supply of green coffee could result in a deterioration of our relationship with our customers

 pest damage
 economic conditions
 acts of terrorism
 as well as efforts by coffee growers to expand or form cartels or associations.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the political situation in many of the Arabica coffee growing regions
 including Africa
 Indonesia
 and Central and South America
 can be unstable
 and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions. If Arabica coffee beans from a region become unavailable or prohibitively expensive
 we could be forced to discontinue particular coffee types and blends or substitute coffee beans from other regions in our blends. Frequent substitutions and changes in our coffee product lines could lead to cost increases
 customer alienation and fluctuations in our gross margins.

&#160;Some of the Arabica coffee beans of the quality we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets.&#160;&#160;Rather
 we purchase the high-end Arabica coffee beans that we use on a negotiated basis.&#160;&#160;We depend on our relationships with coffee brokers
 exporters and growers for the supply of our primary raw material
 high quality Arabica coffee beans.&#160;&#160;If any of our relationships with coffee brokers
 exporters or growers deteriorate
 we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high quality coffee beans at prices acceptable to us or at all.&#160;&#160;In such case
 we may not be able to fulfill the demand of our existing customers
 supply new retail stores or expand other channels of distribution.&#160;&#160;A raw material shortage could result in a deterioration of our relationship with our customers
 decreased revenues or could impair our ability to expand our business.

&#160;The coffee industry is highly competitive and if we cannot compete successfully

 as well as quality
 reputation and viability for wholesale and brand loyalty for retail.&#160;&#160;To the extent that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key competitive factor
 our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected.&#160;&#160;Our private label and branded coffee products compete with other manufacturers of private label coffee and branded coffees.&#160;&#160;These competitors
 such as Kraft General Foods
 Inc. (owner of the Maxwell House brand)
 Smuckers (owner of the Folgers Caf&#233; Bustelo brands) and&#160;Massimo Zanetti Beverage have much greater financial
 marketing
 distribution
 management and other resources than we do for marketing
 promotions and geographic and market expansion.&#160;&#160;In addition
 there are a growing number of specialty coffee companies who provide specialty green coffee and roasted coffee for retail sale.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and new competitors
 we may lose our customers or experience reduced sales and profitability.

Besides coffee
 we face exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations

 we are exposed to cost fluctuation in other commodities
 including
 in particular
 steel
 natural gas and gasoline.&#160; In addition
 an increase in the cost of fuel could indirectly lead to higher electricity costs
 transportation costs and other commodity costs. Much like coffee costs
 the costs of these commodities depend on various factors beyond our control
 including economic and political conditions
 foreign currency fluctuations
 and global weather patterns. To the extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers through price increases
 our margins and profitability will decrease.


Coffee contains caffeine and other active compounds
 the health effects of some of which are not fully understood.&#160; A number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate
 nausea and vomiting
 restlessness and anxiety
 depression
 headaches
 tremors
 sleeplessness and other adverse health effects.&#160; An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in coffee could significantly reduce the demand for coffee
 which could harm our business and reduce our sales and profits. In addition
 we could become subject to litigation relating to the existence of such compounds in our coffee; litigation that could be costly and could divert management attention.




















Our operating results may fluctuate significantly

 many of which are outside of our control.&#160;&#160;These fluctuations could be caused by a number of factors including:




































































&#160;As a result of the foregoing
 period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and those comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 our operating results in future quarters may be below market expectations.&#160;&#160;In this event
 the price of our common stock may decline.

Members of the Gordon family
 including Andrew Gordon
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
&#160;Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
&#160;and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President and Secretary
 own
 in the aggregate
 approximately 11.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result
 the Gordon family is able to influence the actions that require stockholder approval
 including:

































the approval of mergers
 sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval.




As a result
 our other stockholders may have reduced influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval.

Repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our&#160;share price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our stock prices to be higher than it would be in the absense of such a program and could potentially reduce that market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value
 short-term price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness.


&#160;&#160;The market price and trading volume of our common stock has been volatile during our past history and it may continue to be volatile. From May 1
 2011 through January 23
 2014
 our common stock has traded as low as $4.51 and as high as $30.98.&#160;&#160;We cannot predict the price at which our common stock will trade in the future and it may decline. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly and may be influenced by many factors
 including our financial results
 developments generally affecting the coffee industry
 general economic
 industry and market conditions
 the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock
 fluctuations in coffee prices
 investor perceptions of our business
 reports by industry analysts
 negative announcements by our customers
 competitors or suppliers regarding their own performances.

















&#160;Provisions in our articles of incorporation
 bylaws and of Nevada law have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control that could be beneficial to our stockholders

 bylaws and Nevada corporate law contain provisions that could delay
 defer or prevent a change in control of us or our management that could be beneficial to our stockholders.&#160;&#160;These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.&#160;&#160;These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer
 even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a price above the then current market price for shares of our common stock.&#160;&#160;These provisions:












































authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares
 which would be senior to our common stock
 without prior stockholder approval; 























a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms
 which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; and











provide a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent
 thereby only permitting stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders.




&#160;We are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Nevada law.&#160;&#160;Under Nevada law
 a corporation may not
 in general
 engage in a business combination with any &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; which includes
 among other things
 a holder of 10% or more of its common stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or
 among other things
 the board of directors has approved the transaction.










&#160;We are headquartered at 3475 Victory Boulevard
 Staten Island
 New York
 where we lease office and warehouse space.&#160;&#160;We pay annual rent of $117
007 under the terms of the lease
 which expires on October 31
 2023.

&#160;We lease a 50
000 square foot facility located at 27700 Frontage Road in La Junta
 Colorado from the City of La Junta.&#160;&#160;We pay annual rent of $100
093 under the terms of the lease
 which expires in January 2024.


&#160;&#160;We lease office space in Vancouver
 Washington.&#160;&#160;We pay annual rent of $35
438 under the terms of a lease
 which expires in May 2015.

&#160;We also use a variety of independent
 bonded commercial warehouses to store our green coffee beans.&#160;&#160;Our management believes that our facilities are adequate for our current operations and for our contemplated operations in the foreseeable future.


















&#160;We are not a party to
 and none of our property is the subject of
 any pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation that is incidental to our business.&#160;&#160;To our knowledge
 no governmental authority is contemplating initiating any such proceedings.




























MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY 



&#160;Our common stock trades on Nasdaq under the symbol &#8220;JVA.&#8221;&#160;&#160;On June 25
 2010
 our Board of Directors approved a regular dividend program of $0.03 per share to shareholders (each
 a &#8220;Quarterly Dividend&#8221;) and paid a Quarterly Dividend through December 28
 2012.&#160;&#160;On June 13
 2013
 the Company announced that the dividend program had been terminated.


&#160;As of January 23
 2014
 we had 335 holders of record.

&#160;We did not repurchase any of our common stock during the quarter ended October 31
 2013.

 no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we undertake no responsibility to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances
 that occur after the date of this annual report.





















&#160;We are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the United States and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes
 preferences and price points.&#160;&#160;As a result
 we believe that we are well-positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles of the coffee market and economic conditions.

&#160;Our net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.&#160;&#160;For this reason
 we have made
 and will continue to evaluate
 strategic decisions to invest in measures that are expected to increase net sales.&#160;&#160;These transactions include our acquisitions of Premier Roasters
 LLC
 including equipment and a roasting facility in La Junta
 Colorado
 a West Coast Brand Manager to market our S&amp;W brand and to increase sales of S&amp;W coffee to new customers
 our joint venture with Caruso&#8217;s Coffee
 Inc. of Brecksville
 Ohio the transaction with Organic Products and the addition of three sales persons from the Caf&#233; Bustelo division of Folgers to assist with the expansion of our Caf&#233; Caribe and Supremo brands.&#160;&#160;We believe these efforts will allow us to expand or business.

&#160;Our net sales are affected by the price of green coffee.&#160;&#160;We purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the United States.&#160;&#160;The dealers supply us with coffee beans from many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
 Brazil and Uganda.&#160;&#160;The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#160;&#160;For example
 in Brazil
 which produces approximately 40% of the world&#8217;s green coffee
 the coffee crops are historically susceptible to frost in June and July and drought in September
 October and November.&#160;&#160;However
 because we purchase coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one country&#8217;s coffee for another in our products
 price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations
 liquidity and capital resources.&#160;&#160;Historically
 because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers
 increased prices of green coffee generally result in increased net sales.

We have used
 and continue to use
 short-term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our cost of sales.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we acquire futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices.&#160;&#160;Although the use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we would remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts.&#160;&#160;If the hedges that we enter into do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increase of our losses.&#160;&#160;See &#8220;Item 1 &#8211; Business - Our Use of Derivatives.&#8221;&#160;&#160;




&#160;The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.&#160;&#160;Estimates are used for
 but not limited to
 the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventories
 assets held for sale
 income taxes and loss contingencies.&#160;&#160;Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.&#160;&#160;Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
















&#160;We believe the following critical accounting policies
 among others
 may be impacted significantly by judgment
 assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements:


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We recognize revenue in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance.&#160;&#160;Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers which is upon the shippers taking possession of the goods because i) title passes in accordance with the terms of the purchase orders and with our agreements with our customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered by the customers&#8217; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is determinable and v) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.&#160;&#160;Thus
 revenue is recognized at the point of shipment.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers&#8217; inability to make required payments.&#160;&#160;If there is deterioration of our customers&#8217; credit worthiness and/or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used
 additional allowances may be required.&#160;&#160;For example
 every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible
 would decrease our operating income by approximately $124
000 for the year ended October 31
 2013.&#160;&#160;The reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated discount that customers will take upon payment.&#160;&#160;The reserve for other allowances represents the estimated amount of returns
 slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by us from our customers.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inventories are stated at lower of cost (determined on a first-in
 first-out basis) or market.&#160;&#160;Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions
 inventories are subject to be written-down to market value.&#160;&#160;If our assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
 additional write-downs of inventories may be required.&#160;&#160;Each additional one percent of potential inventory writedown would have decreased operating income by approximately $94
000 for the year ended October 31
 2013.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In accordance with ASC 740 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;)
 management routinely evaluates the likelihood of the realization of its income tax benefits and the recognition of its deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for any valuation allowance
 management will assess whether it is more likely than not that some portion
 or all
 of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. Ultimately
 the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or tax credits and tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In performing its analyses
 management considers both positive and negative evidence including historical financial performance
 previous earnings patterns
 future earnings forecasts
 tax planning strategies
 economic and business trends and the potential realization of net operating loss carry-forwards within a reasonable timeframe. To this end
 management considered (i) that the Company had taxable income from 2011 through 2012 of approximately $6
700
000 million and anticipates generating a sufficient level of future profits in order to realize the benefits of its deferred tax asset; (ii) tax planning strategies; and (iii) the adequacy of future income to realize the benefits of its remaining recorded deferred tax assets. The Company believes that the continued growth of its business will produce positive operating results.&#160;&#160;Furthermore
 the Company will be filing for a net operating loss carryback
 which will immediately utilize approximately $2
500
000 of its net operating losses
 which will have the effect of realizing approximately $866
000 (through its anticipated income tax refund) of its deferred tax assets.&#160;&#160;As of and for the year ended October 31
 2013
 management has not established any valuation allowance.

A liability for &#8220;unrecognized tax benefits&#8221; is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in the Company&#8217;s tax filings that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. As of October 31
 2013 and October 31
 2012
 no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The guidance also discusses the classification of related interest and penalties on income taxes. The Company&#8217;s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. No interest or penalties were recorded during the years ended October 31
 2013 and October 31
 2012.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our goodwill consists of the cost in excess of the fair market value of the acquired net assets of OPTCO
 which has been integrated into a structure that does not provide the basis for separate reporting units. Consequently
 we are a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. We also have intangible assets consisting of our customer list and relationships and trademarks acquired from OPTCO. At October 31
 2013 our balance sheet reflected goodwill and intangible assets as set forth below:

 2013




Customer list and relationships

Goodwill and the trademarks which are deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill impairment tests require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Upon completion of such review
 if impairment is found to have occurred
 a corresponding charge will be recorded. The value assigned to the customer list and relationships is being amortized over a twenty year period.

Because the Company is a single reporting unit
 the closing NASDAQ Capital Market price of our common stock as of the acquisition date was used as a basis to measure the fair value of goodwill.&#160;&#160;Goodwill and the intangible assets will be tested annually at the end of each fiscal year to determine whether they have been impaired. Upon completion of each annual review
 there can be no assurance that a material charge will not be recorded. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment or decline in value may have occurred.


















Year Ended October 31
 2013 (Fiscal Year 2013) Compared to the Year Ended October 31
 2012 (Fiscal Year 2012)

&#160;&#160;We had a net loss of $1
480
235
 or $0.23 per share basic and diluted
 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 compared to a net income of $2
485
677
 or $0.39 per share basic and $0.37 diluted for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012. The decrease in net income reflects the increased realized loss and decreased unrealized gains on hedging activities during the fiscal year.

&#160;&#160;Net sales totaled $133
980
759 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013
 a decrease of $39
675
456
 or 22.8%
 from $173
656
215 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;The decrease in net sales reflects an approximate 60% lower commodity price during the fiscal year which resulted in a decrease in the price per pound of coffee sold by us.

&#160;&#160;Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 was $128
011
678
 or 95.5% of net sales
 as compared to $161
649
282
 or 93.1%
 of net sales for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity.&#160;&#160;The increase in cost of sales primarily reflects our lower green coffee prices offset by increased realized losses and decreased unrealized gains on hedging activities.&#160;&#160;Cost of sales includes purchases of approximately $31.2 million and $31.9 million in fiscal years 2013 and 2012
 respectively
 from a related party.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;Gross profit for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 was $5
969
081
 a decrease of $6
037
852 from $12
006
933 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 4.5% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 from 6.9% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012 due to net realized hedging losses and unrealized hedging gains of $6
208
648 and $383
349
 respectively
 during fiscal 2013 as compared to net realized and unrealized hedging losses and gains of $667
302 and $500
169
 respectively
 during fiscal 2012.

&#160;&#160;Total operating expenses decreased $85
359
 or 1.1%
 to $7
521
910 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 from $7
607
269 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Selling and administrative expenses increased $39
620
 or 0.6%
 to $6
939
819 for the year ended October 31
 2013 from $6
900
199 for&#160; the year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Officers&#8217; salary decreased $124
979 or 17.7% to $582
091 for the year ended October 31
 2013 from $707
070 for the year ended October 31
&#160;2012.

&#160;&#160;Other expense for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 was $168
821
 a decrease of $176
064 from $344
885 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;The decrease in other expense was attributable to an increase in interest and other income of $10
177 and a decrease in our loss from our equity investments of $62
288
 and a decrease in our loss from MF Global of $14
690
 and a decrease in interest expense of $88
909.

&#160;&#160;We had a loss of $1
721
650 before income taxes and non-controlling interest in subsidiary for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 compared to income of $4
054
779 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012 resulting in a decrease of $5
776
429 for the year ended October 31
 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to our decreased realized trading gains.


&#160;&#160;Our (benefit) provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 totaled $(393
767) compared to a provision of $1
470
381 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;The change was attributable to a lower total income.



&#160;As of October 31
 2013
 we had working capital of $19
420
202
 which represented a $15
597 increase from our working capital of $19
404
605 as of October 31
 2012
 and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $21
750
065 which decreased by $1
867
614 from our total stockholders&#8217; equity of $23
617
679 as of October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Our working capital increased primarily due to an increase of $289
290 in prepaid green coffee
 $937
554 in prepaid and refundable income taxes
 $628
011 in deferred income tax asset and a decrease in account payable and accrued expenses of $4
524
285
 and a decrease in due to broker of $383
349
 a decrease in income taxes payable of $21
122
 partially offset by a decrease of $3
532
914 in cash
 $270
336 in accounts receivable
 $1
930
563 in inventory
 $367
519 in prepaid expenses and other current assets
 and an increase of $666
682 in our line of credit.&#160;&#160;As of October 31
 2013
 the outstanding balance on our line of credit was $1
229
182 compared to $562
500 as of October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Total stockholders&#8217; equity decreased primarily due to our net loss and our dividends paid for fiscal year ended October 31
 2013.

On February 17
 2009
 we entered into a financing agreement with Sterling National Bank (&#8220;Sterling&#8221;) for a $5
000
000 credit facility.&#160;&#160;The credit facility is a revolving $5
000
000 line of credit and we can draw on the line at an amount up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible inventory consisting of green coffee beans and finished coffee not to exceed $1
000
000.&#160;&#160;Sterling shall have the right from time to time to adjust the foregoing percentages based upon
 among other things
 dilution
 its sole determination of the value or likelihood of collection of eligible accounts receivables owed to us and considerations regarding inventory.&#160;&#160;The credit facility is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate of&#160;4.25% at October 31
 2013 and 2012.
















On July 22
 2010
 we had the credit facility increased to $7
000
000.&#160;&#160;In addition
 OPTCO was added as a co-borrower and the inventory sublimit was raised from $1
000
000 to $2
000
000.&#160;&#160;Subsequent to July 31
 2010
 $1
800
000 of the credit facility was allocated to OPTCO.


The initial term of the credit facility was for three years and expired on February 17
 2012.&#160;&#160;The initial terms of the credit facility provided that the credit facility may be automatically extended for successive periods of one year each unless one party shall have provided the other party with a written notice of termination at least ninety days prior to the expiration of the then current term.&#160;&#160;Prior to the expiration of the initial term
 and effective as of February 12
 2012
 the term was extended until February 17
 2014 and the interest rate was reduced to the Wall Street Journal Prime rate (which is currently 3.25%) plus one percent (1%).&#160;On May 10
 2013
 the Credit Facility was extended until February 17
 2015.&#160;The credit facility is secured by all our tangible and intangible assets.


The credit facility contains covenants that place annual restrictions on our operations
 including covenants relating to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 minimum deposit restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 distribution restrictions (common stock and preferred stock)
 dividend restrictions
 and restrictions on intercompany transactions.&#160;&#160;The credit facility also requires that we maintain a minimum working capital at all times.&#160;&#160;We were in compliance with all required financial covenants at October 31
 2013 and 2012.

On February 3
 2011
 we amended the credit facility regarding the creation of a sublimit within the revolving line of credit in the form of a $300
000 term loan for the benefit of GCC.&#160;&#160;We provided a corporate guarantee to Sterling in connection with the amendment.

&#160;For the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013
 our operating activities used net cash of $3
276
259 as compared to the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012 when operating activities provided net cash of $8
026
512.&#160;&#160;The decreased cash flow from operations for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 was primarily due to decreases in net income of $3
912
281
 decreases in accounts receivable of $3
118
117
 prepaid green coffee of $528
044
 prepaid and refundable income taxes of $1
257
763
 deferred income taxes of $705
500 and increases in account payable of $2
921
578
 partially offset by increases in inventory of $261
789
 prepaid expenses and other current assets of $795
853.

&#160;&#160;&#160;For the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013
 our investing activities used net cash of $535
960 as compared to the fiscal year October 31
 2012 when net cash used by investing activities was $2
669
899.&#160;&#160;The decrease in our uses of cash in investing activities was primarily due to our equity method investments of $2
100
000.

&#160;For the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013
 our financing activities provided net cash of $279
305 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2
032
365 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;The change in cash flow from financing activities for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2013 was primarily due to our reduced borrowing and dividend payments.

&#160;We expect to fund our operations
 including paying our liabilities
 funding capital expenditures and making required payments on our debts
 through October 31
 2014 with cash provided by operating activities and the use of our credit facility.&#160;&#160;In addition
 an increase in eligible accounts receivable and inventory would permit us to make additional borrowings under our line of credit.



&#160;We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.




















We are subject to market risk from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.&#160;&#160;As of October 31
 2013
 our debt consisted of $1
229
182 of variable rate debt under our revolving line of credit.&#160;&#160;Our line of credit provides for a maximum of $7
000
000 and is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate (currently 3.25%) plus 1%.&#160;&#160;This loan is secured by all&#160;tangible and intangible assets of the Company.


&#160;The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#160;&#160;We have used
 and continue to use
 short-term coffee futures and options contracts for the purpose of hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices as further explained in Note 2 of the notes to financial statements in this report.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we acquire futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee.&#160;&#160;Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of sales.&#160;&#160;Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase our cost of sales.&#160;&#160;The use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices.&#160;&#160;We believe that
 in normal economic times
 our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales
 but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while trying to minimize margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices.&#160;&#160;However
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to increases in losses on our futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts.&#160;&#160;Although we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred losses on options and futures contracts during some reporting periods.&#160;&#160;In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or increase losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease our profitability or increase losses and adversely affect our stock price.&#160;&#160;See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; If our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we may be forced to pay greater than market value for green coffee and our profitability may be reduced.&#8221;

&#160;As of October 31
 2013
 we held 149 future contracts for the purchase of 5
587
500 pounds of coffee at a weighted average price of $1.19 per pound compared to 319 future contracts for the purchase of 11
962
500 pounds of coffee at a weighted average price of $1.66 per pound for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;The fair market value of coffee applicable to such contracts was $1.08 and $1.55 per pound
 respectively.&#160;&#160;We also held 120 options covering an aggregate of 4
500
000 pounds of green coffee beans at $1.10 per pound.&#160;&#160;The fair market value of these options was $244
800 at October 31
 2013.&#160;&#160;We did not hold any options at October 31
 2012.

























On April 12
 2013
 Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. (&#8220;Coffee Holding&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) engaged Marcum LLP (&#8220;Marcum&#8221;) as the Company&#8217;s new independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31
 2013. The engagement of Marcum by the Company was approved by the Audit Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors.


On April 12
 2013
 following Coffee Holding&#8217;s engagement of Marcum
 the Company dismissed its former accounting firm ParenteBeard LLC (&#8220;ParenteBeard&#8221;).&#160;&#160;The reports of ParenteBeard on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended October 31
 2011 and October 31
 2012 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty
 audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended October 31
 2011 and October 31
 2012 and periods subsequent through dismissal
 there were no disagreements with ParenteBeard on any matter of accounting principles or practices
 financial statement disclosure
 or auditing scope or procedure
 which disagreements
 if not resolved to ParenteBeard&#8217;s satisfaction
 would have caused ParenteBeard to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report. During the fiscal years ended October 31
 2011 and October 31
 2012 and periods subsequent through dismissal
 there were no &#8220;reportable events&#8221; as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.






During the fiscal years ended October 31
 2012 and 2011 and through the date of the Audit Committee's decision
 the Company nor anyone on its behalf
 consulted Marcum regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction
 either completed or proposed
 or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of the Company
 in any case where a written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by Marcum that Marcum concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting
 auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a &#8220;disagreement&#8221; (as that term is used in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a &#8220;reportable event&#8221; (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).





Management
 which includes our President
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.&#160;&#160;Based upon that evaluation
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file and submit under the Exchange Act is (i)&#160;recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported as and when required and (ii)&#160;accumulated and communicated
 as is appropriate
 to our management
 including its principal executive officer and financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.



&#160;Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets
 provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and the directors
 and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
















&#160;&#160;Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160;&#160;Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

&#160;Our management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 31
 2013.&#160;&#160;In making this assessment
 management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.&#160;&#160;Based on our assessment management believes that
 as of October 31
 2013
 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.


&#160;&#160;&#160;There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected
 or that is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

of Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of October 31
 2013
 and the related consolidated statements of operation
 stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the consolidated financial position of Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. and Subsidiaries as of October 31
 2013
 and the consolidated results of its operation and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 Inc. (the &amp;#147;Company&amp;#148;) conducts&#13;wholesale coffee operations
 including manufacturing
 roasting
 packaging
 marketing and distributing roasted and blended coffees&#13;for private labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green coffee.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company&amp;#146;s core product
 coffee

 blended
&#13;packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others

 wholesalers
 and individually-owned and multi-unit retailers.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company&amp;#146;s unprocessed&#13;green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is sold primarily to specialty gourmet roasters and to coffee&#13;shop operators in the United States with limited sales in Australia
 Canada

 private label
 and branded&#13;coffee product categories generate revenues and cost of sales individually but incur selling
 general and administrative expenses&#13;in the aggregate. There are no individual product managers and discrete financial information is not available for any of the product&#13;lines. The Company&amp;#146;s product portfolio is used in one business and it operates and competes in one business activity and&#13;economic environment. In addition
 the three product lines share customers
 manufacturing resources
 sales channels
 and marketing&#13;support. Thus

 2012
 the Company entered into a stock purchase&#13;agreement with Healthwise Gourmet Coffees
 LLC (&amp;#147;HGC&amp;#148;) to purchase an additional 10% interest in HGC.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;HGC&#13;is a coffee distributor specializing in a TechnoRoasting process that results in a coffee with lower acidity levels.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;Company invested $100
000 for the additional 10% interest.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Previously

 2011
 the Company entered into a stock purchase&#13;agreement with Global Mark LLC
 Peter Schmalfeld and Lawrence Elsie to purchase a 40% interest in Global Mark LLC (&amp;#147;GM&amp;#148;).&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;terms of the agreement provided for the Company to pay up to an aggregate of $2
000
000 in cash to fund operations and for GM to&#13;provide to the Company a preferred pricing arrangement for the supply of instant coffee.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;On December 10
 2012
 the Company&#13;entered into an agreement with GM and other members of GM
 whereby the Company withdrew as a member of GM.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;As a result&#13;of GM&amp;#146;s inability to successfully develop a significant customer base (other than the Company) and the Company&amp;#146;s evaluation&#13;of the long term prospects of the GM relationship
 the Company determined that it was in the best interests of the parties to terminate&#13;the relationship.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;In connection with withdrawing from GM
 the Company received assets comprised of cash
 receivables&#13;and inventory equal to approximately $1.8 million
 resulting in a write down of approximately $130
000
 which was recognized as&#13;of October 31
 2012.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2013
 the Company received the final accounting of&#13;the GM business.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The amount of cash received was approximately $104
000 less than originally expected
 resulting in&#13;the final write down that was recognized as of January 31

 2010
 the Company entered into an asset purchase&#13;agreement with Organic Products Trading Company
 Inc. to purchase certain assets.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company formed a wholly-owned&#13;subsidiary Coffee Holding&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Acquisition Company
 LLC to purchase the assets. Subsequent to the closing
 the&#13;Company changed the name of the subsidiary to Organic Products Trading Company

 2006
 the Company entered into a joint venture&#13;with Caruso&amp;#146;s Coffee
 Inc. and formed Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&amp;#147;GCC&amp;#148;).&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company now owns&#13;a 60% equity interest in GCC.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;GCC operates the facility located in Brecksville
 Ohio and is in the same general business&#13;as the Company.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company also exercises control of GCC.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;As a result of its 60% equity interest and control&#13;of GCC

&#13;accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at which&#13;the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Fair value estimates are made at a specific point&#13;in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;These estimates are subjective&#13;in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore

 the Company
 acting as an agent on behalf of the customer
 may file a claim&#13;for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an agent on behalf of its customers
 but&#13;may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper keeps the damaged product.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;Company will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the Company receives reimbursement&#13;or credit from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an accrual for returns for&#13;damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company estimates that
 based on historical&#13;trends

 the Company will accept those two types of items back as returns. The amount for these two&#13;types of returns are estimated

 the Financial Accounting Standards&#13;Board has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-11
 &lt;i&gt;Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets&#13;and Liabilities&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;#160; Upon adoption an entity is required to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements&#13;to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;amendments in this guidance are effective for the Company for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after January 1
&#13;2013

 &lt;i&gt;Intangibles--Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.&lt;/i&gt; This ASU&#13;states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances&#13;indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If
 after assessing the totality&#13;of events and circumstances
 an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset&#13;is impaired
 then the entity is not required to take further action. However
 if an entity concludes otherwise
 then it is required&#13;to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing&#13;the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with Codification Subtopic 350-30
 &lt;i&gt;Intangibles--Goodwill and Other

 an entity also has the&#13;option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to&#13;performing the quantitative impairment test. An entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any&#13;subsequent period.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for&#13;fiscal years beginning after September 15
 2012. Early adoption is permitted
 including for annual and interim impairment&#13;tests performed as of a date before July 27
 2012
 if a public entity&amp;#146;s financial statements for the most recent annual&#13;or interim period have not yet been issued or
 for nonpublic entities

&lt;/b&gt; Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope&#13;of Disclosure about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. The ASU clarifies disclosures required for derivatives accounted for in&#13;accordance with Topic 815
 Derivatives and Hedging
 including bifurcated embedded derivatives
 repurchase agreements
 and securities&#13;borrowing and lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with Section 310-20-45 or Section 815-10-46 or subject&#13;to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning&#13;after January 1
 2013. The Company adopted this guidance in 2013 without material impact on its financial position

&#13;accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at which&#13;the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Fair value estimates are made at a specific point&#13;in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;These estimates are subjective&#13;in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore


 ii) any risk of loss is covered by the Company&amp;#146;s customers&amp;#146;&#13;insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is determinable and v) collection of the&#13;resulting receivable is reasonably assured.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Thus

 as the customer takes possession of our product at the point of shipment.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;In&#13;the event a customer claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent on behalf of the customer
 may file a claim&#13;for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an agent on behalf of its customers
 but&#13;may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper keeps the damaged product.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;Company will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the Company receives reimbursement&#13;or credit from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an accrual for returns for&#13;damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company estimates that
 based on historical&#13;trends

 the Company will accept those two types of items back as returns. The amount for these two&#13;types of returns are estimated




 the Company&#13;will agree to reimburse the reseller for a portion of the costs incurred by the reseller to advertise and promote certain of the&#13;Company&amp;#146;s products.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company estimates

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]
        


        
Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) conducts
wholesale coffee operations
 including manufacturing
 roasting
 packaging
 marketing and distributing roasted and blended coffees
for private labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green coffee.&#160;&#160;The Company&#146;s core product
 coffee
can be summarized and divided into three product categories (&#147;product lines&#148;) as follows:

&#160;&#160;unroasted
raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large and small roasters and coffee shop operators;

 coffee roasted
 blended
packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets that want to have their own brand name on
coffee to compete with national brands; and

 coffee roasted and blended to
the Company&#146;s own specifications and packaged and sold under the Company&#146;s seven proprietary and licensed brand names
in different segments of the market.


are primarily to customers that are located throughout the United States with limited sales in Canada and the Far East.&#160;&#160;Such
customers include supermarkets
 wholesalers
 and individually-owned and multi-unit retailers.&#160;&#160;The Company&#146;s unprocessed
green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is sold primarily to specialty gourmet roasters and to coffee
shop operators in the United States with limited sales in Australia
 Canada
 England and China.


 private label
 and branded
coffee product categories generate revenues and cost of sales individually but incur selling
 general and administrative expenses
in the aggregate. There are no individual product managers and discrete financial information is not available for any of the product
lines. The Company&#146;s product portfolio is used in one business and it operates and competes in one business activity and
economic environment. In addition
 the three product lines share customers
 manufacturing resources
 sales channels
 and marketing
support. Thus
 the Company considers the three product lines to be one single reporting segment.


 2012
 the Company entered into a stock purchase
agreement with Healthwise Gourmet Coffees
 LLC (&#147;HGC&#148;) to purchase an additional 10% interest in HGC.&#160;&#160;HGC
is a coffee distributor specializing in a TechnoRoasting process that results in a coffee with lower acidity levels.&#160;&#160;The
Company invested $100
000 for the additional 10% interest.&#160;&#160;Previously
 the Company was awarded a 10% interest in HGC
in return for setting up the production process in Colorado as well as other technical support.


 2011
 the Company entered into a stock purchase
agreement with Global Mark LLC
 Peter Schmalfeld and Lawrence Elsie to purchase a 40% interest in Global Mark LLC (&#147;GM&#148;).&#160;&#160;The
terms of the agreement provided for the Company to pay up to an aggregate of $2
000
000 in cash to fund operations and for GM to
provide to the Company a preferred pricing arrangement for the supply of instant coffee.&#160;&#160;On December 10
 2012
 the Company
entered into an agreement with GM and other members of GM
 whereby the Company withdrew as a member of GM.&#160;&#160;As a result
of GM&#146;s inability to successfully develop a significant customer base (other than the Company) and the Company&#146;s evaluation
of the long term prospects of the GM relationship
 the Company determined that it was in the best interests of the parties to terminate
the relationship.&#160;&#160;In connection with withdrawing from GM
 the Company received assets comprised of cash
 receivables
and inventory equal to approximately $1.8 million
 resulting in a write down of approximately $130
000
 which was recognized as
of October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2013
 the Company received the final accounting of
the GM business.&#160;&#160;The amount of cash received was approximately $104
000 less than originally expected
 resulting in
the final write down that was recognized as of January 31
 2013.


 2010
 the Company entered into an asset purchase
agreement with Organic Products Trading Company
 Inc. to purchase certain assets.&#160;&#160;The Company formed a wholly-owned
subsidiary Coffee Holding&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Acquisition Company
 LLC to purchase the assets. Subsequent to the closing
 the
Company changed the name of the subsidiary to Organic Products Trading Company
 LLC (&#147;OPTCO&#148;).&#160;&#160;The financial
statements of OPTCO are consolidated with those of the Company.


 2006
 the Company entered into a joint venture
with Caruso&#146;s Coffee
 Inc. and formed Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&#147;GCC&#148;).&#160;&#160;The Company now owns
a 60% equity interest in GCC.&#160;&#160;GCC operates the facility located in Brecksville
 Ohio and is in the same general business
as the Company.&#160;&#160;The Company also exercises control of GCC.&#160;&#160;As a result of its 60% equity interest and control
of GCC
 the financial statements of GCC are consolidated with those of the Company.

 and so forth) which are highly liquid (that is
 readily convertible to known amounts of cash) and so near their maturity that they present an insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally
 only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify as cash equivalents by definition. Original maturity means an original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.

provide a series of conditions
 related to the potential for net cash settlement
 which must be met in order to achieve equity
classification. Management evaluated the terms and conditions of the Warrants and determined that i) the Warrants did not embody
any of the conditions for liability classification under ASC 480 and ii) they were considered to be solely indexed to the

for equity classification set forth in ASC 815. Accordingly
 the Warrants achieved equity classification at inception. The classification
of the Warrants will be re-evaluated each reporting period.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
 not adjusted
for transaction costs.&#160;&#160;The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3) as described below:


markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company;


active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable
 either directly or indirectly;


liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants.


as follows:


and deferred compensation plan assets.


plan.&#160;&#160;The fair value of the plan assets are classified within Level 1 as the assets are valued using quoted prices
in active markets.&#160;&#160;The assets are included with Deposits and other assets in the accompanying balance sheets.
Additional information related to the Company&#146;s deferred compensation plan is disclosed in Note 10.


Level 2 and include coffee futures and options contracts. To determine fair value
 the Company utilizes the market approach valuation
technique for the coffee futures and options contracts.&#160;&#160;The Company uses Level 2 inputs that are based on market data
of similar instruments that are in observable markets. All commodities on the balance sheet are recorded at fair value with changes
in fair value included in earnings.


liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

On February 17
 2009
 the Company entered into a financing

is a revolving $5
000
000 line of credit and the Company can draw on the line at an amount up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable
and 25% of eligible inventory consisting of green coffee beans and finished coffee not to exceed $1
000
000.&#160;&#160;Sterling
shall have the right from time to time to adjust the foregoing percentages based upon
 among other things
 dilution
 its sole determination
of the value or likelihood of collection of eligible accounts receivables owed to the Company
 considerations regarding inventory.&#160;&#160;The
credit facility is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal to
a per annum reference rate (4.25% at October 31
 2013 and 2012).


 2010
 the credit facility was increased to $7
000
000.&#160;&#160;In
addition
 OPTCO was added as a co-borrower and the inventory sublimit was raised from $1
000
000 to $2

to July 31
 2010
 $1
800
000 of the credit facility was allocated to OPTCO.


and expired on February 17
 2012.&#160;&#160;The initial terms of the credit facility provided that the credit facility may be
automatically extended for successive periods of one year each unless one party shall have provided the other party with a written
notice of termination at least ninety days prior to the expiration of the then current term.&#160;&#160;Prior to the expiration
of the initial term
 and effective as of February 12
 2012
 the term was extended until February 17
 2014 and the interest rate
was reduced to the Wall Street Journal Prime rate (which is currently 3.25%) plus one percent (1%).&#160;&#160;On May 10
 2013
the credit facility was extended until February 17
 2015.&#160;&#160;The credit facility is secured by all tangible and intangible
assets of the Company.

 2013 and 2012
 the company has approximately
$2
500
000 and $0 respectively
 of federal and state net operating loss (&#147;NOLs&#148;) carryovers available to offset future
taxable income
 which expire beginning in October 31
 2033.&#160;&#160;In accordance with section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code
deductibility of the Company&#146;s net operating loss carryovers may be subject to annual limitations in the event of a change
in control.

&#160;A valuation allowance was not provided at October 31
 2013 or 2012.&#160;&#160;In assessing the realizability of deferred
tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized.&#160;&#160;The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.&#160;&#160;Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.&#160;&#160;Based
upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax
assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these
deductible differences.&#160;&#160;The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable
 however
 could be reduced in the
near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.


 2013 and 2012
 the Company did not have
any unrecognized tax benefits or open tax positions.&#160;&#160;The Company&#146;s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties
related to income tax matters in income tax expense.&#160;&#160;As of October 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company had no accrued interest
or penalties related to income taxes.&#160;&#160;The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress.

Approximately 60% of the Company&#146;s sales were derived
from one customer during the year ended October 31
 2013.&#160;&#160;This customer also accounted for approximately $6
277
000
or 51% of the Company&#146;s accounts&#160;&#160; receivable balance at October 31
 2013.&#160;&#160;&#160;Approximately 62% of
the Company&#146;s sales were derived from one customer during the year ended October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;This customer also
accounted for approximately $6
257
000 or 49% of the Company&#146;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Concentration
of credit risk with respect to other trade receivables is limited due to the short payment terms generally extended by the Company
by ongoing credit evaluations of customers
 and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts and other allowances that management
believes will adequately provide for credit losses.


 2013
 approximately 75% of
the Company&#146;s purchases were from ten vendors.&#160;&#160;&#160;Two of these vendors accounted for 53% of total purchases.&#160;&#160;These
two vendors accounted for approximately $4
122
000 of the Company&#146;s accounts payable at October 31
 2013.&#160;&#160;For
the year ended October 31
 2012
 approximately 80% of the Company&#146;s purchases were from ten vendors.&#160;&#160;Two of these
vendors accounted for 49% of total purchases.&#160;&#160;These two&#160;vendors accounted for approximately $6
095
000 of the Company&#146;s
accounts payable at October 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Management does not believe the loss of any one vendor would have a material adverse
effect of the Company&#146;s operations due to the availability of many alternate suppliers.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]
        


        
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company
 OPTCO and GCC.&#160;&#160;All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


        
The preparation of the Company&#146;s financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that&#160;&#160; affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.&#160;&#160;Significant estimates include
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and reserves
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 intangible asset valuations
and useful lives
 taxes
 contingencies
 and valuation of financial instruments. These estimates may be adjusted as more current
information becomes available
 and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts.


        
Cash consists primarily of unrestricted cash on deposit at
financial institutions and brokerage firms.


        
Prepaid coffee is an item that emanates from OPTCO.&#160;&#160;The
balance represents advance payments made by OPTCO to several coffee growing cooperatives for the purchase of green coffee.&#160;&#160;Interest
is charged to the cooperatives for these advances.&#160;&#160;Interest earned was $35
564 and $21
857 as of October 31
 2013 and
2012
 respectively.&#160;&#160;The prepaid coffee balance was $439
290 and $150
000 as of October 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.


        
Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company
expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectibility of specific
customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current economic industry trends
 and
changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectibility.
If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#146;s assessment
 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible
amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.


that customers will take upon payment.&#160;&#160;The reserve for other allowances represents the estimated amount of returns
slotting fees and volume based&#160;&#160;&#160; discounts estimated to be incurred by the Company from its customers.&#160;&#160;The
allowances are summarized as follows:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in
 first
out basis) or market
 including provisions for obsolescence commensurate with known or estimated exposures.


        
Machinery and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.&#160;&#160;Purchases of machinery and equipment and
additions and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized at cost.&#160;&#160;Expenditures
which do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred.&#160;&#160;The Company
also provides for amortization of leasehold improvements.


        
The commodities held at broker represent the market value
of the Company&#146;s trading account
 which consists of option and future contracts for coffee held with a brokerage firm.&#160;&#160;The
Company uses options and futures contracts
 which are not designated or qualifying as hedging instruments
 to partially hedge the
effects of fluctuations in the price of green coffee beans.&#160;&#160;Options and futures contracts are recognized at fair value
in the consolidated financial statements with current recognition of gains and losses on such positions.&#160;&#160;The Company's
accounting for options and futures contracts may increase earnings volatility in any particular period.

 unrealized holding gains and losses are included in earnings.


 2013
 the Company held 149 futures contracts
(generally with terms of three to four months) for the purchase of 5
587
500 pounds of green coffee at a weighted average price
of $1.19 per pound.&#160;&#160;The fair market value of coffee applicable to such contracts was $1.08 per pound at that date. The
Company also held 120 options (generally with terms of two months or less) covering an aggregate of 4
500
000 pounds of green coffee
beans at $1.10 per pound.&#160;&#160;The fair market value of these options
 which was obtained from observable market data of
similar instruments was $244

 2012
 the Company held 319 futures contracts
(generally with terms of three to four months) for the purchase of 11
962
500 pounds of green coffee at a weighted average price
of $1.66 and $1.86 per pound.&#160;&#160;The fair market value of coffee applicable to such contracts was $1.55 to $1.65 per pound
at that date.


2013 and 2012
 the Company recorded realized and unrealized gains and losses respectively
 on these contracts as follows:

The Company has determined that its goodwill and trademarks
which consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have an indefinite useful life.&#160;&#160;The value of the goodwill
and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation.&#160;&#160;Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized but are assigned
to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event or when
circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&#146;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair value.&#160;&#160;As
of October 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company has determined that an impairment did not exist.




 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard
ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other &#150; Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first
assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.&#160;&#160;Under
this amendment
 an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based
on a qualitative assessment
 that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment
includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.&#160;&#160;There
was no material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition upon adoption of the new standard.



        
The Company&#146;s customer lists and relationships consist
of specific customer lists and customer contracts obtained by the Company in the acquisition of OPTCO which are being amortized
on the straight-line method over&#160;&#160; their estimated useful life of twenty years.


        
The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotion
as incurred.&#160;&#160;Advertising costs charged to operations totaled $169
853 and $85
382 for the years ended October 31
 2013
and 2012
 respectively.


        
income taxes pursuant
deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed for temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts
in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
income.&#160;&#160;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current or non-current based on their characteristics.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.&#160;&#160;The
income tax provision or benefit is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets
and liabilities.


        
Basic earnings per common share were computed by dividing
net income by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.&#160;&#160;&#160;Diluted earnings per common
share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect
of common shares issuable upon exercise of potential sources of dilution.


computation of basic earnings per share were 6

 2013 and 2012.&#160;&#160;The weighted average
common shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share were 6
372
309 and 6
639
309 at October 31
 2013
and 2012
 respectively.&#160;&#160;The 267
000 shares that could be exercised pursuant to the warrant agreement attached to the
units issued in September 2011 have been included in the October 31
 2012 diluted earnings per share calculation because of their
dilutive impact.

The carrying amounts of cash
 accounts receivable
 notes receivable
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.&#160;&#160;The
carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at which
the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities.&#160;&#160;Fair value estimates are made at a specific point
in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available.&#160;&#160;These estimates are subjective
in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
 cannot be determined with precision.&#160;&#160;Changes
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.


        
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the authoritative
guidance.&#160;&#160;Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers upon the Company&#146;s
shippers taking possession of the goods at the time of shipment because i) title passes in accordance with the terms of the Company&#146;s
purchase orders and with its agreements with its customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered by the Company&#146;s customers&#146;

 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is determinable and v) collection of the
resulting receivable is reasonably assured.&#160;&#160;Thus
 revenue is recognized at the point of shipment to its customers.

During the first quarter
 the Financial Accounting Standards
Board has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-11

and Liabilities
to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.&#160;&#160;The
amendments in this guidance are effective for the Company for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after January 1
2013
 and interim periods within those annual periods. Management is still evaluating the effects of adoption.


2012-02
 This ASU
states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances
indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If
 after assessing the totality
of events and circumstances
 an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset
is impaired
 then the entity is not required to take further action. However
 if an entity concludes otherwise
 then it is required
to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing
the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with Codification Subtopic 350-30

 General
Intangibles Other than Goodwill.


 an entity also has the
option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to
performing the quantitative impairment test. An entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any
subsequent period.&#160;&#160;The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for
fiscal years beginning after September 15
 2012. Early adoption is permitted
 including for annual and interim impairment
tests performed as of a date before July 27
 2012
 if a public entity&#146;s financial statements for the most recent annual
or interim period have not yet been issued or
 for nonpublic entities
 have not yet been made available for
issuance.&#160;&#160;There has not been a material effect to the Company.


 the Financial Accounting and Standards Board


of Disclosure about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. The ASU clarifies disclosures required for derivatives accounted for in
accordance with Topic 815
 Derivatives and Hedging
 including bifurcated embedded derivatives
 repurchase agreements
 and securities
borrowing and lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with Section 310-20-45 or Section 815-10-46 or subject
to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning
after January 1
 2013. The Company adopted this guidance in 2013 without material impact on its financial position
 results of
operations or cash flows.
