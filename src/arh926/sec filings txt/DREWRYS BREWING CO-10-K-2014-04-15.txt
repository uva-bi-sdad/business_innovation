company developing beer-type products and selling them to beer distributors and wholesalers who will in turn sell the products
to retailers for sales to consumers. The Company is based in McHenry
 Illinois. The Company was started by Francis Manzo and incorporated
in Nevada on October 11
 2010.

 Holihan&rsquo;s and Canadian Ace from its president and two entities controlled
by him.


(Chicago
 Illinois and South Bend
 Indiana) with a heritage dating back to 1878 and was distributed in Indiana
 Illinois
Iowa
 Michigan
 Ohio
 and Wisconsin. In the early 1960&rsquo;s
 it was the 15
 largest brewery at that time and was a publicly traded entity known as Drewrys USA Ltd.. Drewrys was then
acquired by Associated Brewing Company of Detroit
 Michigan who was then subsequently acquired by the G. Heileman Brewing
Company in La Crosse
 Wisconsin. The Company&rsquo;s research indicates that Heileman Brewing filed bankruptcy in 1991 and
went out of business in 1996. Eventual brewery mergers
 bankruptcies and the competitive nature of the beer industry saw the
brand decline in volume until it was eliminated from the retail  market by the late 1990&rsquo;s.

 Inc. of Lawrence
 Massachusetts. The history of this brand is not widely known
 but it is believed that it was last sold
in the 1960-1970&rsquo;s period.


the Manhattan Brewing Company and the label was then subsequently acquired by other small brewers prior to them going out of business.
Beer sold under the Canadian Ace label was last sold in the early 1970&rsquo;s
 and has not been seen on the market since. Canadian
Ace was a beer considered controlled by Al Capone during the 1920&rsquo;s and 1930&rsquo;s.


 Frank Manzo
 investigated
and researched beers that had ceased production due to bankruptcy or business failures. After investigating the background of these
various beers
 Mr. Manzo
 individually and through wholly-owned companies filed for the trademarks of these discontinued
beer names. After incorporating Drewrys
 these trademarks were transferred to the Company at the same cost each paid for their
respective trademarks
 $275.00 each for Drewrys and Holihan
 and $10 for Canadian Ace. The Company has no affiliation and no agreements
with the prior owners of the trademarks or names and believes that they all went out of business more than 30 years ago. As such
the Company does not believe that it is necessary to have any agreements with the prior owners since none of them can be located.


 Inc. is developing
beers for the domestic beer market. The Company will brew under the trade names DREWRYS
 HOLIHAN&rsquo;S and CANADIAN ACE. DREWRYS
is targeted for the domestic budget or low-priced beer market. HOLIHAN&rsquo;S is targeted for the &quot;craft beer&quot; segment
and is anticipated to be a full-flavored beer brewed in the traditional style. The CANADIAN ACE brand may be developed as a malt
beverage imported from a contract brewer located in Canada.. The Company's objective is to provide excellent tasting beers for
the market segment that it would target. The Company&rsquo;s CEO obtained the trademarks for &ldquo;DREWRYS&rdquo;
 &ldquo;HOLIHAN&rsquo;S&rdquo;
and &ldquo;CANADIAN ACE&rdquo; and transferred and assigned these trademarks to the Company for consideration totaling $560
 the
actual cost of obtaining the trademarks.


and craft beer segment of the US market.




independent distributors for its wholesale sales. The distributors that the Company relies upon may also market competing
imported and domestic craft beers. Although by law distributors are independent of any brewer
 a distributor can be
controlled if it relies on one or two large brewers who account for the majority of its sales. The Company does not have
any formal written distribution agreements with any distributors at this time.

the most significant portion of our promotion and advertising activities. This will include sampling programs

 Wisconsin and Kentucky being the initial markets. The Company
will engage a contract brewer who will maintain the federal and state licenses necessary to produce and/or sell

anticipates that if it were to produce and sell beer in the states noted

produce its beers. An Alternative Brewer brings in its own raw materials and packaging supplies. At such time the owner of the
brewing facility is just leasing its premises to the Alternative Brewer.


 the 21st Amendment to the United
States Constitution repealed Prohibition and also gave states the authority to regulate the production
 importation
 distribution
sale
 and consumption of alcohol beverages within their own borders. A new regulatory system known as the Three-Tier System was
created. This system was established to eliminate tied-house abuses. As such
 the &quot;Tied-houses&quot; would no longer exist
and as a result beer would be sold through independent distributors.


the three-tier system
 the separation of the three-tiers by inserting an independent distributor between the brewers and the retailers
is a common thread. The three tiers (brewer
 distributor
 and retailer) are also further separated by other laws and regulations
prohibiting suppliers and distributors from having any financial interest or influence with retailers - for example
 beer sales
on credit are not allowed and consignment sales are banned.

we would experience additional losses from the write-down of assets.

the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company

 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances

financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining

 Income Taxes
at its inception. Under ASC 740
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets
 including tax loss and credit carry forwards
 and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their
characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized
as of December 31
 2013 and 2012.

that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management
 including our President and Treasurer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures
 management recognized that any controls and procedures
 no
matter how well designed and operated
 can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives
 and in
reaching a reasonable level of assurance
 management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.


 we carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our
fiscal year covered by this report. Based on the foregoing
 our President and sole director concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level. We anticipate expanding the Board to include additional members
in the 2014 year at which time we expect the effectiveness of our controls and procedures to be adequate.

FINANCIAL REPORTING


and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule
13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by
 or under the supervision
of
 the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's sole board of director
 management
and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
includes those policies and procedures that:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    

 use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



 internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems
 no matter how well designed
 have inherent limitations.


 even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of
the inherent limitations of internal control
 there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial
reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk.


    
    


 2013
 management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (&quot;COSO&quot;) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation
 he concluded that
 during
the period covered by this report
 such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application
of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to having a sole individual in charge of the business and have limited
internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material
weaknesses.


procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority
of outside directors on our board of directors
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) having only one
individual in both management and on the board of directors: and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure
and reporting processes.


identified by our President and sole director in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31
 2013.


above could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.




weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls
 we have initiated
 or plan to initiate
 the following series
of measures:


consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting
function when funds are available to us. And
 we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall
be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management
when funds are available to us.

NOTE 2.&#9;SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
PRACTICES




been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#147;US GAAP&#148;).




conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

 respectively of costs related to registering our trademarks
 have been capitalized. It has been determined that
the trademarks have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortization. However
 the trademarks will be reviewed for
impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.




assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05
 &#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.&#148; ASC
Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets
 such as our trademarks
 be reviewed for impairment annually
 or whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company
assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the
asset
 including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset
 an impairment
loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset&#146;s carrying value and fair value or disposable value. No impairments
were recorded for years ended December 31
 2013
 and for the year ended December 31
 2012.

for doubtful accounts.&#160;&#160;On a periodic basis
 we evaluate our accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for doubtful
accounts based on our history of past write-offs and collections and current credit conditions.&#160;&#160;Specific customer accounts
are written off as uncollectible if the probability of a future loss has been established
 collection efforts have been exhausted
and payment is not expected to be received.&#160;&#160;As of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 no allowance for bad debts was required.

payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during the periods shown
 and none are contemplated in the near future.




accordance with ASC 260
 &#147;Earnings Per Share&#148;. Under the provisions of ASC 260
 basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common
and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.&#160;&#160;There were no potentially dilutive common shares
outstanding during the period.




 Income Taxes
at its inception. Under ASC 740
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets
 including tax loss and credit carry forwards
 and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their
characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized
as of December 31
 2013 and 2012.

 which establishes a framework
for measuring fair value in U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability
in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 it establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy of valuation techniques based
on observable and unobservable inputs
 which may be used to measure fair value and include the following:

 Quoted market prices available
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
 Pricing inputs other than quoted
prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
 Pricing inputs that are generally
observable inputs and are not corroborated by market data.


financial assets and liabilities
 such as cash
 accounts payable
 and accrued expenses
 approximate their fair values because of
the short maturity of these instruments.

 the Company did not have any fair value adjustments
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 nor gains or losses are reported in the statements
of operations that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to those assets and liabilities still held
at the reporting date for the years ended December 31

 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]
        


        
        


been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company has an accumulated
deficit of $434
863 and a negative working capital. In view of these matters
 recoverability of any asset amounts shown in the
accompanying financial statements is dependent upon the Company's ability to continue increase sales and operations and to achieve
a level of profitability. Since inception
 the Company has financed its activities principally from the sale of equity securities.
The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from loans and the sale
of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources
 including term notes
 until
such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.




        
          

        
          
            

 (b) the possible effects of such conditions and events
 (c) management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions and events and any mitigating factors
 (d) possible discontinuance of operations
 (e) management's plans (including relevant prospective financial information)
 and (f) information about the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities. If management's plans alleviate the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern
 disclosure of the principal conditions and events that initially raised the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern would be expected to be considered. Disclose whether operations for the current or prior years generated sufficient cash to cover current obligations
 whether waivers were obtained from creditors relating to the company's default under the provisions of debt agreements and possible effects of such conditions and events
 such as: whether there is a possible need to obtain additional financing (debt or equity) or to liquidate certain holdings to offset future cash flow deficiencies. Disclose appropriate parent company information when parent is dependent upon remittances from subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations.

 &#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.&#148; ASC
Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets
 such as our trademarks
 be reviewed for impairment annually
 or whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company
assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the
asset
 including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset
 an impairment
loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset&#146;s carrying value and fair value or disposable value. No impairments
were recorded for years ended December 31
 2013

 Income Taxes
at its inception. Under ASC 740
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets
 including tax loss and credit carry forwards
 and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their
characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized
as of December 31
 2013 and 2012.
