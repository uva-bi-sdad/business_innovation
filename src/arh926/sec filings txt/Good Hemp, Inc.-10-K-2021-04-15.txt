 our core market. The United States has more than 2
600 beverage companies and 500 bottlers of beverage products. Collectively they account for more than $100 billion in annual sales. It is estimated that globally more than $300 billion worth of non-alcoholic beverages are sold annually. The beverage market is controlled by two giants
 The Coca-Cola Company (&#8220;Coke&#8221;) and PepsiCo
 combining for over 70% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. Carbonated beverage sales are slipping
Bottled water maintains a steady growth pace
 size is expected to reach USD 505.19 billion by 2028
 according to a new report by Grand View Research
 Inc. It is expected to expand at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2021 to 2028. The growing awareness regarding the adverse health effects of consuming sugary drinks
 such as weight gain
 obesity
 diabetes
 and heart disease
 is supporting the consumption of alternative beverages
The growth of the market is primarily attributed to rising awareness regarding the importance of hydration. According to a study conducted by the International Bottled Water Association in 2018
Increasing preference for nutrient-fortified water is trending owing to the rising importance of health and wellness among buyers. Bottled water demand has been increasing among travelers
 working professionals
Since the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill
 there has been a significant boost in CBD store fronts
 both brick and mortar

 total sales of hemp-derived CBD consumer products in the U.S. were approximately $1.2 billion. In the last year
Direct Store Delivery (&#8220;DSD&#8221;) &#8211; DSD players
 and regional and local distributors touch over 90% of retail chains in the US. DSDs primarily distribute beverages
 chips
 snacks and milk and provide pre-sales
 delivery and merchandising services to their customers. Service levels are daily and weekly
Direct to Retail Channel (&#8220;Warehouse Direct&#8221;) &#8211; We are targeting listings with large retail convenience store and grocery store chains where we ship direct to the chain stores warehousing system. Retailers must have warehousing and delivery capabilities. Services to retailers will be provided by an assigned broker
 approved by us
 to oversee pre-sale and merchandising services. Our direct to retail channel of distribution is an important part of our strategy to target large national or regional restaurant chains
 retail accounts
 including mass merchandisers and premier food-service businesses. Through these programs
 we will negotiate directly with the retailer to carry our products
Direct to Consumer &#8211; Our brands are available for direct retail purchase on Amazon and Goodhemplivin.com. Additionally
Our strategy is to outsource the manufacturing and warehousing of our products to independent contract manufacturers (&#8220;co-packers&#8221;). We purchase our raw materials from North American suppliers which deliver to our third-party co-packers. We use two or more co-packers to manufacture and package our products. Once our products are manufactured
 we store finished product in a warehouse adjacent to each co-packer or in third party warehouses. Our co-packers have been chosen based on their proximity to markets covered by our distributors. Most of the ingredients used in the formulation of our products are off-the shelf and thus readily available. Under normal circumstances
 no ingredient has a lead time greater than three-to-six weeks. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production run for most co-packers
 we do not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. Our co-packers may terminate their arrangements with us at any time
Substantially all the raw materials used in the preparation
 bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers in accordance with our specifications. The raw materials used in the preparation and packaging of our products consists primarily of juice concentrates
 natural flavors
 stevia
 pure cane sugar
 bottles
 labels
 trays and enclosures. These raw materials are purchased from suppliers selected by us or by our contract manufacturers. We believe that we have adequate sources of raw materials
We purchase our flavor concentrate from several flavor concentrate suppliers. Generally
 all natural flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to the flavors. The development of new products and flavors
 independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense for product development
 thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. We anticipate that for future flavors and additional products
 we may purchase flavor concentrate from other flavor houses with the intention of developing other sources of flavor concentrate for each of our products. If we must replace a flavor supplier
 we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers
Our product philosophy will continue to be based on developing products in those segments of the market that offer the greatest chance of success such as health
 wellness and natural refreshment and rehydration
 and we will continue to seek out underserved market niches. We believe we can quickly respond
 given our technical and marketing expertise
 to changing market conditions with new and innovative products. We are committed to developing products that are distinct
 meet a quantifiable need
 are proprietary
 lend themselves to a markup on production costs of least a 60%
 project a quality and healthy image
We own the following intellectual property: Good Hemp&#174; trademark

Our sales are expected to be seasonal and experience fluctuations in quarterly results because of many factors. Historically
 the industry experiences an increase in revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. Thus
As of December 31
 2020
The Company&#8217;s office is located at 20311 Chartwell Center Drive
 Ste. 1469
 Cornelius
 North Carolina
We have experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to our ongoing operations and generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The size of our losses will depend
 in part
 on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenues. We incurred a net loss of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31
 2020
 and our accumulated deficit increased to approximately $8.4 million as of December 31
We may encounter unforeseen expenses
 difficulties
 complications
 delays
 and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our financial condition. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had
 and will continue to have
 an adverse effect on our financial condition. If our products do not achieve sufficient market acceptance and our revenues do not increase significantly
 we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future
 we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital
 expand our business
If we are not able to successfully execute on our future operating plans
 our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected
It is critical that we meet our sales goals and increase sales going forward as our operating plan already reflects prior significant cost containment measures and may make it difficult to achieve top-line growth if further significant reductions become necessary. If we do not meet our sales goals
We may need additional financing in the future
We will require additional financing to support our working capital needs in the future. The amount of additional capital we may require
 the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors
 including our strategic initiatives and operating plans
 the performance of our business and the market conditions for debt or equity financing. Additionally
 the amount of capital required will depend on our ability to meet our sales goals and otherwise successfully execute our operating plan. We believe it is imperative that we meet these sales objectives in order to lessen our reliance on external financing in the future. We intend to continually monitor and adjust our operating plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business
 our markets and the broader economy. Although we believe various debt and equity financing alternatives will be available to us to support our working capital needs
 financing arrangements on acceptable terms may not be available to us when needed. Additionally
 these alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any such financing alternatives may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements. If necessary
 we may explore strategic transactions that we consider to be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders
 which may include
 without limitation
 public or private offerings of debt or equity securities
 a rights offering
 and other strategic alternatives; however
If we are unable to continue as a going concern
Although our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2020
 were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern
 the report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2020
 contains a going concern qualification in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
 based on the financial statements at that time. Specifically
 as noted above
 we have experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities
 and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. These prior losses and expected future losses have had
 and will continue to have
 an adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition
 as noted above
 continued operations and our ability to continue as a going concern may be dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing in the near future and thereafter
 and there are no assurances that such financing will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to generate additional funds in the future through sales of our products
 financings or from other sources or transactions
 we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a going concern
The Company
 while incorporated in 2007
 began carrying on its current beverage business in 2019 and did not generate revenue from the sale of products until that year. We are therefore subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises
 including under-capitalization
 cash shortages
 limitations with respect to personnel
 financial
 and other resources and lack of revenues. There is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders&#8217; investment
There is no assurance that we will not incur debt in the future
 that we will have sufficient funds to repay our indebtedness
 or that we will not default on our debt
 jeopardizing our business viability. Furthermore
We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious
Our business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our target market: trendy
 young and/or health-conscious consumers looking for a distinctive tonality and/or the perceived benefits of hemp in their beverage choices. In addition
 our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors and retailers of our brands as beverage brands that have the potential to provide incremental sales growth. If we are not successful in the growth of our brand and product offerings
 we may not achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. In addition
Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products and effectively build up brand image for new products and brand extensions. We cannot predict whether our advertising
 marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products&#8217; branding and on consumer preferences. In addition
 negative public relations and product quality issues
 including negative perceptions regarding the hemp industry
 whether real or imagined
 could tarnish our reputation and image of the affected brands and could cause consumers to choose other products. Our brand image can also be adversely affected by unfavorable reports
 studies and articles
 litigation
 or regulatory or other governmental action
Competition from traditional and large
 well-financed non-alcoholic beverage manufacturers may adversely affect our distribution relationships and may hinder development of our existing markets
The beverage industry is highly competitive. We compete with other beverage companies not only for consumer acceptance but also for shelf space in retail outlets and for marketing focus by our distributors
 all of whom also distribute other beverage brands. Our products compete with all non-alcoholic beverages
Our direct competitors in the sparkling
 flavored-water
 and energy drink beverage categories include traditional large beverage companies and distributors
 and regional premium soft and energy drink companies. These national and international competitors have advantages such as lower production costs
 larger marketing budgets
 greater financial and other resources and more developed and extensive distribution networks than ours. We may not be able to grow our volumes or maintains our selling prices
Increased competitor consolidations
 market-place competition
 particularly among branded beverage products
 and competitive product and pricing pressures could impact our earnings
 market share and volume growth. If
 due to such pressure or other competitive threats
 we are unable to sufficiently maintain or develop our distribution channels
 we may be unable to achieve our current revenue and financial targets. As a means of maintaining and expanding our distribution network
 we intend to introduce product extensions and additional brands. We may not be successful in doing this
 or it may take us longer than anticipated to achieve market acceptance of these new products and brands
 if at all. Other companies may be more successful in this regard over the long term. Competition
 particularly from companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours
 could have a material adverse effect on our existing markets
We compete in an industry characterized by rapid changes in consumer preferences and public perception
Failure to introduce new brands
 products or product extensions into the marketplace as current ones mature and to meet our consumers&#8217; changing preferences could prevent us from gaining market share and achieving long-term profitability. Product lifecycles can vary
 and consumers&#8217; preferences and loyalties change over time. Although we try to anticipate these shifts and innovate new products to introduce to our consumers
 we may not succeed. Customer preferences also are affected by factors other than taste
 such as health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns
 shifting consumer needs
 changes in consumer lifestyles
 increased consumer information and competitive product and pricing pressures. Sales of our products may be adversely affected by the negative publicity associated with these issues. In addition
 there may be a decreased demand for our products as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. If we do not adequately anticipate or adjust to respond to these and other changes in customer preferences
Consumers are concerned about health and wellness; public health officials and government officials are increasingly vocal about obesity and its consequences. There has been a trend among some public health advocates and dietary guidelines to recommend a reduction in sweetened beverages
 as well as increased public scrutiny
 new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (as described below)
 and additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing and labeling/packing of the beverage industry. Additional or revised regulatory requirements
 whether labeling
 tax or otherwise
 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further
Legislative or regulatory changes that affect our products
including new taxes
Taxes imposed on the sale of certain of our products by federal
 state
 and local governments in the United States
 or other countries in which we operate could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing our beverages. Several municipalities in the United States have implemented or are considering implementing taxes on the sale of certain &#8220;sugared&#8221; beverages
 including non-diet soft drinks
 fruit drinks
 energy drinks
 teas
 and flavored waters to help fund various initiatives. These taxes could materially affect our business and financial results as we current sell flavored water beverages
 sparkling beverages
cannabis
As of December 31
 2020
 approximately forty-eight states authorized industrial hemp programs pursuant to the 2018 farm bill (the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018
 the &#8220;2018 Farm Bill&#8221;)
The 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law on December 20
 2018. The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (the &#8220;CSA&#8221;) and established a federal regulatory framework for hemp production in the United States. Among other provisions
 the 2018 Farm Bill: (a) explicitly amends the CSA to exclude all parts of the cannabis plant (including its cannabinoids
 derivatives
 and extracts) containing a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis from the CSA&#8217;s definition of &#8220;marihuana&#8221;; (b) permits the commercial production and sale of hemp; (c) precludes states
 territories
 and Indian tribes from prohibiting the interstate transport of lawfully-produced hemp through their borders; and (d) establishes the USDA as the primary federal agency regulating the cultivation of hemp in the United States
 while allowing states
 territories
 and Indian tribes to obtain (or retain) primary regulatory authority over hemp activities within their borders after receiving approval of their proposed hemp production plan from the USDA. Any such plan submitted by a state
 territory
 or Indian tribe to the USDA must meet or exceed minimum federal standards and receive USDA approval. Any state
 territory
 or Indian tribe that does not submit a plan to the USDA
 or whose plan is not approved by the USDA
 will be regulated by the USDA; provided that
Marijuana continues to be classified as a Schedule I substance under the CSA. As a result
 any cannabinoids (including CBD) derived from marijuana
 as opposed to hemp
 or any products derived from hemp containing in excess of 0.3% THC on a dry-weight basis
 remain Schedule I substances under U.S. federal law. Cannabinoids derived from hemp are indistinguishable from those derived from marijuana
 and confusion surrounding the nature of our beverage products containing CBD and any hemp we cultivate and sale in connection with our joint venture with Hervey to cultivate hemp
 inconsistent interpretations of the definition of &#8220;hemp&#8221;
 inaccurate or incomplete testing
 farming practices and law enforcement vigilance or lack of education could result in our products being intercepted by federal and state law enforcement as marijuana and could interrupt and/or have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business. The Company could be required to undertake processes that could delay shipments
 impede sales or result in seizures
 proper or improper
 that would be costly to rectify or remove and which could have a material adverse effect on the business
 prospects
 results of operations or financial condition of the Company. If the Company mistakes in processing or labeling and THC in excess of 0.3% on a dry-weight basis was found in our products
 the Company could be subject to enforcement and prosecution under local
 state
Under the 2018 Farm Bill
 states have authority to adopt their own regulatory regimes
 and as such
 regulations will likely continue to vary on a state-by-state basis. States take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of hemp and hemp-derived products under state food and drug laws. The variance in state law and that state laws governing hemp production are rapidly changing may increase the chance of unfavorable law enforcement interpretation of the legality of Company&#8217;s operations as they relate to the cultivation of hemp. Further
While some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of hemp products or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in commercial hemp activities
 other states maintain outdated drug laws that do not distinguish between marijuana
 hemp and/or hemp-derived CBD
 resulting in hemp being classified as a controlled substance under state law. In these states
 sale of CBD
 notwithstanding origin
 is either restricted to state medical or adult-use marijuana program licensees or remains otherwise unlawful under state criminal laws. Variance in hemp regulation across jurisdictions is likely to persist. This patchwork of state laws may
 for the foreseeable future
 materially impact the Company&#8217;s business and financial condition
 limit the accessibility of certain state markets
 cause confusion amongst regulators
There are no express protections in the United States under applicable federal or state law for possessing or processing hemp biomass derived from lawful hemp not exceeding 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis and intended for use in finished product
 but that may temporarily exceed 0.3% THC during the interim processing stages. While it is a common occurrence for hemp biomass to have variance in THC content during interim processing stages after cultivation but prior to use in finished products
 there is risk that state or federal regulators or law enforcement could take the position that such hemp biomass is a Schedule I controlled substance in violation of the CSA and similar state laws. Further
In the event that the Company&#8217;s operations are deemed to violate any laws or if we are deemed to be assisting others to violate a state or federal law
 the Company could be subject to enforcement actions and penalties
Continued development of the industrial hemp and cannabis industries will be dependent upon new legislative authorization of industrial hemp and cannabis at the state level
 and further amendment or supplementation of legislation at the federal level. Any number of events or occurrences could slow or halt progress all together in this space. While progress within the industrial hemp and cannabis industries is currently encouraging
 growth is not assured. While there appears to be ample public support for favorable legislative action
 numerous factors may impact or negatively affect the legislative process(es) within the various states where we have business interests. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use of industrial hemp and cannabis
In addition
 the general manufacture
 labeling and distribution of our beverage products is regulated by various federal
 state
 and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings
 which could restrict the permissible scope of our product claims or the ability to sell products in the future. The FDA regulates our products to ensure that the products are not adulterated or misbranded. In particular
 we would be subject to regulation by the federal government and other state and local agencies as a result of the development and commercialization of cannabidiol (CBD) products. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance in multiple jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to our business
 we may be subject to penalties
 including
 without limitation
 civil and criminal penalties
 damages
 fines
 the curtailment or restructuring of our operations
We may in the future expand into other geographic areas
 which could increase our operational
 regulatory
 compliance
 reputational and foreign exchange rate risks. The failure of our operating infrastructure to support such expansion could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions. Future international expansion could require us to incur a number of up-front expenses
 including those associated with obtaining regulatory approvals
 as well as additional ongoing expenses
 including those associated with infrastructure
Our reliance on distributors
 retailers and brokers could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market our products
Our ability to maintain and expand our existing markets for our products
 and to establish markets in new geographic distribution areas
 is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with reliable distributors
 retailers and brokers strategically positioned to serve those areas. Most of our distributors
 retailers and brokers sell and distribute competing products
 including non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages
 and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses. The success of our distribution network will depend on the performance of the distributors
 retailers
 and brokers in our network. There is a risk they may not adequately perform their functions within the network by
 without limitation
 failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products in localities that may not be receptive to our product. Our ability to incentivize and motivate distributors to manage and sell our products is affected by competition from other beverage companies who have greater resources than we do. To the extent that our distributors
 retailers and brokers are distracted from selling our products or do not employ sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products
 including re-stocking the retail shelves with our products
 our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore
 such third parties&#8217; financial position or market share may deteriorate
 which could adversely affect our distribution
Our ability to maintain and expand our distribution network and attract additional distributors
 retailers and brokers will depend on a number of factors
our ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by distributors
We may not be able to successfully manage all or any of these factors in any of our current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. Our inability to achieve success with regards to any of these factors in a geographic distribution area will have a material adverse effect on our relationships in that particular geographic area
 thus limiting our ability to maintain or expand our market
We incur significant time and expense in attracting and maintaining key distributors
Our marketing and sales strategy depends in large part on the availability and performance of our independent distributors. We currently do not have
 nor do we anticipate in the future that we will be able to establish
 long-term contractual commitments from some of our distributors. We may not be able to maintain our current distribution relationships or establish and maintain successful relationships with distributors in new geographic distribution areas. Moreover
If we lose distributors or national or regional retail accounts
 our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. While we continually seek to expand and upgrade our distributor network and retail relationships
 we may not be able to maintain our distributor or retailer base. The loss of any of our distributors or retail accounts could have adverse effects on our revenues
 liquidity and financial results
 could negatively impact our ability to retain our relationships with our other distributors and our ability to expand our market
We rely on suppliers
 manufacturers and contractors
The Company intends to maintain a full supply chain for the provision of its hemp-based beverage products. Due to the novel and variable regulatory landscape for hemp and CBD production in the United States
 the Company&#8217;s third-party hemp and beverage suppliers
 manufacturers and contractors may elect
 at any time
 to decline or withdraw services necessary for the Company&#8217;s operations. Loss of these suppliers
 manufacturers and contractors
 including for non-hemp-based ingredients in the Company&#8217;s beverage products
 may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business
 financial condition
In addition
 any significant interruption
 negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain or increase in the prices for the ingredients in the Company&#8217;s products provided by any such third-party suppliers
 manufacturers and contractors could materially impact the Company&#8217;s business
 financial condition
 results of operations and prospects. Any inability to secure required supplies or to do so on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business
 financial condition
The beverage industry is margin-based with gross profits typically dependent on the excess of sales prices over costs. Consequently
 profitability is sensitive to fluctuations in wholesale and retail prices caused by changes in supply (which itself depends on other factors such as weather
 fuel
 equipment and labor costs
 shipping costs
 economic situation and demand)
 taxes
 government programs and policies for the beverage and hemp industries (including price controls and wholesale price restrictions that may be imposed by government agencies responsible for the regulation of sweetened beverages and hemp)
 and other market conditions
 all of which are factors beyond the control of the Company. The Company&#8217;s operating income will be sensitive to changes in the price of hemp and other beverage ingredients
 and the overall condition of the beverage and hemp industries
 as the Company&#8217;s profitability is directly related to the price of hemp and our other beverage ingredients. There is currently not an established market price for hemp
 and the price of hemp is affected by numerous factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Ingredient price volatility may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business
 financial condition
To date
 there is limited standardization in the research of the effects of hemp and hemp-based CBD
 and future clinical research studies may lead to conclusions that dispute or conflict with the Company&#8217;s understanding and belief regarding the medical benefits
 viability
 safety
 efficacy
 dosing and social acceptance of hemp and hemp-based CBD. Research in the United States and internationally regarding the medical benefits
 viability
 safety
Future research and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions to statements in this prospectus or could reach different or negative conclusions regarding the medical benefits
 viability
 safety
 efficacy
 dosing or other facts and perceptions related to hemp and CBD
There is no assurance that the Company will not incur uninsured liabilities and losses as a result of the conduct of its business. While the Company currently has some liability insurance coverage
 once capital is available to purchase additional liability insurance
 the Company plans to increase its comprehensive liability insurance. The Company also intends to evaluate the availability and cost of property casualty and business interruption insurance
 neither of which the Company currently has. Should uninsured losses occur
The sale of beverage products to consumers involves a certain level of risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity. Because consumption of the Company&#8217;s beverage products could cause injury to consumers if packaging or ingredients are defective
 we are subject to a risk of claims for such injuries and damages. We could also be named as co-parties in product liability suits that are brought against manufacturing partners that produce our beverage products
 packaging for those products
In addition
 our customers and partners may bring suits against us alleging damages for the failure of our products to meet stated specifications or other requirements. Any such suits
 even if not successful
 could be costly
 disrupt the attention of our management and damage our negotiations with distributors and/or customers. Any attempt by us to limit our product liability in our contracts may not be enforceable or may be subject to exceptions. While we do have product liability insurance
 our amounts of coverage may be inadequate to cover all potential liability claims. Insurance coverage
 particularly as it relates to products relating to the hemp industry
 is expensive
 and additional coverage may be difficult to obtain. Also
 additional insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms and may not be sufficient to cover potential claims. We cannot be sure that our contract manufacturers or manufacturing partners who produce our beverage products
 packaging and ingredients will have adequate insurance coverage themselves to cover against potential claims. If we experience a large insured loss
 it may exceed any insurance coverage limits we have at that time
 or our insurance carrier may decline to cover us or may raise our insurance rates to unacceptable levels
If we encounter product recalls or other product quality issues
Product quality issues
 real or imagined
 or allegations of product contamination
 even when false or unfounded
 could tarnish our image and could cause consumers to choose other products. In addition
 because of changing government regulations or implementation thereof
 or allegations of product contamination
Our independent distributors and national accounts are not generally required to place minimum monthly orders for our products. In order to reduce their inventory costs
 independent distributors typically order products from us on a &#8220;just in time&#8221; basis in quantities and at such times based on the demand for the products in a particular distribution area. Accordingly
 we cannot predict the timing or quantity of purchases by any of our independent distributors or whether any of our distributors will continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they may have done in the past. Additionally
 our larger distributors and regional partners may make orders that are larger than we have historically been required to fill. Shortages in inventory levels
If we do not adequately manage our inventory levels
We need to maintain adequate inventory levels to be able to deliver products to distributors on a timely basis. Our inventory supply depends on our ability to correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise
 particularly for new products
 seasonal promotions and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to maintain sufficient inventory of raw materials
 we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If we overestimate distributor or retailer demand for our products
 we may end up with too much inventory
 resulting in higher storage costs
 increased trade spend and the risk of inventory spoilage. If we fail to manage our inventory to meet demand
 we could damage our relationships with our distributors and retailers and could delay or lose sales opportunities
 which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. In addition
 if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and retailers is too high
 they will not place orders for additional products
If we fail to maintain relationships with our independent contract manufacturers
We do not manufacture our products but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and independent contract manufacturers (co-packers). We do not own the manufacturing facilities
 or the equipment required to manufacture and package our beverage products
 and we do not anticipate bringing the manufacturing process in-house in the future. Our ability to maintain effective relationships with contract manufacturers and other third parties for the production and delivery of our beverage products in a particular geographic distribution area is important to the success of our operations within each distribution area. Competition for contract manufacturers&#8217; business is intense
 especially in the United States
 and this could make it more difficult for us to obtain new or replacement manufacturers
 or to locate back-up manufacturers
 in our various distribution areas
 and could also affect the economic terms of our agreements with our existing manufacturers. We may not be able to maintain our relationships with current contract manufacturers or establish satisfactory relationships with new or replacement contract manufacturers
 whether in existing or new geographic distribution areas. The failure to establish and maintain effective relationships with contract manufacturers for a distribution area could increase our manufacturing costs and thereby materially reduce gross profits from the sale of our products in that area. Poor relations with any of our contract manufacturers could adversely affect the amount and timing of product delivered to our distributors for resale
 which would in turn adversely affect our revenues and financial condition. In addition
 our agreements with our contract manufacturers are terminable at any time
We are expected to arrange for our contract manufacturing needs sufficiently in advance of anticipated requirements
 which is customary in the contract manufacturing industry for comparably sized companies. Based on the cost structure and forecasted demand for the particular geographic area where our contract manufacturers are located
 we must evaluate which of contract manufacturers to use. To the extent demand for our products exceeds available inventory or the production capacity of our contract manufacturing arrangements
 or orders are not submitted on a timely basis
 we will be unable to fulfill distributor orders on demand. Conversely
 we may produce more product inventory than warranted by the actual demand for it
 resulting in higher storage costs and the potential risk of inventory spoilage. Our failure to accurately predict and manage our contract manufacturing requirements and our inventory levels may impair relationships with our independent distributors and key accounts
 which
 in turn
The principal raw materials we use or supply to our contract manufacturers include plastic bottles and lids
 aluminum cans
 labels and cardboard cartons
 aluminum closures
 hemp
 and other beverage ingredients. In addition
 certain of our contract manufacturing arrangements allow such contract manufacturers to increase their charges to us based on their own cost increases. These manufacturing and ingredient costs are subject to fluctuation. Substantial increases in the prices of ingredients
 raw materials and packaging materials
 used to produce our products
 to the extent that they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products
 would increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability. If the supply of these raw materials is impaired or if prices increase significantly
If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including glass
 sugar
 and other key supplies
 we might not be able to satisfy demand for our beverage products on a short-term basis. Moreover
 in the past there have been industry-wide shortages of concentrates
 supplements and sweeteners
 and these shortages could occur again from time to time in the future
In addition
 suppliers could fail to provide ingredients or raw materials on a timely basis
 or fail to meet our performance expectations
 for a number of reasons
 including
 for example
 disruption to the global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak
 which could cause a serious disruption to our business
 increase our costs
 decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business
Over the past few years
 volatility in the global oil markets has resulted in high fuel prices
 which many shipping companies have passed on to their customers by way of higher base pricing and increased fuel surcharges. If fuel prices increase
 we expect to experience higher shipping rates and fuel surcharges
 as well as energy surcharges on our raw materials. It is hard to predict what will happen in the fuel markets in 2021 and beyond. Due to the price sensitivity of our products
Disruption within our supply chain
 contract manufacturing or distribution channels could have an adverse effect on our business
Our ability
 through our suppliers
 business partners
 contract manufacturers
 independent distributors
 and retailers
 to make
 move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our suppliers or to manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather
 natural disaster
 fire or explosion
 terrorism
 pandemics such as influenza and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
 labor strikes or other reasons
 could impair the manufacture
 distribution and sale of our products. Many of these events are outside of our control. Failure to take adequate steps to protect against or mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events
 or to effectively manage such events if they occur
 could adversely affect our business
If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel
 our efficiency and operations would be adversely affected; in addition
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees in such areas as finance
 sales
 marketing and product development and distribution. We compete to hire new employees
 and
 in some cases
 must train them and develop their skills and competencies. We may not be able to provide our employees with competitive salaries
 and our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees
Recently
 we have experienced significant changes in our sales personnel
 and more could occur in the future. Changes to operations
 policies and procedures
 which can often occur with the appointment of new personnel
 can create uncertainty
 may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively
 and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition
 transition periods are often difficult as the new Company personnel gain detailed knowledge of our operations
 and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style. Employee turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge
 which can negatively affect strategy and execution. Until we integrate new personnel
 and unless they are able to succeed in their positions
 we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business
Further
 to the extent we experience additional personnel turnover
 our operations
 financial condition
 and employee morale could be negatively impacted. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management and sales personnel
 our business could suffer. Moreover
Chief Executive Officer
 our operations could be disrupted
Our business plan relies significantly on the continued services of William Alessi
 who we hired as our Chief Executive Officer in February 2018. If we were to lose the services of Mr. Alessi
The relationship of management to the Company could create conflicts of interest. While management has a fiduciary duty to the Company
The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we will indemnify its officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law
 provided that the officer or director acted in bad faith or breached his or her duty to us or our stockholders
 that the officer or director acted in bad faith
 or that it is more likely than not that it will ultimately be determined that the officer or director has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible for under Nevada law for the Company to indemnify the officer or director. If we were called upon to indemnify an officer or director
If we fail to protect our trademarks and trade secrets
We rely on a combination of trademark and trade secrecy laws
 confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our brand and our reputation
 and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further
 enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights
 including our trademarks and trade secrets
 could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We regard our intellectual property
 particularly our trademarks and trade secrets
 as crucial to our business and our success. However
 the steps taken by us to protect these proprietary rights may not be adequate and may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks
 trade secrets or similar proprietary rights. In addition
 other parties may seek to assert infringement claims against us
 and we may have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. Any such claim or litigation could be costly. In addition
 any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market or sell our brands
 profitably exploit our products
The production
 marketing and sale of our beverages
 including contents
 labels
 caps and containers
 are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal
 provincial
 state and local health agencies. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production batch or &#8220;run&#8221; is not in compliance with any of these regulations
 we may be fined
 or production may be stopped
 which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly
 any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore
 the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area
 we cannot anticipate whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements
 whether labeling
 environmental
 tax or otherwise
Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the chemical content or perceived adverse health consequences of our beverage products. These types of requirements
 if they become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations
 may inhibit sales of such products. In California
 a law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. If a component found in one of our products is added to the list
 or if the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that may become available under this law and related regulations as they currently exist
 or as they may be amended
 results in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in one of our beverages produced for sale in California
We may become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings. Litigation involves significant risks
 uncertainties
 and costs
 including distraction of management attention away from our business operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate
 if possible
 the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates
 we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings
 as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations
 including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. Nonetheless
 our policies and procedures may not ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties
 including substantial monetary fines
There is growing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures may cause an adverse change in weather patterns around the globe resulting in an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products
 changing weather patterns could have a negative impact on agricultural productivity
 which may limit availability or increase the cost of certain key ingredients such as sugar cane
 natural flavors and supplements used in our products. Also
 increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities
 the operation of our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition
 the increasing concern over climate change may result in more regional
 federal
 and global legal and regulatory requirements and could result in increased production
 transportation
 and raw material costs. As a result
The proper functioning of our own information technology (IT) infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. We may not have the necessary financial resources to update and maintain our IT infrastructure
 and any failure or interruption of our IT system could adversely impact our operations. In addition
 our IT is vulnerable to cyberattacks
 computer viruses
 worms and other malicious software programs
 physical and electronic break-ins
 sabotage
 and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these IT-related and other potential disruptions. However
 given the unpredictability of the timing
 nature and scope of any such IT failures or disruptions
 we could potentially be subject to downtimes
 transactional errors
 processing inefficiencies
 operational delays
 other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products to our customers
 the compromising of confidential or personal information
 destruction or corruption of data
 security breaches
 other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks
 financial losses from remedial actions
 loss of business or potential liability
 and/or damage to our reputation
 any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows
 competitive position
Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter for many reasons
Our sales are seasonal
 and we experience fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of many factors. We historically have generated a greater percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year
 and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. As a result
In addition
 our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of other factors including
Our ability to maintain
 develop and expand distribution channels for current and new products
 develop favorable arrangements with third party distributors of our products and minimize or reduce issues associated with engaging new distributors and retailers
 including
 but not limited to
Unilateral decisions by distributors
 grocery store chains
 specialty chain stores
 club stores
Our ability to manage our resources to sufficiently support general operating activities
 promotion allowances and slotting fees
 promotion and selling activities
 and capital expansion
Our ability to meet the competitive response by much larger
 well-funded and established companies currently operating in the beverage industry
 as we introduce new competitive products
Due to these and other factors
 our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to do so in the future
increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes
changes in availability of tax credits
 tax holidays
In December 2017
 enacted legislation in the United States significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code. The enacted federal income tax law
 among other things
 contained significant changes to corporate taxation
 including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21% beginning in 2018
 limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings
 limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks
 one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated
 immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time
Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate
 the overall impact of the new federal tax law remains uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition
Global economic
 political
 social and other conditions
 including the COVID-19 pandemic
The beverage industry
 and particularly those companies selling premium beverages like us
 can be affected by macro-economic factors
 including changes in national
 regional
 and local economic conditions
 unemployment levels and consumer spending patterns
 which together may impact the willingness of consumers to purchase our products as they adjust their discretionary spending. Adverse economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors to obtain the credit necessary to fund their working capital needs
 which could negatively impact their ability or desire to continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they have done in the past. If we experience similar adverse economic conditions in the future
 sales of our products could be adversely affected
 collectability of accounts receivable may be compromised and we may face obsolescence issues with our inventory
Additionally
 while the extent of the impact on our business and financial condition is unknown at this time
 we may be negatively affected by COVID-19 and actions taken to address and limit the spread of COVID-19
 such as travel restrictions
 event cancellations
 and limitations affecting the supply of labor and the movement of raw materials and finished products. If available manufacturing capacity is reduced as a result of the COVID-19
 it could negatively affect the timely supply
 pricing and availability of finished products. Moreover
 we will also be negatively impacted by current and future closures of restaurants
 independent accounts
 convenience chains
 and retail store chains resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. The current closures of restaurants and independent accounts will negatively affect our revenues and cash flows
 especially with respect to our fountain business
 which comprised approximately 9% of the Company&#8217;s revenues in 2019. Although the current status of retail and convenience chains remains unknown at this time
Overall
 the Company does not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on its business
 financing activities
 or the global economy as a whole. However
 these effects could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s liquidity
 capital resources
Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions
The United States generally accepted accounting principles and related pronouncements
 implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide variety of matters that are relevant to our business
 such as
 but not limited to
 stock-based compensation
 trade spend and promotions
 and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions
 estimates and judgments by our management. Changes to these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions
If we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting
We are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective. Because of their inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting
 however well designed and operated
 can only provide reasonable
 and not absolute
 assurance that the controls will prevent or detect misstatements. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems
 there is only the reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions. The failure of controls by design deficiencies or absence of adequate controls could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results
The price of our common stock may be volatile
There has been significant volatility in the volume and market price of our common stock
 and this volatility may continue in the future. In addition
 factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results
 litigation involving us
 general trends relating to the beverage industry
 actions by governmental agencies
 national economic and stock market considerations as well as other events and circumstances beyond our control
 including the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak
A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. If we are unable to raise the funds required for all of our planned operations and key initiatives
 we may be forced to allocate funds from other planned uses
 which may negatively impact our business and operations
From time to time
 we may issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities. The issuance of these securities could dilute our shareholders&#8217; ownership in our company and may include terms that give new investors rights that are superior to those of our current shareholders. Moreover
 any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on our shareholders&#8217; ownership interest
Our common stock is traded on the OTC Link ATS
Our stock is traded on the OTC Link Alternative Trading System (ATS) operated by OTC Markets Group
 Inc. The OTC Link ATS is a significantly more limited market than the national securities exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange
 or Nasdaq stock exchange
or qualitative standards that a company must meet to have its stock quoted on the OTC Link ATS. The OTC Link ATS is an inter-dealer quotation system much less regulated than the major exchanges
 and trading in our common stock may be subject to abuses
 volatility and shorting
 which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) has adopted rules that require a broker-dealer to have reasonable grounds for believing an investment is suitable for that customer when recommending an investment to a customer. FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for some customers and may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock
 which may result in a limited ability to buy and sell our stock. We currently do not meet applicable listing standards of a market senior to the OTC Link ATS
Our common shares are subject to the &#8220;Penny Stock&#8221; rules of the SEC
 and the trading market in our securities will likely be limited
The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a &#8220;penny stock
&#8221; for the purposes relevant to us
 as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
The broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction
In order to approve a person&#8217;s account for transactions in penny stocks

We do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future
We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid
 and if dividends are paid
 there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends
As of December 31
 2020
 the Company&#8217;s executive officers and directors owned approximately 64.8% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock. By virtue of such stock ownership
 the principal shareholders are able to control the election of the members of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and to generally exercise control over the affairs of the Company. Such concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying

Even if a market develops for our shares
 our shares may be thinly traded with wide share price fluctuations
If an established market for our shares develops
 our share price may be volatile with wide fluctuations in response to several factors
 including: potential investors&#8217; anticipated feeling regarding our results of operations; increased competition; and our ability or inability to generate future revenues. In addition
 our share price may be affected by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. Our share price might be affected by general economic
 political
 and market conditions
 such as recessions
 interest rates
 commodity prices
 or international currency fluctuations. Additionally
 stocks traded on the OTC Link ATS are usually thinly traded
 highly volatile and not followed by analysts. These factors

Each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock is convertible into 1.667 shares of Company common stock (subject to a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation). The Series B-1 Preferred Stock entitles the holder to piggy-back registration rights and one vote per share and has no liquidation or dividend preferences. Also
 on July 21
 2020
 we filed with the State of Nevada a Certificate of Designation designating 750
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s authorized preferred stock as Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series B-2 Preferred Stock&#8221;). Each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock is convertible into a number of shares of Company common stock equal to $1.00 divided by (i) the lesser of $0.60 or 60% of the 14-day average closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock at the time of conversion (the &#8220;Market Price&#8221;) if the conversion occurs within 6 months of July 21
 2020
 or (ii) 60% of the Market Price if the conversion occurs at least six months after July 21
 2020 (subject to a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation). The Series B-2 Preferred Stock entitles the holder to one vote per share and has no liquidation or dividend preferences or other rights. No shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock are outstanding although we have granted Todd Braun
 one of the Selling Security Holders
 warrants to purchase all 750
000 designated but unissued shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock. We have not designated any other series of preferred stock
 but our Board of Directors has the authority to designate the rights and preferences of each series of preferred stock without action by our stockholders
 and then to issue shares of preferred stock. As a result
 preferred shares could be issued quickly and easily
 negatively affecting the rights of holders of common shares and could be issued with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal of management more difficult. Because we may issue preferred stock in order to raise capital for our operations
As of December 31
 2020
 the Company had 22
263
829 outstanding shares of common stock which were owned by approximately 32 shareholders of record

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the amortization period for intangible assets
 valuation and impairment valuation of intangible assets
 depreciable lives of the web site and property and equipment
 valuation of warrant and beneficial conversion feature debt discounts
 The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 360-10
 &#8220;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.&#8221; This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired
 The Company measures their financial assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For certain of our financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts payable
We have adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations
 financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value
 provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements
 but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques
 such as the market approach (comparable market prices)
 the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow)
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (&#8220;ASU 2014-09&#8221;)

ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019

 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.&nbsp; As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.&nbsp; Accordingly
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks.&nbsp; Such procedures included examining

DECEMBER 31
Good Hemp
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Good Hemp&#8221;)
 formerly known as Keyser Resources
 Inc.
 and Lone Star Gold
 Inc.
 was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 26
The Company was involved in the exploration and development of mining properties until September 30
 2013
 when it discontinued operations. In 2017
 the Company was put into receivership and in 2018
 it emerged from receivership. On September 11
 2019
 the Company's Board of Directors
 pursuant to Nevada Revised Statute 92A.280
 amended the Company's Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company from Lone Star Gold
 Inc. to Good Hemp
 Inc. The amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on September 12
The Company is now a North Carolina based company that is made up of industry veterans focused on exploiting niche markets in the hemp industry. Good Hemp&#174; includes two lines of hemp-based beverages. Good Hemp&#174; 2oh! is a hemp-derived
 CBD-infused line of flavored waters
 and Good Hemp&#174; fizz! is a line of carbonated hemp oil infused sodas. Good Hemp&#174; products have been sold throughout the United States since 2016 via Amazon.com
By establishing a comprehensive distribution system
Effective July 1
 2020
 the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) of the Company appointed Scott Shellady to serve as the Chief Strategic Officer of the Company. In connection with Mr. Shellady&#8217;s appointment
 on or about June 24
 2020 (with an effective date of July 1
 2020)
 the Company entered into a consulting services agreement with Mr. Shellady
 pursuant to which Mr. Shellady would (i) render marketing
 sales
 distribution
 and branding services to the Company; and (ii) would be paid $5
000 per month and 100
000 shares of Company common stock for services rendered during the initial term from July 1
 2020
 through December 31
On July 21
 2020
 the Company filed with the State of Nevada a Certificate of Designation designating 250
Also
 on July 21
 2020
 the Company filed with the State of Nevada a Certificate of Designation designating 750
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s authorized preferred stock as Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series B-2 Preferred Stock&#8221;). Each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock is convertible into a number of shares of Company common stock equal to $1.00 divided by (i) the lesser of $0.60 or 60% of the 14-day average closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock at the time of conversion (the &#8220;Market Price&#8221;) if the conversion occurs within 6 months of July 21
 2020
 or (ii) 60% of the Market Price if the conversion occurs at least 6 months after July 21
The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in increased travel restrictions
 and shutdown of businesses
 which may cause slower recovery of the economy. We may experience impact from quarantines
 market downturns and changes in customer behavior related to pandemic fears and impact on our workforce if the virus continues to spread. In addition
 one or more of our customers
 partners
 service providers or suppliers may experience financial distress
 delayed or defaults on payment
 file for bankruptcy protection
 sharp diminishing of business
 or suffer disruptions in their business due to the outbreak. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments and reactions throughout the world
 which are highly uncertain and will include emerging information concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to attempt to contain the coronavirus. It is likely to result in a potential material adverse impact on our business
 results of operations and financial condition. Wider-spread COVID-19 globally could prolong the deterioration in economic conditions and could cause decreases in or delays in advertising spending and reduce and/or negatively impact our short-term ability to grow our revenues. Any decreased collectability of accounts receivable

Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices
 establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company&#8217;s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure
 among other items
 that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
The FASB issued ASC 820-10
 
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices
 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active
For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 cash equivalents include demand deposits
 money market funds
The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times
 its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company&#8217;s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds

 financial statement disclosure
 or auditing scope or procedure
 which disagreement(s)
 if not resolved to Thayer O'Neal's satisfaction
On November 7
 2019
 the Company engaged Boyle CPA

 and the subsequent interim period through the date of engagement
 neither we
 nor anyone engaged on our behalf
 consulted with Boyle CPA
 LLC regarding either the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction
 either completed or proposed
During the fiscal year ended December 31
 2019
 there have been no disagreements with the Former Accounting Firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices
 financial statement disclosure
 or auditing scope or procedure
Under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer&#8217;s management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of December 31
 2020 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by
 or under the supervision of the CEO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records which in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting
In evaluating the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2020
 management used the criteria established in the Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;). Based on the criteria established by COSO
 management (with the participation of the CEO and CFO) identified the following material weaknesses in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2020
The Company lacked effective controls for ensuring the accuracy of reporting over significant account balances
 including the review
 approval
As a result of these material weaknesses
 management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2020
The Company&#8217;s management
 including the CEO and acting CFO
 does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the control system&#8217;s objectives will be met. Further
 the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more people
 or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time
Except as set forth above
 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect

 Inc. (the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Good Hemp&amp;#8221;)
 formerly known as Keyser Resources
 Inc.
 and Lone Star Gold
 Inc.
 was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 26
 2007.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;The Company was involved in the exploration and development of mining properties until September 30
 2013
 when it discontinued operations. In 2017
 the Company was put into receivership and in 2018
 it emerged from receivership. On September 11
 2019
 the Company's Board of Directors
 pursuant to Nevada Revised Statute 92A.280
 amended the Company's Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company from Lone Star Gold
 Inc. to Good Hemp
 Inc. The amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on September 12
 2019.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;The Company is now a North Carolina based company that is made up of industry veterans focused on exploiting niche markets in the hemp industry. Good Hemp&amp;#174; includes two lines of hemp-based beverages. Good Hemp&amp;#174; 2oh! is a hemp-derived
 CBD-infused line of flavored waters
 and Good Hemp&amp;#174; fizz! is a line of carbonated hemp oil infused sodas. Good Hemp&amp;#174; products have been sold throughout the United States since 2016 via Amazon.com
 as well as local retailers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;By establishing a comprehensive distribution system
 Good Hemp&amp;#174; has secured listings for its products with regional and national grocery and convenience chain stores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;Effective July 1
 2020
 the Board of Directors (the &amp;#8220;Board&amp;#8221;) of the Company appointed Scott Shellady to serve as the Chief Strategic Officer of the Company. In connection with Mr. Shellady&amp;#8217;s appointment
 on or about June 24
 2020 (with an effective date of July 1
 2020)
 the Company entered into a consulting services agreement with Mr. Shellady
 pursuant to which Mr. Shellady would (i) render marketing
 sales
 distribution
 and branding services to the Company; and (ii) would be paid $5
000 per month and 100
000 shares of Company common stock for services rendered during the initial term from July 1
 2020
 through December 31
 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;On July 21
 2020
 the Company filed with the State of Nevada a Certificate of Designation designating 250
000 shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s authorized preferred stock as Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the &amp;#8220;Series B-1 Preferred Stock&amp;#8221;). Each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock is convertible into 1.667 shares of Company common stock (subject to a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation). The Series B-1 Preferred Stock entitles the holder to piggy-back registration rights and one vote per share.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;Also
 on July 21
 2020
 the Company filed with the State of Nevada a Certificate of Designation designating 750
000 shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s authorized preferred stock as Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the &amp;#8220;Series B-2 Preferred Stock&amp;#8221;). Each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock is convertible into a number of shares of Company common stock equal to $1.00 divided by (i) the lesser of $0.60 or 60% of the 14-day average closing price of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock at the time of conversion (the &amp;#8220;Market Price&amp;#8221;) if the conversion occurs within 6 months of July 21
 2020
 or (ii) 60% of the Market Price if the conversion occurs at least 6 months after July 21
 2020 (subject to a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation). The Series B-2 Preferred Stock entitles the holder to one vote per share.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in increased travel restrictions

 among other items
 that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition

The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts

Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fair Value of Financial Instruments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;The FASB issued ASC 820-10
 &lt;em&gt;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&lt;/em&gt;
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
 where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table style=border-spacing:0;font-size:10pt;width:100% cellpadding=0&gt; &lt;tr style=height:15px&gt; &lt;td style=width:4%;vertical-align:top;&gt; &lt;p style=MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=vertical-align:top;&gt; &lt;p style=MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr style=height:15px&gt; &lt;td style=vertical-align:top;&gt; &lt;p style=MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=vertical-align:top;&gt; &lt;p style=MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices

 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date
 with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments
 the Company used a Black Scholes valuation model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments
 including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity
 is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commitment and Contingencies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;The Company follows ASC 450-20

Under the provisions of the Earnings per Share Topic ASC
 basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however
 potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Income Taxes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes
 which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that would otherwise be recorded for income tax benefits primarily relating to operating loss carryforwards as realization cannot be determined to be more likely than not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;The statement establishes a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements. Also
 the statement implements a process for measuring those tax positions which meet the recognition threshold of being ultimately sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. There are no uncertain tax positions taken by the Company on its tax returns and the adoption of the statement had no material impact to the Company&amp;#8217;s financial statements. The Company files tax returns in the US and states in which it has operations and is subject to taxation. Tax years subsequent to 2013 remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revenue Recognition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606. The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (iii) determine the transaction price
 (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
 and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606
 including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception
 once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue
 the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of our performance obligations or expiration of the contractual time to use services such as professional service hours purchased in bulk for a given time period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;&gt;In June 2018

 and determined that the instrument should be classified as a liability since the conversion option becomes effective at issuance resulting in there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options. The Company determined our derivative liabilities to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value as of September 30
 2020. The Black-Scholes model requires six basic data inputs: the exercise or strike price
 time to expiration
 the risk-free interest rate
 the current stock price
 the estimated volatility of the stock price in the future
 and the dividend rate. Changes to these inputs could produce a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The fair value of each convertible note is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;text-align:justify;margin:0px&gt;For the year ended December 31

 &lt;em&gt;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&lt;/em&gt;
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
 where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table style=border-spacing:0;font-size:10pt;width:100% cellpadding=0&gt; &lt;tr style=height:15px&gt; &lt;td style=width:4%;vertical-align:top;&gt; &lt;p style=margin:0px&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=width:92%;vertical-align:top;&gt; &lt;p style=margin:0px&gt;Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr style=height:15px&gt; &lt;td style=width:4%;vertical-align:top;&gt; &lt;p style=margin:0px&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=width:92%;vertical-align:top;&gt; &lt;p style=margin:0px&gt;Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices

 basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however


 which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that would otherwise be recorded for income tax benefits primarily relating to operating loss carryforwards as realization cannot be determined to be more likely than not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;margin:0px&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=font-size:10pt;font-family:times new roman;margin:0px&gt;The statement establishes a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements.

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued ASU No. 2018-07
 Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting
 which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees except for certain circumstances. Any transition impact will be a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15

 that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in increased travel restrictions
 and shutdown of businesses
 which may cause slower recovery of the economy. We may experience impact from quarantines
 market downturns and changes in customer behavior related to pandemic fears and impact on our workforce if the virus continues to spread. In addition
 one or more of our customers
 partners
 service providers or suppliers may experience financial distress
 delayed or defaults on payment
 file for bankruptcy protection
 sharp diminishing of business
 or suffer disruptions in their business due to the outbreak. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments and reactions throughout the world
 which are highly uncertain and will include emerging information concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to attempt to contain the coronavirus. It is likely to result in a potential material adverse impact on our business
 results of operations and financial condition. Wider-spread COVID-19 globally could prolong the deterioration in economic conditions and could cause decreases in or delays in advertising spending and reduce and/or negatively impact our short-term ability to grow our revenues. Any decreased collectability of accounts receivable
 bankruptcy of small and medium businesses
 or early termination of agreements due to deterioration in economic conditions could negatively impact our results of operations.

Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices
 establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company&#8217;s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure
 among other items
 that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented.




The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
 future results of operations will be affected.









The FASB issued ASC 820-10
 
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices
 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active
 or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.




For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 cash equivalents include demand deposits
 money market funds
The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times
 its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company&#8217;s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds
 and as such
 it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.




Inventory consisting of raw materials and finished product is stated at the lower of cost (first in
 first out method) or net realizable value.









The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times
 its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company&#8217;s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds
 and as such
 it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.




Trade accounts receivable consists of product sales to customers. Trade accounts receivable are generally due 30 days after issuance of the invoice. Receivables past due more than 120 days are considered delinquent. Delinquent receivables are written off based on specific circumstances of the customer. At December 31
 2020
 an allowance was not deemed necessary.




For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities
 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date
 with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments
 the Company used a Black Scholes valuation model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments
 including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity
 is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.




The Company follows ASC 450-20
 Loss Contingencies
 to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims
 assessments
 litigation
The Company follows ASC 440-10
 Commitments
 to report accounting for certain commitments.




The Company computes net income or loss per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Under the provisions of the Earnings per Share Topic ASC
 basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however
 potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive.




The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes
The statement establishes a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements. Also
 the statement implements a process for measuring those tax positions which meet the recognition threshold of being ultimately sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. There are no uncertain tax positions taken by the Company on its tax returns and the adoption of the statement had no material impact to the Company&#8217;s financial statements. The Company files tax returns in the US and states in which it has operations and is subject to taxation. Tax years subsequent to 2013 remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions.




Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606. The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (iii) determine the transaction price
 (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
 and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606
 including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception
 once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue
 the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.




In June 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU No. 2018-07
 Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting
 which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees except for certain circumstances. Any transition impact will be a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within that annual period and early adoption is permitted. We adopted this guidance on January 1
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which will require organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required
 and optional practical expedients may be elected. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within that annual period. Subsequent amendments to the initial guidance have been issued in January 2017
 January 2018
 and July 2018 within ASU No. 2017-03
 ASU No. 2018-01
 ASU No. 2018-10
 and ASU No. 2018-11 regarding qualitative disclosures
 optional practical expedients
 codification improvements and an optional transition method to adopt with a cumulative-effect adjustment versus a modified retrospective approach. These updates do not change the core principle of the guidance under ASU No. 2016-02
 but rather provide implementation guidance. We adopted this guidance on January 1
In June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13
 &#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&#8221;. The accounting standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those years
 beginning after December 15
In January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04
 &#8220;Intangibles and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment&#8221;
 which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill
 but rather requires an entity to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value over its fair value. This amendment is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15
In February 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02 (ASU No. 2018-02)
 &#8220;Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)&#8221;
 which amended the previous guidance to allow for certain tax effects &#8220;stranded&#8221; in accumulated other comprehensive income
 which are impacted by the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22
 2017
 to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into retained earnings. This amendment pertains only to those items impacted by the new tax law and does not apply to any future tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018 and allowed for early adoption. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-02 did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13
 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework &#8211; Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement
 which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurement by removing
 modifying
 and adding certain disclosures. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2019
In August 2018
 the SEC adopted amendments to simplify certain disclosure requirements
 as set forth in Securities Act Release No. 33-10532
 Disclosure Update and Simplification
 which includes a requirement for entities to present the changes in shareholders&#8217; equity in the interim financial statements in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. This amendment is effective for all filings made on or after November 5
 2018. In light of the timing of effectiveness of the amendment and proximity to the filing date for most filers&#8217; quarterly reports
In August 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2018-15
 &#8220;Intangibles&#8211;Goodwill and Other&#8211;Internal&#8211;Use Software (Topic 350): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.&#8221; ASU No. 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. ASU No. 2018-15 is effective for the Company on a prospective or retrospective basis beginning on January 1
