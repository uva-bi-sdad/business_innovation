The Simply Good Foods Company (&#8220;Simply Good Foods&#8221;) was formed on March 30
 2017
 to consummate a business combination (the &#8220;Business Combination&#8221;) between Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. (&#8220;Conyers Park&#8221;) and NCP-ATK Holdings
 Inc. (&#8220;Atkins&#8221;)
 which occurred on July 7
 2017 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;). As a result
Conyers Park
 a special purpose acquisition company
 was formed in 2016 for the purpose of effecting a merger

 asset acquisition
 stock purchase
Unless the context otherwise requires
 &#8220;we
&#8221; &#8220;us
&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer
 for periods prior to the completion of the Business Combination
 to Atkins and its subsidiaries
 and
 for periods upon or&#160;after the completion of the Business Combination
 to The Simply Good Foods Company and its subsidiaries. In context
The Simply Good Foods Company is a highly-focused consumer packaged food and beverage company that aims to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient
 innovative
 great-tasting
 better-for-you snacks and meal replacements. The product portfolio we develop
 market and sell consists primarily of nutrition bars
 ready-to-drink (&#8220;RTD&#8221;) shakes
 sweet and salty snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Atkins&#174;
The Company&#8217;s nutritious snacking platform consists of brands that specialize in providing products for consumers that follow certain nutritional philosophies and health-and-wellness trends: Atkins&#174; for those following a low-carb lifestyle and Quest&#174; for consumers seeking a variety of protein-rich foods and beverages that also limit sugars and simple carbs.&#160;We distribute our products in major retail channels
 primarily in North America
 including grocery
 club and mass merchandise
 as well as through e-commerce
 convenience
 specialty and other channels. Our portfolio of nutritious snacking brands gives us a strong platform with which to introduce new products
 expand distribution
We believe snacking occasions have been on the rise in recent years as consumers desire more convenient
 healthy and delicious foods
 snacks and meal replacements. We believe our emphasis on product formats such as our nutrition and protein bars
 cookies and RTD shakes positions us to fill important needs for consumers. We believe a number of existing and emerging consumer trends within the U.S. food and beverage industry will continue to both drive the growth of the nutritional snacking category and increase the demand for our product offerings. Some of these trends include increased consumption of smaller
 more frequent meals throughout the day
 consumers&#8217; strong preference for convenient
 &#8220;better-for-you&#8221; snacks
 consumers&#8217; greater focus on health and wellness
 and consumers&#8217; moves toward limiting carbohydrate and sugar consumption
With our Atkins brand
 we strive to offer a compelling line of nutrition bars
 RTD shakes and confections
 and with our Quest brand
 we strive to offer an attractive line up of protein bars
 cookies
 pizza
 protein chips
 RTD shakes and confections
 which target these existing and emerging consumer trends. Our sales
 marketing and research and development capabilities enable us to distribute products to a national customer base across a spectrum of retail channels
 including the mass merchandise
 grocery and drug channels
 club stores
 e-commerce
Simply Good Foods was formed in Delaware on March 30
 2017
 to consummate the Business Combination
 which occurred on July 7
 2017. As part of our strategy to become an industry leading snacking platform
 in November 2019
 we acquired Quest Nutrition
In addition to pursuing attractive run-rate cost synergies over time by leveraging efficiencies of scale with our legacy Atkins business
 we completed the Quest Acquisition to realize several other potential benefits. Quest's products compete in many attractive
 fast growing sub-segments within the nutritional snacking category and we expect Quest&#8217;s research and development insights and capabilities to benefit our broader business. Quest also has an extremely loyal following and strong appeal among consumers ages 18-35
 which complements Atkins' strength among consumers ages 35+. We also believe the Quest Acquisition will allow us to benefit from Quest's existing relationships and effectiveness within certain channels of trade
 such as e-commerce and the small format channel
 and leverage Quest&#8217;s social media-based marketing capabilities. We believe we will also benefit from utilizing certain of Quest&#8217;s systems
 such as its enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform

In December 2019
 a novel coronavirus disease
 or COVID-19
 was reported and in January 2020
 the World Health Organization
 or WHO
 declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28
 2020
 the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries
 and on March 11
 2020
 the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. On March 27
 2020
 the Coronavirus Aid
 Relief
of the COVID-19 pandemic
 including tax relief and government loans
 grants and investments. Additionally
 various federal
 state and local government-imposed movement restrictions and initiatives have been implemented to reduce the global transmission of COVID-19
 including reduced or eliminated food services
 the closure of retailing establishments
During the third quarter of 2020
 we actively engaged with the various elements of our value chain
 including our customers
 contract manufacturers
 and logistics and transportation providers
 to meet demand for our products and to remain informed of any challenges within our value chain. Given the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the initial surge in consumption
 we increased finished goods inventory of some of our key products. Based on information available to us as of the end of our fiscal year
 we believe we will be able to deliver our products to meet customer orders on a timely basis
 and therefore
 we expect our products will continue to be available for purchase to meet consumer meal replacement and snacking needs for the foreseeable future. We continue to monitor customer and consumer demand
We implemented remote work arrangements and restricted business travel in mid-March
 and to date
 these arrangements have not materially affected our ability to maintain our business operations
 including the operation of financial reporting systems
 internal control over financial reporting
 and disclosure controls and procedures. As describe in more detail below under &#8220;Our Strengths
&#8221; we believe our lean infrastructure
 which allows for significant flexibility
 speed-to-market and minimal capital investment
As described in more detail under the caption &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
&#8221; our consolidated results of operations for the full fiscal year ended August 29
 2020 were affected by changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior due to COVID-19. After the brief pantry loading period in mid-March 2020
 the nutritional snacking category saw a marked decrease in shopping trips (particularly in the mass channel) and fewer usage occasions. This affected our portable and convenient on-the-go products
 especially the nutrition and protein bar portion of our business for both our Atkins and Quest brands. As home confinement restrictions began to ease
During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020
 the improvement in category trends plateaued. While our Quest brand has outperformed its portion of the nutritious snaking segment
 the performance of our Atkins brand
 which is part of the weight management portion of the market
 has remained slower due to the temporary softer interest in weight management for consumers
We believe the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain and such uncertainty will likely continue during our 2021 fiscal year. We also believe demand for our products has strengthened
 but there will likely continue to be irregularity in third party reported retail takeaway data for our products until the more fulsome reopening of the U.S. economy and the associated return of shopping behavior to more normal patterns and our brand benefits of active nutrition and weight management drive more better-for-you snacking and meal replacement usage occasions. Please also see the information under Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for additional information regarding the risks of pandemics
Effective September&#160;24
 2020
 we sold the assets exclusively related to the Company&#8217;s SimplyProtein&#174; brand of products to a newly formed entity led by the Company&#8217;s Canadian-based management team who had been responsible for this brand prior to the sale transaction. In addition to purchasing these assets
. We are a leader in the fast growing nutritional snacking category
 and both the Atkins and Quest brands are leading brands with scale in nutrition and protein bars for both brands
 RTD shakes and confections for the Atkins brand
 and chips
 cookies and pizza for the Quest brand. Our highly focused snacking portfolio provides us with a leading position within retailers&#8217; nutrition and wellness aisles
 resulting in meaningful shelf space. Our brands are able to appeal to both consumers interested in an active lifestyle who are seeking protein rich
 low-carb snacking options and weight management program consumers
Increasing global concern about growing rates of obesity and weight-related diseases and other health issues has resulted in increased scientific
 media and consumer focus on nutrition. Over 100 independent
 peer reviewed
 clinical studies show the benefits of controlling carbohydrates. Management believes that this focus is prompting consumers to rebalance their nutritional breakdown away from carbohydrates. In fact
 73% of consumers are seeking to lower their carbohydrate intake according to Health Focus International. Our brand attributes
 &#8220;low carb
&#8221; &#8220;low sugar&#8221; and &#8220;protein rich&#8221; nutrition
 are well aligned with consumer mega trends. In addition
 we believe consumers&#8217; eating habits are gradually shifting towards increased convenience
 snacking and meal replacement. We also believe our portfolio of convenient and nutritious products and our ongoing effort to meet consumer demands for &#8220;cleaner labels
&#8221; which we define as products made with fewer
 simpler and more recognizable ingredients
 We have been able to grow our product offerings for both of our nutritious snacking brands through our line extensions and through acquisitions. Our in-house product development experience
 combined with our outsourced manufacturing model
 allow us to bring new products to market quickly. We pride ourselves on knowing our consumers and mining insights that lead to new products and ideas. We believe that we have the ability to leverage our strong relationships with our retail customers and distributors
 a strong brand building track record
 and category management expertise to help new products
 brands and brand extensions gain distribution and consumer recognition
. We retain core in-house capabilities including sales
 marketing
 brand management
 customer relationships
 product development
 and supply-chain expertise
 while collaborating with a diversified pool of contract manufacturers and distributors to execute manufacturing and distribution. Outsourcing these competencies allows us to focus our efforts on innovation
 marketing and sales to meet consumer demands. Our lean infrastructure allows for significant flexibility
 speed-to-market and minimal capital investment
 which translates into relatively consistent and robust free cash flow generation over time
. Simply Good Foods has an experienced team of industry veterans with extensive experience across multiple branded consumer products
 food and nutrition categories. For example
 our President and Chief Executive Officer
 Joseph Scalzo
 has significant experience operating packaged foods businesses
 having served in various leadership roles at Dean Foods
 WhiteWave Foods
 The Gillette Company
 The Coca-Cola Company
 and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company. Our management team's extensive experience is complemented by the significant industry expertise of our directors&#160;James&#160;Kilts
 the former Chief Executive Officer of The Gillette Company and Nabisco
 and former President of Kraft USA and Oscar Mayer
 and David West
. Management believes the fragmented snacking category presents a substantial opportunity for consolidation and the opportunity to build
 through disciplined acquisitions
 a leading platform in the snacking space and broader food category. As a leader in nutritious snacking
 we believe we have the unique capability to leverage our operating platform and customer relationships to expand beyond the Atkins and Quest brands. In addition
 we believe the nutritious snacking category will continue to grow given its relatively low household penetration and favorable consumer trends of snacking
 health and wellness
 convenience and on-the-go consumption. Our experienced management team has deep expertise in brand building that we believe will help us to expand the business into additional brands and products in the snacking segment. Over time
 we expect to continue seeking to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities to complement our platform
Innovate and expand the portfolio of product offerings to meet consumer demand for &#8220;cleaner labels
Management expects that our ongoing efforts to meet consumer demand for &#8220;cleaner labels&#8221; will be effective at reaching self-directed low carbohydrate consumers who are focused on overall health
 wellness and &#8220;clean eating
&#8221; as part of their active lifestyle or for weight management. Management is committed to continually finding new and innovative formulations to reduce the number of product ingredients
 as well as using &#8220;better for you&#8221; ingredients like nuts
 fiber and whey protein in its existing products
 while maintaining and improving taste and quality. In addition
 we intend to continue to enhance
 strengthen and expand our product offerings with new and innovative flavors and forms
 simple ingredients and packaging alternatives
 all while maintaining a commitment to delivering products that meet our nutritional profile and provide the convenience that consumers crave. Our in-house research and development laboratories allow us to develop new products internally and bring them to market quickly through our contract manufacturing network without diverging from high standards of taste
 quality
 safety and nutritional content. Additionally
fifty-two week period ended August 29
 2020
 of Quest&#8217;s gross sales in the U.S. were through the mass retailer and grocery distribution channels. Our management believes there is opportunity for the brand to penetrate further those channels as well as other distribution channels such as convenience and club stores. In addition
 while shoppers have become heavier consumers of e-commerce purchases generally
August 29
 were through its e-commerce channel
 of Quest&#8217;s gross sales for the same period were through its e-commerce channel. We intend to leverage our brand recognition to develop further the distribution channels through which we reach consumers
We intend to continue to expand our marketing efforts to retain our existing loyal consumer base for both the Atkins and Quest brands. Consumers who purchase our products have shown a strong affinity for both the Atkins and Quest brands as evidenced by a relatively high level of servings per buyer
 per year. For our Atkins brand
 our historic core target consumer base has been individuals participating in branded weight management programs and for the Quest brand
 it has been individuals pursuing a performance-based
For both the Atkins and the Quest brands
 we have an active and growing digital and social presence
 using a comprehensive approach of search
 banner and search engine optimization efforts. We are a leader in social media
 with a top-tier presence on Facebook
 Instagram
 Pinterest
 Twitter and YouTube. We also have a growing network of social influencers
 who promote our products in their targeted&#160;social media posts. We believe that social media is a cost-effective way of continuing to attract and retain our consumers. We believe that our ongoing efforts to educate consumers about the benefits of a lower carbohydrate lifestyle will further reinforce our brands. For our Atkins brand
 we use targeted broadcast and streaming television and print ads with a celebrity-based campaign that attempts to motivate potential programmatic weight loss consumers to try the Atkins approach to healthier eating and weight loss as these Atkins consumers are our most loyal
 profitable and frequent purchasers. For our Quest brand
We intend to continue to make focused changes to our approach to consumer outreach to attract consumers beyond our historic core buyers. For the Atkins brand
 we intend to continue our marketing efforts to attract self-directed low carbohydrate eaters (those individuals not on a program diet) who buy and consume our Atkins products
 despite the fact that historically
 Atkins&#8217; marketing and advertising have not been targeted towards them. For our Quest brand
Our vision is to lead the nutritional snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient
 innovative
 great-tasting
Our core Atkins brand products consist of nutrition bars
To keep on-the-go consumers energized and fueled
 our Atkins nutrition bars offer a convenient and effective solution
 providing consumers with protein
 fiber and a delicious taste. Atkins offers two main types of nutrition bars: Atkins Meal Bars and Atkins Snack Bars. Atkins Meal Bars contain 13 to 17 grams of protein
 and are available in more than 10 different flavors. With 2 to 4 grams of net carbs
Our rich and creamy Atkins RTD shakes contain 10 to 15 grams of protein
 as well as other important vitamins and minerals. Available in a variety of flavors

Marketing
Our marketing efforts are designed to increase consumer awareness of and demand for our products. We employ a broad mix of marketing
 including coupons
 in-store product sampling
 consumer and trade events
 advertising (television
 online and print) and recipe and food plans
 to target our consumers. We also use online resources
 including social media sites
 to communicate with consumers and build interest in our brands. We use coupons (freestanding insert newspaper
 store register
 on-pack
 online and direct mail coupons) to help stimulate product trial and repeat purchases by providing consumers with economic incentives. Our advertising and use of online resources is aimed at increasing consumer preference and usage of our brands. Our trade promotions focus on obtaining retail feature and display support
We have devoted portions of our respective brand websites to interactive communities designed to promote consumer dialogue about the nutritional values and benefits of our products and suggestions for their use. Our sales and marketing team gathers information and feedback from consumers and retailers to enable us to better meet changing consumer needs. We also believe that an effective marketing tool is to share educational information through our brand websites to explain each brand&#8217;s approach to nutrition
 teaching consumers how to make smarter food choices and the nutritional qualities of our products. We also provide access to consumer service representatives to answer questions and educate consumers on nutrition
For both brands
 in order to facilitate awareness and knowledge of the health benefits of a low-carbohydrate
 low-sugar and protein rich eating approach
 we have established a variety of marketing and advertising strategies to connect with consumers
 including digital marketing and social media platforms
For both brands
 we have built large consumer followings. Beyond the core historic consumers for each of our brands
 we believe there is significant opportunity to increase household penetration for our products by expanding our marketing
fifty-two week period ended August 29
 2020
A portion of our sales is driven by new products
 and as a result
 we believe innovation is
 and will continue to be
 an important component of our business. We take a deliberate approach to new product development
 focusing on enhancing existing products
 innovating flavor and form varieties and expanding into adjacent snacking products. Our innovation model is designed to respond to competitive demands
Our innovation strategy is based on ongoing research into consumers&#8217; healthy lifestyle and nutritional needs. We pride ourselves on knowing our consumers and developing products that meet their needs. Providing variety in snacking options to our consumers is an important strategy in our product innovation. New flavors
Management believes that an important component of meeting consumers' nutritional needs is a focus on evolving current products and creating new products with cleaner and fewer ingredients. Accordingly
 we are committed to continually finding new and innovative formulations to reduce the number of ingredients in our products
 as well as using &#8220;better-for-you&#8221; ingredients like nuts
 fiber and whey protein
We maintain an in-house research and development team as well as market research and consumer insight capabilities. Through our research and development labs in El Segundo
 California and Louisville
 Colorado
 we control our brands&#8217; innovations and product formulations from the ground up. By developing new products
 prototypes and adjacencies in-house
 we facilitate our core competencies in product innovation
In addition
 as part of our innovation process
 we collaborate with nationally recognized third-party flavor houses and product development firms for new product development and then conduct our own proprietary consumer research to identify and improve upon new product concepts. We plan to continue to conduct extensive consumer research in order to develop successful new products including product flavor and concept testing
Management also believes the fragmented snacking category presents a substantial opportunity for consolidation and the opportunity to build
 through disciplined acquisitions
 a leading platform in the snacking space and broader food category. As a leader in nutritious snacking
 management believes we have the unique capability to leverage our operating platform and customer relationships to expand beyond our current brands. Our experienced management team has deep expertise in brand building to expand the business into additional brands and products in the snacking segment. Simply Good Foods is actively seeking to identify and evaluate new acquisition opportunities to complement our existing portfolio
 and sees significant opportunity for growth and synergies in complementary adjacent snacking categories such as sports/active and adult nutritional snacks
 salty snacks and protein snacks
We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction
 trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We believe the protection of our trademarks
 copyrights
 patents
 domain names
 trade dress and trade secrets are important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark
 copyright
 patent
 trade dress and trade secret laws
We compete primarily with nutritional snacking brands in large retail and ecommerce environments. The nutritional snacking industry is fragmented and highly competitive
 and includes a number of diverse competitors. Our identified branded competitors include
 but are not limited to
 CLIF Bar
 KIND bars
 Special K
 Slimfast
 Muscle Milk
 ONE bar
 Pure Protein
low-carbohydrate
 low-sugar
We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. However
 a number of companies in the nutritional snacking and weight management industry have greater financial resources
 more comprehensive product lines
 broader market presence
 longer standing relationships with distributors and suppliers
 longer operating histories
 greater distribution capabilities
We operate an asset-light business model. For the manufacture of our products
 we subcontract with contract manufacturers
 and as a result
 our operations are highly flexible and require minimal capital expenditure. The supply chain for our international business also uses exclusively contract manufacturers
 and is completely separate from our North American supply chain
. The majority of our products are shipped directly to one central warehouse for the Atkins brand and one for the Quest brand
 each of which is a leased warehouse managed by the same third-party logistics provider who then distributes products to customers. We are in the process of combining these two warehouses into a single warehouse
 which we expect to complete in 2021. For certain customers
 RTD shakes are shipped directly from the contract manufacturer to the customer's location. In addition
 our use of demand forecasting and vendor-managed inventory systems enable us to meet shipping demands
The principal ingredients to manufacture our products include chocolate and other coatings
 dairy
 proteins
 soy and nuts. Our packaging supplies consist of flexible film
 cartons
 tetra paper and corrugate. All of our core ingredients are purchased according to rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. These core ingredients are generally available in adequate quantities from several suppliers
 and to date
 core ingredient supplies have not been affected by the economic effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We competitively bid with major suppliers to source competitively priced
 quality ingredients and packaging that meet our standards. For certain ingredients such as milk protein concentrate
 whey proteins
 chocolate coatings
 some nuts
 soy crisps and liquid soy
 we establish direct purchasing agreements with suppliers
 under which our contract manufacturers source ingredients to produce finished products. We also actively manage the cost of our packaging needs
 such as corrugated
 film
We rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. The contract manufacturers schedule and purchase ingredient inventory independently
 according to parameters set in their contracts and forecasts we provide. Our contract manufacturers are regularly audited by third parties and are required to follow rigorous food safety guidelines. We believe our contract manufacturers have capacity to meet our anticipated supply needs
 although short-term high demand can cause disruptions. We monitor both near-term and long-term capacity as well as fulfillment rates and overall performance of our manufacturing partners and qualify alternate suppliers as needed. In general
 we receive finished products from our contract manufacturers
 which includes all packaging and ingredients used
 as well as an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced. These finished products are then shipped directly to our respective distribution centers
 or shipped directly from the contract manufacturer to the customer
We have two leased distribution centers in Greenfield
 Indiana
 referred to collectively as the Distribution Centers
579
For the majority of our customers
 our logistics provider distributes the finished goods via truckloads from our Distribution Centers
 which first flow through regional terminals. At the terminals
 our orders are consolidated with other company&#8217;s products being shipped to the customer. The finished goods are then distributed to retailer distribution centers. The regular weekly shipments and consolidation have reduced our costs. For some products
 we ship directly to customers from our contract manufacturer through a third-party logistics provider. In addition
 in some instances
We have a wide variety of customers across the mass
 food
 club
 drug
 and e-commerce channels. A substantial majority of our sales are generated from a limited number of retailers. Sales to our largest retailer
 Walmart
 represented approximately 
 is through their club channel. Sales to our next largest retailer
 Amazon
 of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2020. No other customer represents more than 10% of sales. For addition information
We rely on sales to a limited number of retailers for a substantial majority of our net sales
 and losing one or more such retailers may materially harm our business. In addition
 we maintain &#8220;at will&#8221; contracts with these retailers
. We aim to ensure that our consumers may access our brand in the way that best suits their lifestyles by offering home delivery of our products. We sell our products on Atkins.com
Food safety and quality is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that consumers receive safe
 high quality food products. Our products are manufactured in facilities that have programs and controls in place regarding consistent quality and food safety. Product attributes
 such as taste
 aroma
 texture and appearance are regularly monitored. Good Manufacturing Practices and comprehensive food safety programs are designed to produce a safe
 wholesome product. Our suppliers are required to have equally robust processes in place and confirm their compliance with product specifications with Letters of Guaranty and Certificates of Analysis for shipments of core ingredients to be used in our products. Finally

 of total net sales. Our international supply chain is self-sufficient and run by a lean team solely focused on international operations. Similar to U.S. operations
 international operations utilize contract manufacturers for products
Our operations are organized into two operating segments
 Atkins and Quest
 which are aggregated into one reporting segment
 due to similar financial
 economic and operating characteristics. The operating segments are also similar in the following areas: (a) the nature of the products; (b) the nature of the production processes; (c) the methods used to distribute products to customers
 (d) the type of customer for the products

 pandemic or similar widespread public health concern
 such as COVID-19
 could negatively affect our operations
 liquidity
 financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 outbreak situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change
 including but not limited to changes that may materially affect the operations of our customers and supply chain partners
Pandemics
 epidemics or disease outbreaks may affect demand for our products because quarantines or other government restrictions on movement may cause erratic consumer purchase behavior. Governmental or societal impositions of restrictions on public gatherings
 especially if prolonged
 may have adverse effects on in-person traffic to retail stores and
 in turn
 our business. Even the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect traffic to our store-based retail customers and
 in turn
 our business
 liquidity
 financial condition and results of operations
The spread of pandemics
 epidemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 may also disrupt our third-party business partners&#8217; ability to meet their obligations to us
 which may negatively affect our operations. These third parties include those who supply our ingredients
 packaging
 and other necessary operating materials
 contract manufacturers
 distributors
 and logistics and transportation services providers. Ports and other channels of entry may be closed or operate at only a portion of capacity
 as workers may be prohibited or otherwise unable to report to work and means of transporting products within regions or countries may be limited for the same reason. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak
 transport restrictions related to quarantines or travel bans have been put in place and global supply may become constrained
 each of which may cause price increases or shortages of certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products and/or we may experience disruptions to our operations. Further
 our contract manufacturers&#8217; ability to manufacture our products may be impaired by any material disruption to their employee staffing
 procurement
 manufacturing
Our results of operations depend on
 among other things
 our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing customers
 to attract new consumers and to provide products that appeal to consumers at prices they are willing and able to pay. Our ability to implement our innovation
 advertising
 display and promotion activities designed to maintain and increase our sales volumes on a timely basis may be negatively affected because of modifications to retailer shelf reset timing or retailer pullback on in-store display and promotional activities during the COVID-19 outbreak or similar situations. Retailers may also alter their normal inventory receiving and product restocking practices during pandemics
 epidemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19
Workforce limitations and travel restrictions resulting from pandemics
 epidemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 and related government actions may affect many aspects of our business. If a significant percentage of our workforce cannot work
 including because of illness
 travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks
 our operations may be negatively affected. In addition
 pandemics or disease outbreaks could cause a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries
Adverse and uncertain economic conditions
 such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income
 increased unemployment or a decline in consumer confidence because of the COVID-19 outbreak or similar situations
 could have an adverse effect on distributor
 retailer and consumer demand for our products. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions
 including because of COVID-19 or similar outbreaks
 and any resulting recession or slowed economic growth
Our consolidated results of operations for the full fiscal year ended August 29
 2020 were affected by changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior due to COVID-19. After the brief pantry loading period in mid-March 2020
 the nutritional snacking category saw a marked decrease in shopping trips (particularly in the mass channel) and fewer usage occasions. This affected our portable and convenient on-the-go products
 especially the nutrition and protein bar portion of our business for both our Atkins and Quest brands. As home confinement restrictions began to ease
During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020
 the improvement in category trends plateaued. While our Quest brand has outperformed its portion of the nutritious snaking segment
 the performance of our Atkins brand
 which is part of the weight management portion of the market
 has remained slower due to the temporary softer interest in weight management for consumers
Our efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may be unsuccessful
 and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control
 including the duration and severity of any pandemic
 epidemic or disease outbreak
The nutritious snacking industry is large and intensely competitive because consumers are seeking simpler
 &#8220;cleaner&#8221; and more sustainable eating habits. Our business is committed to providing people a more nutritious way to eat. As a result
 we compete in the nutritional snacking industry
 which is included in the general snack foods industry. Competitive factors in the nutritional snacking industry include product quality
 taste
 brand awareness among consumers
 nutritional content
 simpler and less processed ingredients
 innovation of &#8220;on-trend&#8221; snacks
 variety of snacks offered
 grocery aisle placement
 access to retailer shelf space
 price
 advertising and promotion
 product packaging and package design. We compete in this market against numerous multinational
 regional and local companies principally based on our low-carb
 low-sugar and protein-rich nutritional content
 product taste and quality
 our brand recognition and loyalty
 marketing
 advertising
Our competitors in the nutritional snacking industry include companies selling branded weight loss programs who support these programs by offering a wide variety of diet foods
 meal replacement bars
 shakes and nutritional supplements
 and through the promotion of weight loss and weight management approaches such as keto
 paleo
 vegan
 gluten free
 vegetarian and others. Views towards nutritional snacking
 weight loss and management
 and other nutritional approaches
 are cyclical and trendy
 with constantly changing consumer perceptions. Besides remaining competitive through the quality of our products
 consumer perceptions of the Atkins&#8217; weight management approach and the effectiveness of a low-carb
 low-sugar and protein-rich eating approach for both our Atkins and Quest brands must continue to be viewed favorably
 or our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. For the Atkins brand
 if other weight management approaches become more popular
 or are generally perceived to be more effective
Some of our competitors have resources substantially greater than we have and sell brands that may be more widely recognized than our brands. Our current and potential competitors may offer products similar to our products
 a wider range of products than we offer
 and may offer such products at more competitive prices than we do. Local or regional markets often have significant additional competitors
 many of whom offer products similar to ours and may have unique ties to regional or national retail chains. Any increased competition from new entrants into the nutritional snacking industry or any increased success by existing competition could cause reductions in our sales
 require us to reduce our prices
 or both
 which could materially and adversely affect our business
If we fail to implement our growth strategies successfully
 timely
 or at all
Our future success depends
 largely
 on our ability to implement our growth strategies effectively
 including expanding on a low-carb
 low-sugar and protein-rich healthy lifestyle while maintaining the traditional identity of our brands and the loyalty of our consumers. However
 we may fail in implementing our growth strategies effectively. On November 7
 2019
 we completed our acquisition of Quest
 a healthy lifestyle food company. We expect to continue focusing on nutritional snacking and intend to add additional brands to our product portfolio. As a multi-brand business
 we face increased complexities and greater uncertainty regarding consumer trends and demands than as a single-brand business. Our ability to expand successfully our nutritional snacking brands and other growth strategies depends on
 among other things
 our ability to identify
 and successfully cater to
 new demographics and consumer trends
 develop new and innovative products
 identify and acquire additional product lines and businesses
 secure shelf space in grocery stores
 wholesale clubs and other retailers
 increase consumer awareness of our brands
 enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third-party retailers and other potential distributors of our products
 and compete with numerous other companies and products. In addition
 regarding our Atkins brand
 self-directed lifestyle consumers of products may have different preferences and spending habits than the consumers of traditional weight loss products. We may not succeed in reaching and maintaining the loyalty of new consumers to the same extent
 or at all
Regarding our Atkins brand
If we cannot identify and capture new audiences and demographics
 our ability to integrate additional brands successfully will be adversely affected. Accordingly
 we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategies
 expand our brands
 or continue to maintain growth in our sales at our current rate
 or at all. If we fail to implement our growth strategies or if we invest resources in growth strategies that ultimately prove unsuccessful
 our sales and profitability may be negatively affected
 which would materially and adversely affect our business
If we do not continually enhance our brand recognition
 increase distribution of our products
 attract new consumers to our brands and introduce new and innovative products
 either on a timely basis or at all
The nutritional snacking industry is subject to rapid and frequent changes in consumer demands. Because consumers are constantly seeking new products and strategies to achieve their healthy eating goals
 our success relies heavily on our ability to continue to develop and market new and innovative products and extensions. New product sales represent a growing and important portion of our net sales. To respond to new and evolving consumer demands
 achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional
 weight management
 technological and other developments
 we must constantly introduce new and innovative products into the market
 some of which may not be accepted by consumers
 may be sent to market prematurely or may not be consistent with our quality and taste standards. Accordingly
 we may not succeed in timely developing
 introducing or marketing any new or enhanced products. If we cannot commercialize new products
 our revenue may not grow as expected
 which would materially and adversely affect our business
We rely on sales to a limited number of retailers for a substantial majority of our net sales
 and losing one or more such retailers may materially harm our business. In addition
 we maintain &#8220;at will&#8221; contracts with these retailers
A substantial majority of our sales are generated from a limited number of retailers. Sales to our largest retailer
 Walmart
 represented approximately&#160;
 is through their club channel. Sales to our next largest retailer
 Amazon
. Although the composition of our significant retailers may vary from period-to-period
 we expect that most of our net sales will continue to come from a relatively small number of retailers for the foreseeable future. These retailers may take actions that affect us for reasons we cannot anticipate or control
 such as their financial condition
 changes in their business strategy or operations
 the perceived quality of their products and introducing competing products. There can be no assurance that Walmart
 Amazon or our other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past
Our retailers rarely provide us with firm
 long- or short-term volume purchase commitments. As a result
 we could have periods with little to no orders for our products while still incurring costs related to workforce maintenance
 marketing
 general corporate and debt service. Furthermore
 despite operating in different channels
 our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from competition
 retailers may take actions that negatively affect us. We may not find new retailers to supplement our revenue in periods when we experience reduced purchase orders
 or recover fixed costs because of experiencing reduced purchase orders. Periods of reduced purchase orders could materially and adversely affect our business
Conversely
 occasionally
 we may experience unanticipated increases in orders of our products from these retailers that can create supply chain problems and may cause unfilled orders. If we cannot meet increased demand for our products
 our reputation with these retailers may be harmed. Unanticipated fluctuations in product requirements could cause fluctuations in our results from quarter-to-quarter. Consolidation among retailers may also materially and adversely affect our results. An increase in the concentration of our sales to large customers may negatively affect our profitability due to the effect of higher shelving fees and reduced volumes of product sold. Furthermore
 as retailers consolidate or account for a larger percentage of our sales
Our results depend on our ability to drive revenue growth
 in part
 by expanding the distribution channels for our products. Our ability to do so may be limited by an inability to secure new retailers
 or maintain or add shelf and retail space for our products. Shelf and retail space for nutritional snacks is limited and subject to competitive and other pressures. There can be no assurance that retailers will provide sufficient
 or any
 shelf space
Unattractive shelf placement and pricing may put our products at a disadvantage compared to those of our competitors. Even if we obtain shelf space or preferable shelf placement
 our new and existing products may fail to achieve the sales expectations set by our retailers
 potentially causing these retailers to remove our products from their shelves. Additionally
label products in the product categories in which we compete could create more pressure for shelf space and placement for branded products within each such category
We believe our consumers generally shop for our brands first
 then choose a product form or flavor second. Our ability to shelf all of our brands' products together in one area at retail enables consumers to easily find all products when shopping. Any customer decision to separate our brands&#8217; products by form (bars

Changes in consumer preferences
 perceptions of healthy food products and discretionary spending may negatively affect our brand loyalty and net sales
 and materially and adversely affect our business
We focus on products that are
 or that we believe are
 perceived to have positive effects on health
 and compete in a market that relies on innovation and evolving consumer preferences. The processed food industry in general
 and the nutritional snacking industry in particular
 is subject to changing consumer trends
 demands and preferences. Emerging science
 and our nutritional approach and theories regarding health are constantly evolving. Products or methods of eating once considered healthy may become disfavored by consumers
Trends within the food industry change often and our failure to anticipate
 identify or react to changes in these trends could
 among other things
 lead to reduced consumer demand
 shelf or retail space and price reductions
 and could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. Additionally
 certain ingredients used in our products may become negatively perceived by consumers
 resulting in reformulation of existing products to remove such ingredients
 which may negatively affect the taste or other qualities of our products. Factors that may affect consumer perception of healthy products include dietary trends and attention to different nutritional aspects of foods
 concerns regarding the health effects of specific ingredients and nutrients
Consumer perceptions of the nutritional profile of low-carb
 low-sugar and protein-rich eating practices and products may shift and consumers may no longer perceive products with fewer carbohydrates
 higher levels of protein
 higher levels of fat and additional fiber as healthy. Approaches regarding weight management and healthy lifestyles are the subject of numerous studies and publications
 often with differentiating views and opinions
 some of which may be adverse to us. Conflicting scientific information on what constitutes good nutrition
 diet fads or other weight loss trends may materially and adversely affect our business. Our success depends
 in part
 on our ability to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and other consumer trends and to offer products that appeal to their needs and preferences on a timely and affordable basis. A change in consumer discretionary spending
 due to economic downturn or other reasons may also materially and adversely affect our sales
 and our business
The loss of
 a disruption in or an inability to efficiently operate our fulfillment network could materially and adversely affect our business
For our U.S. operations
 we utilize distribution centers in Greenfield
 Indiana
 one for our Quest brand and one for our Atkins brand. A substantially portion of our inventory is shipped directly to our retailers from these centers by a third-party operator. We rely significantly on the orderly operation of these centers. If complications arise
 or if a particular facility is damaged or destroyed
 our ability to deliver inventory timely for that brand will be significantly impaired
We rely on a single-sourced logistics provider for distribution and product shipments in the United States. Our utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks that may affect the ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs including increases in fuel prices
 employee strikes and inclement weather. Occasionally
 we may change third-party transportation providers and we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition
 we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change
Disruptions at our distribution facilities or in our operations due to natural or man-made disasters
 pandemics (such as COVID-19) or other disease outbreaks
 fire
 flooding
 terrorism or other catastrophic events
 system failure
Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of our core ingredients
The core ingredients used in manufacturing our products include soy
 nuts
 dairy
 protein
 fiber and cocoa. We rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide these core ingredients
 a portion of which are international companies. There may be a limited market supply of any of these core ingredients. Any disruption in supply could materially and adversely affect our business
 particularly our profitability and margins. Events that adversely affect our suppliers could impair our ability to obtain core ingredient inventories in the quantities desired. Such events include problems with our suppliers&#8217; businesses
 finances
 labor relations
 ability to import core ingredients
 costs
 production
 insurance
 reputation and weather conditions during growing
 harvesting or shipping
 including flood
 drought

Our financial performance depends largely on our ability to purchase core ingredients and packaging in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We may not have continued supply
 pricing or exclusive access to core ingredients and packaging from these sources. Any of our suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationships with us. We may be adversely affected by increased demand for our specific core ingredients
 a reduction in overall supply of required core ingredients
 suppliers raising their prices
 and increases in the cost of packaging and distributing core ingredients. Additionally
We rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. If any of these manufacturers experience adverse effects on their businesses or cannot continue manufacturing our products at required levels
 on a timely basis
 or at all
 we may be forced to seek other manufacturers. In addition
 our contract manufacturers independently contract for and obtain some of the core ingredients in our products. If contract manufactures cannot obtain these core ingredients in the required amounts or at all
 their ability to manufacture our products would be adversely affected. It could take a significant period of time to locate and qualify such alternative production sources. We may not be able to identify and qualify new manufacturers promptly that could allocate sufficient capacity to meet our requirements
 which could adversely affect our ability to make timely deliveries of products. Furthermore
 we may be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms with existing or new manufacturers as favorable as what we currently enjoy. In addition
We are subject to risks associated with protection of our trade secrets by our third-party contract manufacturers. If our contract manufacturers fail to protect our trade secrets
 either intentionally or unintentionally
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we experience significant increased demand for our products
 or need to replace an existing supplier or manufacturer
 additional supplies of core ingredients or manufacturers may not be available when required
 on acceptable terms
 or at all. Suppliers may not allocate sufficient capacity to meet our requirements
 fill our orders promptly or meet our strict quality standards. Even if our existing suppliers and manufacturers can expand their capacities to meet our needs
 or we can find new sources of core ingredients or new contract manufacturers
 we may encounter delays in production
 inconsistencies in quality and added costs. We may not be able to pass increased costs onto the consumer immediately
 if at all
 which may decrease or eliminate our profitability. Any manufacturing and/or supply disruptions or cost increases could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand for our products and result in lower net sales and profitability
We rely in part on our third-party contract manufacturers to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability of contract manufacturers to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could cause product recall
 which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and subject us to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause or be claimed to cause illness or physical harm. Our products implicate risks such as product contamination
 spoilage
 product tampering
 other adulteration
 mislabeling and misbranding. We also license certain products that contain our brand and logo
 but which are produced and distributed exclusively by third parties of whom we have limited control. In addition
 we do not own our warehouse facilities
Under certain circumstances
 we may be required to
 or may voluntarily
 recall or withdraw products. For example
 in 2016
 as part of a larger national recall by several other food companies
 we incurred losses
 including recalled product because of potential contamination from an ingredient supplied to one of our third-party manufacturers at their manufacturing center. While the contamination did not result in any consumer illness
 and we were indemnified for a substantial portion of our direct product loss
 the recall may have damaged the reputation for our Atkins brand. A widespread recall or withdrawal of any of ours or licensed products may negatively and significantly affect our sales and profitability and could cause significant losses depending on the costs of the recall
 destruction of product inventory
 reduction in product availability
We may be subject to claims or lawsuits
 including class actions lawsuits (which could significantly increase any adverse settlements or rulings) or judgments
 resulting in liability for actual or claimed injuries
 illness or death. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. Whether or not a product liability claim or lawsuit is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued
 the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential consumers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover
covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance in an amount we believe to be adequate. However
 we may incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed our insurance coverage. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our business
Ingredient and packaging costs are volatile and may rise significantly
We negotiate the prices for large quantities of core ingredients
 such as soy
 nuts
 dairy
 protein
 fiber and cocoa
 and packaging materials. Several ingredients are manufactured in Canada. Costs of ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions difficult to predict
 including global competition for resources
 fluctuations in currency and exchange rates
 weather conditions
 natural or man-made disasters
We do not use hedges for availability of any core ingredients. Any material upward movement in core ingredient pricing could negatively affect our margins if we cannot pass these costs on to our consumers
 or our sales if we are forced to increase our prices. If we are unsuccessful in managing our ingredient and packaging costs
 if we cannot increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes
 then such increases in costs will materially and adversely affect our business
Certain of our core ingredient contracts have minimum volume commitments that could require purchases without matching revenue during weaker sales periods. Future core ingredient prices may be effected by new laws or regulations
 tariffs
 suppliers&#8217; allocations to other purchasers
 interruptions in production by suppliers
 natural disasters
Severe weather conditions and natural disasters such as fires
 floods
 droughts
 hurricanes
 earthquakes and tornadoes can affect crop supplies
 manufacturing facilities and distribution activities
Severe weather conditions and natural disasters
 such as fires
 floods
 droughts
 frosts
 hurricanes
 earthquakes
 tornadoes
 insect infestations and plant disease
 may affect the supply of core ingredients used to make food products
 or may prevent the manufacturing or distribution of food products by third parties. Competing manufacturers might be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters
 depending on the location of their sources of supplies and manufacturing or distribution facilities. If supplies of core ingredients available to us are reduced
 we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms
 which could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. In addition
 because we rely on few contract manufacturers for a majority of our manufacturing needs and a single distribution warehouse for each of our key brands
If the perception of our brands or organizational reputation are damaged
 our consumers
 distributors and retailers may react negatively
 which could materially and adversely affect our business
We believe we have built our reputation on the efficacy of our nutritional approach
 and the high-quality flavor and nutritional content of our food. We must protect and expand on the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer affinity for our brands could significantly reduce our value and damage our business. For example
 negative third-party reports regarding the Atkins or Quest nutritional approach or the quality of our food
 whether accurate or not
 may adversely affect consumer perceptions
 which could cause the brand&#8217;s value to suffer and adversely affect our business. In addition
 if we are forced
 or voluntarily elect
 to recall certain products
 including frozen foods or licensed products over which we may not have full quality control
 the public perception of the quality of our food may be diminished. We may also be adversely affected by news or other negative publicity
 regardless of accuracy
 regarding other aspects of our business
 such as public health concerns
 illness
 safety
 security breaches of confidential consumer or employee information
 employee related claims relating to alleged employment discrimination
 health care and benefit issues or government or industry findings about our retailers
 distributors
As part of our marketing initiatives
 we have contracted with certain public figures to market and endorse our products. While we maintain specific selection criteria and are diligent in our efforts to seek out public figures that resonate genuinely and effectively with our consumer audience
 the individuals we choose to market and endorse our products may fall into negative favor with the general public. Because our consumers may associate the public figures that market and endorse our products with us
Negative information
 including inaccurate information
 about us on social media may harm our reputation and brand
 which could have a material and adverse effect on our business
There has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar channels that provide individuals with access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate
 as is its effect. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post
 often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information
 including inaccurate information
 is potentially limitless. Information about our business and/or products may be posted on such platforms at any time. Negative views regarding our products and the efficacy of the Atkins or Quest eating approaches have been posted on various social media platforms
 may continue to be posted in the future
 and are out of our control. Regardless of their accuracy or authenticity
 such information and views may be adverse to our interests and may harm our reputation and brand. The harm may be immediate without affording an opportunity for redress or correction. Ultimately
 the risks associated with any such negative publicity cannot be eliminated or completely mitigated and may materially and adversely affect our business
We must expend resources to maintain consumer awareness of our brands
To remain competitive and expand and keep shelf placement for our products
 we may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending to maintain and increase consumer awareness
 protect and grow our existing market share or promote new products
 which could affect our operating results. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures may be required to maintain or improve our brand&#8217;s market position or to introduce new products to the market
 and participants in our industry are increasingly engaging with non-traditional media
 including consumer outreach through social media and web-based channels
 which may not prove successful. An increase in our marketing and advertising efforts may not maintain our current reputation
 or lead to increased brand awareness. Moreover
 we may not maintain current awareness of our brand due to any potential fragmentation of our marketing efforts as we continue to focus on a low-carb
 low-sugar and protein-rich nutritional approach for everyday snacking consumers. In addition
 we consistently evaluate our product lines to determine whether to discontinue certain products. Discontinuing product lines may increase our profitability but could reduce our sales and hurt our brands
 and a reduction in sales of certain products could cause a reduction in sales of other products. The discontinuation of product lines may have an adverse effect on our business
If we cannot maintain or increase prices
We rely in part on price increases to offset cost increases and improve the profitability of our business. Our ability to maintain prices or effectively implement price increases may be affected by several factors
 including competition
 effectiveness of our marketing programs
 the continuing strength of our brand
 market demand and general economic conditions
 including inflationary pressures. During challenging economic times
 consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price premium for our branded products and may shift purchases to lower-priced or other value offerings
 making it more difficult for us to maintain prices and/or effectively implement price increases. In addition
 our retail partners and distributors may pressure us to rescind price increases we have announced or already implemented
 whether through a change in list price or increased promotional activity. If we cannot maintain or increase prices for our products or must increase promotional activity
 our margins may be adversely affected. Furthermore
 price increases generally result in volume losses
 as consumers purchase fewer units. If such losses are greater than expected or if we lose distribution due to a price increase
 our business
We intend to grow through acquisitions or joint ventures and we may not successfully integrate
As part of our strategic initiatives
 we intend to pursue acquisitions or joint ventures
 such as our acquisition of Quest. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring brands with products that complement our existing products and identifying and acquiring brands in new categories and new geographies to expand our platform of nutritional snacks and potentially other food products. Although we regularly evaluate multiple acquisition candidates
 we cannot be certain that we can successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates
 negotiate acquisitions of identified candidates on favorable terms
Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties
 including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets
 which could increase target prices and/or materially and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable terms
 the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions
 the risk we improperly value and price a target
 the potential inability to identify all of the risks and liabilities inherent in a target company or assets notwithstanding our diligence efforts
 the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business and additional strain on our existing personnel
 increased leverage resulting from the additional debt financing that may be required to complete an acquisition
 dilution of our net current book value per share if we issue additional equity securities to finance an acquisition
Any future acquisitions may pose risks associated with entry into new geographic markets
 including outside the United States and our current international markets
 distribution channels
 lines of business or product categories
 where we may not have significant prior experience and where we may not be as successful or profitable as we are in businesses and geographic regions where we have greater familiarity and brand recognition. Potential acquisitions may entail significant transaction costs and require significant management time and distraction from our core business
Besides the risks above
 even when acquisitions are completed
 integration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties. These include failure to achieve financial or operating objectives regarding an acquisition
 systems
 operational and managerial controls and procedures
 the need to modify systems or to add management resources
 difficulties in the integration and retention of consumers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies
 amortization of acquired assets (which would reduce future reported earnings)
 possible adverse short-term effects on cash flows or operating results
 integrating personnel with diverse backgrounds and organizational cultures
We may not realize the expected benefits of the Quest acquisition we completed in November 2019
The success of the Quest acquisition will depend
 in part
 on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated benefits from integrating Quest&#8217;s business with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex
 costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the operations of Quest&#8217;s business include
unanticipated issues in integrating co-manufacturing
 logistics
 information
possible inconsistencies in standards
 controls
 procedures and policies
failure to retain key employees
increasing the scope
unanticipated issues
We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue
 earnings or operating efficiency that each company had achieved historically or might achieve separately. In addition
 we may not accomplish the integration of Quest&#8217;s business smoothly
 successfully or within the anticipated costs or time frame. If we experience difficulties with the integration process
 the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully
 or at all
Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our company
August&#160;29
 2020
 in outstanding indebtedness and a revolving credit facility with availability of $75 million. Our current and future debt level and the terms of our debt arrangements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies. In addition
 under the credit facilities governing our indebtedness
 we have granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of our assets
Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance
 which will be affected by the other risk factors described herein. If we do not generate enough cash flow to pay our debt service obligations
 we may have to refinance all or part of our existing debt
 sell our assets
 borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to take any of these actions timely
 on terms satisfactory to us
The credit facilities governing our existing debt arrangements contain certain financial and other covenants. Our revolving credit facility has a maximum total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 6.25:1.00 (with a reduction to 6.00:1.00 on and after the third anniversary of the closing date of the credit facilities) contingent on credit extensions in excess of 30% of the total amount of commitments available under the revolving credit facility
 and limitations on our ability to
 among other things
 incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions
 liens
 indebtedness
 certain acquisitions and investments
 consolidations
 mergers
 reorganizations and other fundamental changes
 payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders
 and prepayments of material subordinated debt
 in each case
 subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities may cause an event of default. The credit facilities governing our existing debt arrangements bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase
 variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements
Our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates that use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) as a benchmark rate. On July 27
 2017
 the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;)
 which regulates&#160;LIBOR
 announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit&#160;LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the &#8220;FCA Announcement&#8221;). The FCA announcement indicates that the continuation of&#160;LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2021
 and&#160;LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark. Recent proposals for&#160;LIBOR reforms may cause the establishment of new methods of calculating&#160;LIBOR or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates. Although our revolving credit facility provides for successor base rates
 the successor base rates may be related to&#160;LIBOR
 and the consequences of any potential cessation
 modification or other reform of&#160;LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time. If&#160;LIBOR ceases to exist
 we may need to amend our revolving credit facility
 and we cannot predict what alternative interest rate(s) will be negotiated with our counterparties. As a result
 our interest expense may increase
Our products must comply with various FDA rules and regulations
 including those regarding product manufacturing
 food safety
 required testing and appropriate labeling of our products. The FDA has not defined nutrient content claims regarding low carbohydrates
 but has not objected to using net carbohydrate information on food labels if the label adequately explains how the term is used so it would not be false or misleading to consumers. The FDA requires all carbohydrates per serving to be listed on the Nutrition Facts Panel (&#8220;NFP&#8221;) of a package. Besides the information on the NFP
 we use the term &#8220;net carbohydrate&#8221; (or &#8220;net carbs&#8221;) on our Atkins' packaging to assist consumers in tracking the carbohydrates in that serving of food that effect their blood sugar (glucose) levels. We determine the number of net carbs in a serving by subtracting fiber
 and sugar alcohols if any
 from the actual number of carbohydrates listed on the NFP. Fiber and sugar alcohols can be subtracted from the carbohydrates because they minimally effect blood sugar levels. It is possible that FDA regulations and/or their interpretations may change related to
 for example
 definitions of certain of our core ingredients
 such as fiber
 labeling requirements for describing other ingredients or nutrients
 such as sugar alcohols or protein
 or disclosures of any ingredient labeled as genetically modified (&#8220;GMO&#8221;). As such
 there is a risk that our products could become non-compliant with the FDA&#8217;s regulations
In addition
 if FDA or other regulations restrict us from labeling and marketing certain ingredients or product attributes
 such as fiber or &#8220;net carb&#8221; count
 we may not effectively reach our target demographics
 promote what we believe to be the benefits of our products or communicate that our products are composed of what we consider to be low-carb
We must rely on the contract manufacturers we engage to produce our products to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Although we require our contract manufacturers to be compliant with regulatory requirements
Conflicts between state and federal law regarding definitions of our core ingredients
 and labeling requirements
 may lead to non-compliance with state and local regulations. For example
 certain states may maintain narrower definitions of certain ingredients
 and more stringent labeling requirements
 of which we are unaware. Any non-compliance at the state or local level could materially and adversely affect our business
Our advertising is regulated for accuracy
 and if our advertising is determined to be false or misleading
Our advertising is subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act
 which prohibits dissemination of false or misleading advertising. In addition
 the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus
 Inc.
 which we refer to as NAD
monitors national advertising and entertains inquiries and challenges from competing companies and consumers. Should our advertising be determined to be false or misleading
 we may have to pay damages
 withdraw our campaign and possibly face fines or sanctions
Disruptions in the worldwide economy may materially and adversely affect our business
Adverse and uncertain economic conditions
 such as those caused by COVID-19
 may affect distributor
 retailer and consumer demand for our products. In addition
 our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers
 contract manufacturers
 distributors
 retailers
 consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns
 making it more difficult to sell our premium products. Due to the relative costs of our products
 during economic downturns
 it may be more difficult to convince consumers to switch to or continue to use our brands or convince new users to choose our brands without expensive sampling programs and price promotions. In particular
 consumers may reduce their purchases of products without GMOs
 gluten or preservatives when there are conventional offerings of similar products
 which generally have lower retail prices. In addition
 consumers may choose to purchase private-label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. Distributors and retailers may become more conservative in their ordering in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend on
 among other things
 our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing distributors and retailers
Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities
 increase our operating costs
Elements of our business
 including the production
 storage
 distribution
 sale
 display
 advertising
 marketing
 labeling
 health and safety practices
 transportation and use of many of our products
 are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal
 state and local governmental agencies in the United States
 and the laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products or components thereof
 such as packaging
 may be made
 manufactured or sold. These laws
 regulations and interpretations thereof may change
 sometimes dramatically
 because of a variety of factors
 including political
laws and programs aimed at reducing
taxation requirements
anti-corruption laws
 including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
 as amended (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;)
economic sanctions and anti-boycott laws
 including laws administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury
laws relating to export
 re-export
 transfer
 tariffs and import controls
 including the Export Administration Regulations
New laws
 regulations or governmental policies and their related interpretations
 or changes in any of the foregoing
 including taxes
 tariffs or other limitations on the sale of our products
 ingredients in our products or commodities used in the production of our products
 may alter the environment in which we do business and
 therefore
 may affect our operating results or increase our costs or liabilities. In addition
 if we fail to adhere to such laws and regulations
 we could be subject to regulatory investigations
 civil or criminal sanctions
 and class action litigation
We operate mainly in North America and
 therefore
 are particularly susceptible to adverse regulations
 economic climate
 consumer trends
 market fluctuations
 including commodity price fluctuations or supply shortages of key ingredients
 and other adverse events in North America. The concentration of our businesses in North America could present challenges and may increase the likelihood that an adverse event in North America would disproportionately materially and adversely affect product sales
Occasionally
 we may be party to various claims and litigation. We evaluate these claims and litigation to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate
 if possible
 potential losses. We may establish reserves
There is an additional risk that potential litigation may lead to adverse publicity
 consumer confusion
 distrust and additional legal challenges for us. Should we become subject to related or additional unforeseen lawsuits
 including claims related to our products
 labeling or advertising
 which may vary under state and federal rules and regulations
 consumers may avoid purchasing our products or seek alternative products
Any consumer loss of confidence in the truthfulness of our labeling or ingredient claims would be difficult and costly to overcome and may significantly reduce our brand value. For example
 publications and other third-party commentary may vary in opinion regarding calculations of net carbs and vary on approach to calculations of net carbs
 which may lead to reports questioning the accuracy of our calculations and reporting the amount of net carbs contained in certain of our products. Uncertainty among consumers as to the nutritional content or the ingredients used in our products
 regardless of the cause
 may have an adverse effect on our brands
 business
Our ability to compete effectively depends in part upon protection of our rights in trademarks
 trade dress
 copyrights and other intellectual property rights we own or license. Our use of contractual provisions
 confidentiality procedures and agreements
 and trademark
 copyright
 unfair competition
 trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. We may not be able to preclude third parties from using our intellectual property regarding food or beverage products
 and may not be able to leverage our branding beyond our current product offerings. In addition
 our trademark or other intellectual property applications may not always be granted. Third parties may oppose our intellectual property applications
 or otherwise challenge our use of trademarks or other intellectual property. Third parties may infringe
 misappropriate
 or otherwise violate our intellectual property. Changes in applicable laws could lessen or remove the current legal protections available for intellectual property. Any legal action we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful
 result in substantial costs and could divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns. A successful claim of trademark
 copyright or other intellectual property infringement
 misappropriation
 or other violation against us could prevent us from providing our products or services
 or could require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging if we cannot license such third-party intellectual property on reasonable terms. Certain of our intellectual property licenses have fixed terms
 and even for those that do not
 we cannot guarantee that all of our intellectual property licenses will remain in effect indefinitely. Termination of intellectual property licenses granted by or to us could cause the loss of profits generated under such licenses. Any of the foregoing outcomes could materially and adversely harm our business
Any inadequacy
 failure or interruption of our information technology systems may harm our ability to effectively operate our business
 and our business is subject to online security risks
We depend on various information technology systems
 including our recently implemented integrated enterprise resource planning system and certain other automated management and accounting systems. A failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control
 including natural disasters
 terrorist attacks
 telecommunications failures
 computer viruses
 hackers and other security issues. Despite safeguards we have implemented that are designed to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems
 we cannot be certain that our information technology systems are free from vulnerability to security breaches (especially as the sophistication of cyber-security threats continues to increase)
Unauthorized users who penetrate our information security systems could misappropriate proprietary
 employee
 or consumer information. As a result
 it may become necessary to expend additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against
 or to alleviate
 problems caused by unauthorized access. Data security breaches could cause damaged reputation with consumers and reduced demand for our products. Additional expenditures may not prove to be a timely remedy against breaches by unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security. Besides purposeful security breaches
 the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and
 in turn
A significant number of states require that consumers be notified if a security breach results in disclosing their personal financial account or other information. Additional states and governmental entities are considering such &#8220;notice&#8221; laws. In addition
 other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported. If we experience a security breach
 and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future
Except for limited information voluntarily submitted by users of our website
 we typically do not collect or store consumer data or personal information. However
 third-party providers
 including our licensees
 contract manufacturers
 e-commerce contractors and third-party sellers may do so. The website operations of such third parties may be affected by reliance on other third-party hardware and software providers
 technology changes
 risks related to the failure of computer systems through which these website operations are conducted
 telecommunications failures
 data security breaches and similar disruptions. If we or our third-party providers fail to maintain or protect our respective information technology systems and data integrity effectively
 fail to implement new systems
 and/or update or expand existing systems or fail to anticipate
 plan for or manage significant disruptions to systems involved in our operations
 we could lose existing customers
 have difficulty preventing
 detecting
 and controlling fraud
 have disputes with customers
 suppliers
 distributors or others
 and be subject to regulatory sanctions
 including sanctions stemming from violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 and as a result
If we cannot implement appropriate systems
 procedures and controls
 we may not be able to successfully offer our products
Our ability to successfully offer our products
 grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner requires an effective planning and management process and certain other automated management and accounting systems. We recently implemented an integrated enterprise resource planning system and certain other automated management and accounting systems. We periodically update our operations and financial systems
 procedures and controls; however; we still rely on certain manual processes and procedures that may not scale proportionately with our business growth. Our systems will continue to require automation
 modifications and improvements to respond to current and future changes in our business. Failure to implement promptly appropriate internal systems
 procedures and controls could materially and adversely affect our business
We believe that we maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However
 there are losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business
Loss of our key executive officers or other personnel
 or an inability to attract and retain such management and other personnel
Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills
 experience and efforts of our key executive officers. Losing the services of any of these executives could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects
 as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis
 if at all. Additionally
 we also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we fail to attract talented new employees
We may need additional capital in the future
We have historically relied upon cash generated by our operations to fund our operations and strategy. We may also need to access the debt and equity capital markets
 however
 these sources of financing may not be available on acceptable terms
 or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to several factors
 including market conditions
 our operating performance
 investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our outstanding debt. These factors may make the timing
 amount
 terms or conditions of additional financing unattractive to us. If we cannot generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital
We have incurred and will continue to incur significantly increased costs because of operating as a public company
We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal
 accounting
 insurance and other expenses because of being a public company. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Customer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the 
 and related rules implemented by the SEC
 have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. In addition
 rules that the SEC is implementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to require additional changes. Compliance with these and other similar laws
 rules and regulations
 including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&#8220;Section 404&#8221;)
 has and will continue to substantially increase expense
 including our legal and accounting costs
 and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Our internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support our increased reporting obligations
 and we may be unable to hire
 train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our limited experience or employees which could adversely affect our business if our internal infrastructure is inadequate to fulfill our public company obligations. These laws
 rules and regulations could also make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors
If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. In the future
 we may discover areas of our internal control over financial reporting that need improvement. Before the Business Combination
 we had not historically documented our internal controls. If we identify a control deficiency that rises to the level of a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting
 our ability to record
 process
 summarize and report financial information timely and accurately may be adversely affected and
 as a result
 our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition
 our internal financial and accounting team is leanly staffed
 which can lead to inefficiencies regarding segregation of duties. If we fail to properly and efficiently maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting
Our only significant asset is ownership of 100% of Atkins Intermediate Holdings
We have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the direct ownership of 100% of Atkins Intermediate Holdings
 LLC. We currently depend on&#160;Atkins Intermediate Holdings
 LLC for distributions
 loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay any dividends regarding our common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing our debt arrangements and future indebtedness of&#160;Atkins Intermediate Holdings
 LLC
 and the financial condition and operating requirements of&#160;Atkins Intermediate Holdings
 LLC
 may limit our ability to obtain funds in a timely manner from Atkins Intermediate Holdings
 LLC. The earnings from
 or other available assets of
&#160;Atkins Intermediate Holdings
 LLC may not be sufficient to pay dividends
 make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock
Our international operations expose us to regulatory
 economic
The international nature of our operations involves several risks
 including changes in U.S. and foreign regulations
 tariffs
 taxes and exchange controls
 economic downturns
 inflation and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate and our dependence on foreign personnel. Moreover
 although our products in our foreign operations typically mirror those in the United States
 consumers outside the United States may have different tastes
 preferences and nutritional approaches than U.S. consumers. Our international business is small compared to our U.S. business
 and as a result
Doing business outside the United States requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions
 which place restrictions on our operations
 trade practices
 partners and investment decisions. In particular
 our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations
 such as the FCPA or the Bribery Act
 export controls and economic sanctions programs
 including those administered by the OFAC and the EU. Because of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners
 we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. In addition
 the Bribery Act extends beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also applies to transactions with private persons. The provisions of the Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in several other respects
 including jurisdictional reach
 non-exemption of facilitation payments and
 potentially
Our continued expansion outside the United States
 including in developing countries
 and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide
 could increase the risk of FCPA
 OFAC
 Bribery Act or EU sanctions violations in the future. Violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations may cause reputational damage and are punishable by civil penalties
 including fines
 denial of export privileges
 injunctions
 asset seizures
 debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses
Finally
 our business could be negatively affected by changes in the U.S. and Canadian political environments
 in particular. We operate primarily in the U.S. and Canada and we ship a large number of products between the U.S. and Canada. Adverse changes to trade agreements
 import or export regulations
 customs duties or tariffs by either or both governments may have a negative effect on our business
Our international operations expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates
We source large quantities of our core ingredients from foreign suppliers
 and as a result
 any material upward movement in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore
 the substantial majority of our revenue is generated domestically
        Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;). The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future
 based on a variety of factors
 including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors
 government regulations
 litigation
 changes in earnings estimates by analysts
 fluctuations in quarterly operating results or general conditions in our industry and may be exacerbated by there having historically been limited trading volume in our common stock. Furthermore
 stock prices for many companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results. Those fluctuations and general economic
 political and market conditions
 such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services
We do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently
 investors may need to rely on sales of their shares of common stock after the price has appreciated
 which may never occur
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that

 the doctrine of &#8220;corporate opportunity&#8221; does not apply with respect to the directors
 officers
 employees or representatives of Conyers Park Sponsor
) Centerview Capital Holdings LLC (&#8220;Centerview Capital&#8221;) and Centerview Partners and their respective affiliates
The doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources
 acquire an interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in which the corporation has a present or expectancy interest
 unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to pursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers
 directors or other fiduciaries from personally benefiting from opportunities that belong to the corporation. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that
 to the extent allowed by law
 the doctrine of &#8220;corporate opportunity&#8221; does not apply with respect to the directors
 officers
 employees or representatives of Conyers Park Sponsor
 Centerview Capital and Centerview Partners and their respective affiliates. The doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of our directors or officers with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered in writing to such person solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer and such opportunity is one which they are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. Therefore
 except as provided above
 these parties have no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us
 and have the right to either hold any corporate opportunity for their (and their affiliates&#8217;) own account and benefit or to recommend
As a result
 certain of our stockholders
 directors and their respective affiliates are not prohibited from operating or investing in competing businesses. We therefore may find ourselves in competition with certain of our stockholders
 directors or their respective affiliates
 and we may not know of
 or be able to pursue
 transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly
 we may lose a corporate opportunity or suffer competitive harm
If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us
 our business
 or our market
 or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely
The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us
 our business
 our market or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts may not publish or may cease publishing research on us. If securities or industry analysts cease coverage
 our stock price and trading volume may be negatively affected. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely
 or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors
 the price of our common stock may decline. If any analysts ceased coverage
 or fail to regularly publish reports on our business
 we could lose visibility in the financial markets
There may be future sales or other dilution of the Company's equity
We are not generally restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock
 or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for
 or that represent the right to receive
 shares of common stock. Issuing any additional shares of common stock or preferred shares or securities convertible into
 exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive shares of common stock or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Additionally

 additional shares of our common stock will be issued
The market price of our common stock could decline because of sales of our common stock made in the future or the perception that such sales could occur. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control
 we cannot predict or estimate the amount
 timing or nature of future offerings

The Company's board of directors may issue

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes a provision for the issuance of preferred stock
 which may be issued in one or more series
 with each series containing such rights and preferences as the board of directors may determine from time to time
 without prior notice to or approval of stockholders. Among others
 such rights and preferences might include the rights to dividends
 liquidation preferences and rights to convert into common stock. The rights and preferences of any such series of preferred stock

Anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws
 and provisions of Delaware law
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law
no cumulative voting in the election of directors
the right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation
 death
 or removal of a director in certain circumstances
the ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares
 including preferences and voting rights
 without stockholder approval
a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent
a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting
the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may be called only by the board of directors

The Simply Good Foods Company is a consumer packaged food and beverage company that aims to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient
 innovative
 great-tasting
 better-for-you snacks and meal replacements. Our nutritious snacking platform consists of the following core brands that specialize in providing products for consumers that follow certain nutritional philosophies
 dietary approaches and/or health-and-wellness trends: Atkins&#174; for those following a low-carb lifestyle; and Quest&#174; for consumers seeking to partner with a brand that makes the foods they crave work for them
 not against them
 through a variety of protein-rich foods and beverages that also limit sugars and simple carbs.&#160;We distribute our products in major retail channels
 primarily in North America
 including grocery
 club and mass merchandise
 as well as through e-commerce
 convenience
 specialty and other channels. Our portfolio of nutritious snacking brands gives us a strong platform with which to introduce new products
 expand distribution
To that end
 in November 2019
 we completed the acquisition of Quest Nutrition
 LLC (&#8220;Quest&#8221;)
 a healthy lifestyle food company

In December 2019
 a novel coronavirus disease
 or COVID-19
 was reported and in January 2020
 the World Health Organization
 or WHO
 declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28
 2020
 the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries
 and on March 11
 2020
 the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. On March 27
 2020
 the Coronavirus Aid
 Relief
 and Economic Security (&#8220;CARES&#8221;) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act provided a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended to address the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic
 including tax relief and government loans
 grants and investments. Additionally
 various federal
 state and local government-imposed movement restrictions and initiatives have been implemented to reduce the global transmission of COVID-19
 including reduced or eliminated food services
 the closure of retailing establishments
During the third quarter of 2020
 we actively engaged with the various elements of our value chain
 including our customers
 contract manufacturers
 and logistics and transportation providers
 to meet demand for our products and to remain informed of any challenges within our value chain. Given the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the initial surge in consumption
 we increased finished goods inventory of some of our key products. Based on information available to us as of the end of our fiscal year
 we believe we will be able to deliver our products to meet customer orders on a timely basis
 and therefore
to meet consumer meal replacement and snacking needs for the foreseeable future. We continue to monitor customer and consumer demand
Additionally
 in March 2020
 we borrowed $25.0 million under our $75.0 million revolving credit facility
 as a precautionary measure to ensure ample financial flexibility in light of the spread of COVID-19 and the initial surge in demand. The Company used the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility to meet initial elevated customer orders
 build finished goods inventory of some of our high velocity items
 to support working capital and to support general corporate purposes. Based on that assessment of our sources of liquidity and capital
 which included strong realized cash flow from operations and no material collectability concerns regarding our customers' ability to pay
We implemented remote work arrangements and restricted business travel in mid-March
 and to date
 these arrangements have not materially affected our ability to maintain our business operations
 including the operation of financial reporting systems
 internal control over financial reporting
 and disclosure controls and procedures. We believe our lean infrastructure

 were affected by changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior due to COVID-19. After the brief pantry loading period in mid-March 2020
 the nutritional snacking category saw a marked decrease in shopping trips (particularly in the mass channel) and fewer usage occasions. This affected our portable and convenient on-the-go products
 especially the nutrition and protein bar portion of our business for both our Atkins and Quest brands. As home confinement restrictions began to ease
During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020
 the improvement in category trends plateaued. While our Quest brand has outperformed its portion of the nutritious snaking segment
 the performance of our Atkins brand
 which is part of the weight management portion of the market
 has remained slower due to the temporary softer interest in weight management for consumers
Based on the duration and severity of economic effects from the COVID-19 pandemic
 including but not limited to stock market volatility
 the potential for (i) continued increased rates of reported cases of COVID-19
 (ii)&#160;unexpected supply chain disruptions
 (iii) changes to customer operations
 (iv) continued or additional changes in consumer purchasing and consumption behavior beyond those evidenced to date
 and (v) the closure of customer establishments

fifty-two week period ended August 25
 2018
 
Following the Acquisition of Quest
 our operations are organized into two operating segments
 Atkins and Quest
 which are aggregated into one reporting segment
 due to similar financial
 economic and operating characteristics. The operating segments are also similar in the following areas: (a) the nature of the products; (b) the nature of the production processes; (c) the methods used to distribute products to customers
 (d) the type of customer for the products
Net sales consists primarily of product sales less the cost of promotional activities
 slotting fees and other sales credits and adjustments
Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs we pay to our contract manufacturing partners to produce the products sold. These costs include the purchase of raw ingredients
 packaging
 shipping and handling
 warehousing
 depreciation of warehouse equipment
Operating expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing
 general and administrative
 depreciation and amortization
 Selling and marketing expenses are comprised of broker commissions
 customer marketing
 General and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support our business
 including employee salaries
 professional services
 integration costs
 restructuring costs
 Business transaction costs are comprised of legal
 due diligence
 consulting and accounting firm expenses associated with the process of actively pursuing potential and completed business combinations
In assessing the performance of our business
 we consider a number of key performance indicators used by management and typically used by our competitors
 including the non-GAAP measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share.&#160;Because not all companies use identical calculations

 driven by solid e-commerce sales growth
 partially offset by higher trade promotions
 the approximately 2.0% of additional contribution to full year sales growth related to the fifty-third week in the prior year period

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). Simply Good Foods defines Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest
 tax
 depreciation
 and amortization) as net income before interest income
 interest expense
 income tax expense
 depreciation and amortization with further adjustments to exclude the following items: business transaction costs
 stock-based compensation expense
 inventory step-up

Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of our revenue
 expenses
 assets and liabilities are not based on estimates
 there are certain accounting principles that requires management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments
 estimates and uncertainties
 which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in 
 
 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing; however
 the following discussion pertains to accounting policies we believe are most critical to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and that require significant
 difficult
 subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies
 which may affect the comparability of our financial condition
We recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with its customer are satisfied. We have determined that fulfilling and delivering products is a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation and the customer has obtained control of the products. This generally occurs when the product is delivered to or picked up by our customer based on applicable shipping terms
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for fulfilled product orders
 including estimates of variable consideration. The most common forms of variable consideration include trade promotions
 such as consumer incentives
 coupon redemptions and other marketing activities
 allowances for unsaleable product
 and any additional amounts where a distinct good or service cannot be identified or the value cannot be reasonably estimated. Estimates of variable consideration are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities
 market data from IRI
 and our best estimate of current activity. Revisions can include changes for consideration paid to customers that lack sufficient evidence to support a distinct good or service assertion
 or for which a reasonably estimable fair value cannot be determined
Although some payment terms may be more extended
 the majority of our payment terms are less than 60 days. As a result
While our revenue recognition does not involve significant judgment
We offer trade promotions through various programs to customers and consumers. Trade promotions include discounts
 rebates
 slotting and other marketing activities. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying sale. The recognition of trade promotions requires management to make estimates regarding the volume of incentive that will be redeemed and their total cost. These estimates are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities
 market data from IRI

 pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
 we completed the Acquisition of Quest for a cash purchase price of approximately 
 subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The Acquisition of Quest was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 805
&#160;Business Combinations&#160;(&#8220;ASC 805&#8221;)
 whereby the results of operations
 including the revenues and earnings of Quest
 are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition. Additionally
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their fair values based on widely accepted valuation techniques in accordance with ASC Topic 820
&#160;Fair Value Measurements
 as of the closing date. Significant judgment is required to determine the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets. The process for estimating fair values requires the use of significant estimates
 assumptions and judgments
 including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. ASC 805 establishes a measurement period to provide companies with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of acquisition date. We expect to complete the final fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as soon as practicable within the measurement period
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized
 but instead are tested for impairment at least annually
We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using either a qualitative or quantitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units are less than their carrying amounts. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions
 industry-specific and company-specific considerations
 legal and regulatory environments
 and historical performance. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value
 a quantitative assessment is performed. Otherwise
 no further assessment is required. The quantitative approach compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount
 including goodwill. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit
For fiscal year 2020
 we elected to perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The inputs and assumptions used require considerable management judgment and are based on expectations of future operating performance. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020
 we determined there were indicators of impairment related to the SimplyProtein brand intangible asset. Therefore
 we performed a quantitative assessment of our brand intangible asset
 which indicated the fair value exceeded the carrying value

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax
Income taxes include federal
 state and foreign taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. Significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate

We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowing based on a variable interest rate. Derivative financial instruments
 such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements
 may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from our variable rate debt obligations that are expected to remain outstanding. Interest rate changes do not affect the market value of such debt
 but could affect the amount of our interest payments
 and accordingly
 our future earnings and cash flows
 assuming other factors are held constant. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]





November 7
 2019
 pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
 the Company completed the Acquisition of Quest for a cash purchase price of approximately 
 subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The Acquisition of Quest was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 805
&#160;Business Combinations&#160;(&#8220;ASC 805&#8221;)
 whereby the results of operations
 including the revenues and earnings of Quest
 are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition. Additionally
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their fair values based on widely accepted valuation techniques in accordance with ASC Topic 820
&#160;Fair Value Measurements
 as of the closing date. The process for estimating fair values requires the use of significant estimates
 assumptions and judgments
 including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. ASC 805 establishes a measurement period to provide the Company with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of acquisition date. The Company expects to complete the final fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as soon as practicable within the measurement period
Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities are valued based upon observable and non-observable inputs. Valuations using Level 1 inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs utilize significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date
 consist of cash on hand
 deposits available on demand and other short-term
 highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are carried at cost
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable
 consists primarily of trade receivables
 net of allowances for doubtful accounts
 returns and trade promotions. The Company sells its products for cash or on credit terms
 which are established in accordance with local and industry practices and typically require payment within 30 days of delivery and may allow discounts for early payment. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of outstanding receivables

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Intangible assets
 primarily include brands and trademarks with indefinite lives and customer-related relationships with finite lives. Upon acquisition
 the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities
 including customer-related intangible assets and trademarks
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually
 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company conducts its annual impairment tests at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units are less than their carrying amounts. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions
 industry-specific and company-specific considerations
 legal and regulatory environments
 and historical performance. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value
 a quantitative assessment is performed. Otherwise
 no further assessment is required. The quantitative approach compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount
 including goodwill. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit
For fiscal year 2020
 the Company elected to perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020
 the Company determined there were indicators of impairment related to the SimplyProtein brand intangible asset. Therefore
 the Company performed a quantitative assessment of its brand intangible asset
 which indicated the fair value exceeded the carrying value
fifty-two week period ended August 29
fifty-two week period ended August 29
. Additionally
 for fiscal year 2019
fifty-three week period ended August 31
. The qualitative assessments determined that it was more likely than not the reporting unit
 brands and trademarks had a fair value in excess of their carrying value. Accordingly
 no further impairment assessment was necessary
fifty-two week period ended August 25
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews for impairment indicators of finite-lived intangibles and other long-lived assets as described in the &#8220;Property and Equipment
Income taxes include federal
Contracts are evaluated to determine whether they contain a lease at inception. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC Topic 842
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.&#160;The majority of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore
The Company monitors for triggering events or conditions that require a reassessment of its leases. When the reassessment requires a re-measurement of the lease liability
 a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. Additionally
 the Company reviewed for impairment indicators of its right-of-use assets and other long-lived assets as described in the &#8220;Property and Equipment
The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with its customer are satisfied. The Company has determined that fulfilling and delivering products is a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation and the customer has obtained control of the products. This generally occurs when the product is delivered to or picked up by the customer based on applicable shipping terms
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for fulfilled product orders
 including estimates of variable consideration. The most common forms of variable consideration include trade promotions
 such as consumer incentives
coupon redemptions and other marketing activities
 allowances for unsaleable product
August&#160;29
August&#160;31

 the allowance for trade promotions was 
Estimates of variable consideration are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities
 market data from IRI
 and the Company&#8217;s best estimate of current activity. The Company reviews these estimates regularly and makes revisions as necessary. Revisions can include changes for consideration paid to customers that lack sufficient evidence to support a distinct good or service assertion
 or for which a reasonably estimable fair value cannot be determined
The Company provides standard assurance type warranties that its products will comply with all agreed-upon specifications. No services beyond an assurance type warranty are provided to customers. While customers generally have a right to return defective or non-conforming products
 past experience has demonstrated that product returns have been immaterial. Customer remedies for defective or non-conforming products may include a refund or exchange. As a result
 the right of return is estimated and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time of sale
The Company's customer contracts identify product quantity
 price and payment terms. Payment terms are granted consistent with industry standards. Although some payment terms may be more extended
 the majority of the Company's payment terms are less than 60 days. As a result
Accounts receivable
The Company utilizes third-party contract manufacturers for the manufacture of its products. The Company has evaluated whether the it is the principal or agent in these relationships. The Company has determined that it is the principal in all cases
 as it maintains the responsibility for fulfillment
In accordance with ASC Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 the Company has elected the practical expedient to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract
 because the amortization period would be less than one year
 and the practical expedient for shipping and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver products to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities
 rather than a promised service
 and as such are included in 
Costs of goods sold represent costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of the Company's products. Such costs include raw materials
 co-manufacturing costs

In June 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2016-13
&#160;Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)
 which modifies disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing
 modifying or adding certain disclosures. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13
&#160;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)
 which modifies disclosure requirements on fair value measurements of Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 820. This ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
In December 2019
 the FASB issued ASU 2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes
 which amends the existing guidance relating to the accounting for income taxes. This ASU is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of accounting for income taxes and to improve the consistent application of U.S. GAAP for other areas of accounting for income taxes by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2021
In March 2020
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04
 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)
 Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
 which provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities as of March 12
 2020 through December 31
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
&#160;Leases (Topic 842).&#160;The standard requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
&#160;Leases (Topic 842):&#160;Targeted Improvements. ASU 2018-11 provides entities another option for transition
On September 1
 2019
 the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 using the alternative transition method under ASU No. 2018-11
 which permits application of the new lease guidance at the beginning of the period of adoption
 with comparative periods continuing to be reporting under Topic 840. Upon adoption
Other long-term assets
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities
Other long-term liabilities
Property and equipment
 net
Current maturities of long term debt
. Following the Acquisition of Quest
 the Company recorded the following amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the closing date on November&#160;7
Other long-term assets
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities
The guidance provided a number of optional practical expedients in adoption. The Company elected to adopt the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the standard
 which among other things
 permits it to not reassess prior conclusions about lease identification
 lease classification and initial direct costs under the new standard. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements
 the latter not being applicable. Additionally
 the Company elected to include both lease and non-lease components as a single component for all asset classes in which the Company is the lessee. For additional information regarding leases
In June 2018
 the FASB issued&#160;ASU&#160;No. 2018-07
&#160;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15
&#160;Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)
 Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract
 which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company adopted this ASU as of the first day of fiscal 2020. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

 of the consolidated financial statements. The fair value measurement of the assets and liabilities was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information
 including estimated future cash flows and market comparable data and companies. The fair values of the intangible assets were estimated using inputs primarily from the income approach and the with/without method
 which estimates the value using the cash flow impact in a hypothetical scenario where the customer relationships are not in place. The significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets include the estimated life the asset will contribute to cash flows
 profitability
(3) Primarily as a result of the fair value attributable to the identifiable intangible assets
The final determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is expected to be completed in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. Since the initial preliminary estimates reported in the first fiscal quarter of 2020
 the Company has updated certain amounts reflected in the preliminary purchase price allocation
 as summarized in the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as set forth above. Specifically
 the carrying amount of the intangible assets
 as a result of valuation adjustments related to the Company's finalization of tax attributes
. Additionally
 accounts receivable
 due to fair value measurement period adjustments
 and the carrying amount of property and equipment
 related to net working capital adjustments discussed above
Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The final fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be completed prior to one year from the transaction completion

Pro forma financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of operations of the combined business that would have been reported had the Acquisition of Quest been completed at the beginning of the fiscal year 2019
This unaudited pro forma combined financial information is prepared based on Article 11 of Regulation S-X period end guidance. The Company and the legacy Quest entity have different fiscal year ends
 with Simply Good Foods&#8217; fiscal year being the last Saturday of August while the legacy Quest business fiscal year end was December 31. Because the year ends differ by more than 93 days
fifty-three week period ended August 31

 the Company added Quest&#8217;s unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30
 2019 to Quest's unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended December 31
 2018
 which was derived by deducting the historical unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30

 from the unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31
In addition to the above period end adjustments
 the pro forma results include certain adjustments

November 7
 2019
 pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
 the Company completed the Acquisition of Quest for a cash purchase price of approximately 
 subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The Acquisition of Quest was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 805
&#160;Business Combinations&#160;(&#8220;ASC 805&#8221;)
 whereby the results of operations
 including the revenues and earnings of Quest
 are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition. Additionally
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their fair values based on widely accepted valuation techniques in accordance with ASC Topic 820
&#160;Fair Value Measurements
 as of the closing date. The process for estimating fair values requires the use of significant estimates
 assumptions and judgments
 including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. ASC 805 establishes a measurement period to provide the Company with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of acquisition date. The Company expects to complete the final fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as soon as practicable within the measurement period
 but not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.




Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities are valued based upon observable and non-observable inputs. Valuations using Level 1 inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs utilize significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date
 other than quoted prices included in Level 1. Valuations using Level 3 inputs are based on significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and require significant judgment. There were no significant transfers between levels during any period presented.

Accounts receivable
 consists primarily of trade receivables

 returns and trade promotions. The Company sells its products for cash or on credit terms
 which are established in accordance with local and industry practices and typically require payment within 30 days of delivery and may allow discounts for early payment. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of outstanding receivables

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 Net
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Intangible assets
 primarily include brands and trademarks with indefinite lives and customer-related relationships with finite lives. Upon acquisition
 the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities
 including customer-related intangible assets and trademarks
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually
 or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company conducts its annual impairment tests at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units are less than their carrying amounts. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions
 industry-specific and company-specific considerations
 legal and regulatory environments
 and historical performance. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value
 a quantitative assessment is performed. Otherwise
 no further assessment is required. The quantitative approach compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount
 including goodwill. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit
For fiscal year 2020
 the Company elected to perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020
 the Company determined there were indicators of impairment related to the SimplyProtein brand intangible asset. Therefore
 the Company performed a quantitative assessment of its brand intangible asset
 which indicated the fair value exceeded the carrying value

fifty-two week period ended August 29
. Additionally
 for fiscal year 2019
fifty-three week period ended August 31
. The qualitative assessments determined that it was more likely than not the reporting unit
 brands and trademarks had a fair value in excess of their carrying value. Accordingly
 no further impairment assessment was necessary
fifty-two week period ended August 25
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews for impairment indicators of finite-lived intangibles and other long-lived assets as described in the &#8220;Property and Equipment
 Net&#8221; significant accounting policy.









Income taxes include federal
 state and foreign taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement balances and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the fiscal year that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.




Contracts are evaluated to determine whether they contain a lease at inception. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC Topic 842
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.&#160;The majority of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore
The Company monitors for triggering events or conditions that require a reassessment of its leases. When the reassessment requires a re-measurement of the lease liability
 a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. Additionally
 the Company reviewed for impairment indicators of its right-of-use assets and other long-lived assets as described in the &#8220;Property and Equipment
 Net&#8221; significant accounting policy.




The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with its customer are satisfied. The Company has determined that fulfilling and delivering products is a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation and the customer has obtained control of the products. This generally occurs when the product is delivered to or picked up by the customer based on applicable shipping terms
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for fulfilled product orders
 including estimates of variable consideration. The most common forms of variable consideration include trade promotions
 such as consumer incentives
coupon redemptions and other marketing activities
 allowances for unsaleable product
August&#160;29

 the allowance for trade promotions was 
Estimates of variable consideration are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities
 market data from IRI
 and the Company&#8217;s best estimate of current activity. The Company reviews these estimates regularly and makes revisions as necessary. Revisions can include changes for consideration paid to customers that lack sufficient evidence to support a distinct good or service assertion
 or for which a reasonably estimable fair value cannot be determined
The Company provides standard assurance type warranties that its products will comply with all agreed-upon specifications. No services beyond an assurance type warranty are provided to customers. While customers generally have a right to return defective or non-conforming products
 past experience has demonstrated that product returns have been immaterial. Customer remedies for defective or non-conforming products may include a refund or exchange. As a result
 the right of return is estimated and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time of sale
The Company's customer contracts identify product quantity
 price and payment terms. Payment terms are granted consistent with industry standards. Although some payment terms may be more extended
 the majority of the Company's payment terms are less than 60 days. As a result
Accounts receivable
The Company utilizes third-party contract manufacturers for the manufacture of its products. The Company has evaluated whether the it is the principal or agent in these relationships. The Company has determined that it is the principal in all cases
 as it maintains the responsibility for fulfillment
In accordance with ASC Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 the Company has elected the practical expedient to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract
 because the amortization period would be less than one year
 and the practical expedient for shipping and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver products to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities
 rather than a promised service
 and as such are included in 
 




Costs of goods sold represent costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of the Company's products. Such costs include raw materials
 co-manufacturing costs
 packaging
 shipping and handling
 third-party distribution and depreciation of distribution center equipment and leasehold improvements.

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
&#160;Leases (Topic 842).&#160;The standard requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet.

The estimated amount of dividends to be paid to holders of the underlying shares (expected dividends) over the option's term. Dividends are taken into account because payment of dividends to shareholders reduces the fair value of the underlying shares
 and option holders generally do not receive dividends.

























































The estimated measure of the maximum percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
