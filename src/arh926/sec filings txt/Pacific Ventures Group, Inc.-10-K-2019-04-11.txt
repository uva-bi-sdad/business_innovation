Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K (this &ldquo;Annual Report&rdquo;) contains forward-looking statements. The SEC encourages companies
to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company&rsquo;s future prospects and make informed
investment decisions. This Annual Report and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking
statements that set out anticipated results based on management&rsquo;s plans and assumptions regarding future events or performance.
We have tried
 wherever possible
 to identify such statements by using words such as &ldquo;anticipate
&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate
&rdquo;
&ldquo;expect
&rdquo; &ldquo;project
&rdquo; &ldquo;intend
&rdquo; &ldquo;plan
&rdquo; &ldquo;believe
&rdquo; &ldquo;will&rdquo;
and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular
 these include
statements relating to future actions
 future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts
 expenses
 the outcome
of contingencies
 such as legal proceedings
 and financial results.

We
caution that the factors described herein and other factors could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition
to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we make and that investors should not place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Further
 any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such
statement is made
 and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances.
New factors emerge from time to time
 and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further
 we cannot assess
the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor
 or combination of factors
 may
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Use
of Market and Industry Data

This
Annual Report includes market and industry data that we have obtained from third-party sources
 including industry publications
as well as industry data prepared by our management on the basis of its knowledge of and experience in the industries in which
we operate (including our management&rsquo;s estimates and assumptions relating to such industries based on that knowledge). Management
has developed its knowledge of such industries through its experience and participation in these industries. While our management
believes the third-party sources referred to in this Annual Report are reliable
 neither we nor our management have independently
verified any of the data from such sources referred to in this Annual Report or ascertained the underlying economic assumptions
relied upon by such sources. Furthermore

ITEM
    1. 
    


Unless
the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise stated
 references to &ldquo;our Company
&rdquo; &ldquo;Pacific Ventures
&rdquo;
&ldquo;PACV
&rdquo; &ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;us
&rdquo; &ldquo;our&rdquo; and similar references refer to Pacific Ventures Group
Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.



Pacific
Ventures was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3
 1986
 under the name AOA Corporation. On November
12
 1991
 the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group
 Inc. On October 22
 2012
 the Company changed its name to Pacific
Ventures Group
 Inc.

The
current structure of Pacific Ventures resulted from a share exchange with Sn&ouml;bar Holdings
 Inc. (&ldquo;Sn&ouml;bar&rdquo;)
which was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. On August 14
 2015
 Pacific Ventures and its stockholders entered
into a share exchange agreement (the &ldquo;Share Exchange Agreement&rdquo;) with Sn&ouml;bar Holdings
 Inc. (&ldquo;Sn&ouml;bar
Holdings&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings&rsquo;
Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22
500
000 restricted shares of Pacific Ventures&rsquo; common stock
 while simultaneously
issuing 2
500
000 shares of Pacific Ventures&rsquo; restricted common stock to certain other persons
 including for services provided
and to a former officer of the Company (the &ldquo;Share Exchange&rdquo;).As the result of the Share Exchange
 Sn&ouml;bar Holdings.
became Pacific Venture&rsquo;s wholly owned operating subsidiary and the business of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings became the Company&rsquo;s
sole business operations
 and Sn&ouml;bar Holdings&rsquo; majority owned subsidiary
 MAS Global Distributors
 Inc.
 a California
corporation (&ldquo;MGD&rdquo;)
became indirect subsidiary of Pacific Ventures.

Prior
to the Share Exchange
 the Company operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries
 marketed and underwrote
specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace. However
 in 1997
 after selling several
of its divisions
 the Company&rsquo;s remaining insurance operations were placed into receivership and the Company ceased operating
its insurance business.

Since
the Share Exchange represented a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations
 the business operations
changed to that of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are solely that of
Sn&ouml;bar Holdings and its affiliates and subsidiaries comprising of Sn&ouml;bar Trust 
 IPIC
 and MGD.

Sn&ouml;bar
Holdings was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7
 2013. Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary
of Sn&ouml;bar Trust
 a California trust (&ldquo;Trust&rdquo;)
 which was formed in June 1
 2013. The current trustee that holds
legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge
 who is the father of Shannon Masjedi
 who is the Company&rsquo;s President
 Chief
Executive Officer
 Interim Chief Financial Officer
 Treasurer
 Secretary and majority stockholder . The Trust owns 100% of the
shares of International Production Impex Corporation
 a California corporation (&ldquo;IPIC&rdquo;)
 which was formed on August
2
 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops
 and holds all of the rights to the liquor
licenses to sell such products and trade names &ldquo;Sn&ouml;Bar&rdquo;. As such
 the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC
and its liquor licenses
 permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors
 with all income
 expense
 gains and losses rolling
up to the Trust
 of which Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is the sole beneficiary. Sn&ouml;bar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of
MAS Global Distributors
 Inc.
 a California corporation (&ldquo;MGD&rdquo;). MGD is in the business of selling and leasing freezers
and providing marketing services. As a result of the foregoing
 Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of all assets
liabilities and any income received from the business of the Trust and IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD.

The
Trust and IPIC are considered variable interest entities (&ldquo;VIEs&rdquo;) and Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is identified as the primary
beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification(&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;)
810
 Sn&ouml;bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment
of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings&rsquo; management is that Sn&ouml;bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE&rsquo;s activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC)
 and the obligation to
absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that
could potentially be significant to the VIE&rsquo;s economic performance
 it was therefore concluded by management that Sn&ouml;bar
Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such
 the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements
of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings since the inception of the Trust
 in the case of the Trust
 and since the inception of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings
in the case of IPIC.

On
June 12
 2017
 the Company
 entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire Healthy Foods Markets LLC
 a Carson
 California
based healthy food and grocery retailer. The contemplated acquisition of the business was aimed at creating a fulfillment center
for the Sn &ouml; bar products and to create additional and immediate revenue and exposure for the Company. However
 after further
consideration and additional due diligence review of the target businesses
 the Company determined to rescind the transaction
and the related purchase agreements.

On
May 1
 2018
 Royalty Foods Partners
 LLC &ndash; a Florida Limited Liability Corporation and a subsidiary of Pacific Ventures
Group
 Inc. &ndash; completed an asset acquisition of San Diego Farmers Outlet
 Inc. (SDFO)
 a California Corporation. San Diego
Farmers Outlet was started in over thirty-five years ago to provide primarily restaurants customers in southern California&rsquo;s
three largest counties with quality food and produce
 and does business under the names of Farmers Outlet and San Diego
Farmers Outlet.

Our
principal executive office is located at 117 West 9th Street
 Suite 316

Description
of Operations of Pacific Ventures Group
 Inc.



On
May 1
 2018
 Royalty Foods Partners
 LLC &ndash; a Florida Limited Liability Corporation and a subsidiary of Pacific Ventures
Group
 Inc. &ndash; completed an asset acquisition of San Diego Farmers Outlet
 Inc. (SDFO)
 a California Corporation. San Diego
Farmers Outlet was started in over thirty-five years ago to provide primarily restaurants customers in southern California&rsquo;s
three largest counties with quality food and produce
 and does business under the name of Farmers Outlet and San Diego Farmers
Outlet.

Farmers
Outlet provides a wide array of products to serve customers of all types. However
 they do have a niche in providing fresh produce
and food products. Farmers Outlet provides specialty produce that the larger distributors do not carry on a daily basis. Unlike
some larger distributors who make their customers receive products on a day and time convenient to the distributor
 Farmers Outlet
delivers daily and pays attention to what the customer wants. Farmers Outlet added products to meet the needs of restaurants
Hotels
 Clubs and bars
 Resorts
 food trucks and caterers. Free delivery was added to demonstrate that Farmers Outlet had customers
interest first in mind.

Since
the acquisition
 SDFO has increased sales of its wholesale business
 and still plan on expanding our current delivery territory
from 25 miles to a 40-mile radius. SDFO is also in the process of obtaining new delivery trucks to add to the current fleet of
trucks. The Company has begun marketing to new restaurants in the area
 most notably Asian and Italian restaurants
 and have let
restaurants know that SDFO can deliver the finest produce in market.

SDFO
installed new signage around the retail market
 added additional landscaping to enhance the appearance of the market
 and purchased
a new Point of Sale system to improve efficiency and ordering processes.

The
Company will continue to evaluate its projected expenditures relative to its available cash and to seek additional means of financing
in order to satisfy the Company&rsquo;s working capital and other cash requirements.

Market
and Strategy

SDFO
covers a large market area servicing Los Angeles
 Orange County and San Diego
 which we have estimated to be a $2.5 billion addressable
market.

Unlike
some larger distributors who make their customers receive products on a day and time convenient to the distributor
 SDFO delivers
daily and pays attention to what the customer wants. Farmers Outlet added products to meet the needs of restaurants
 Hotels

Farmers
Outlet provides a wide array of products to serve customers of all types. However

and food products. Farmers Outlet provides specialty produce that the larger distributors do not carry on a daily basis.

Farmers
Outlet covers a large market area servicing Los Angeles
 Orange County and San Diego
 which we have estimated to be a $2.5 billion
addressable market. Farmers Outlet currently services the San Diego territory and has over 125 active customers
 and no customer
represents more than five percent of Farmers Outlet gross revenues.

The
company services customers in high
 middle and low-income communities with a specialty in providing food and fresh produce to
customers serving small to medium size restaurants of all nationalities
 including Chinese
 Korean
 Mexican
 American
 Japanese
and Thai.

Pacific
Ventures intends to expand its business through the acquisition of other food manufacturing and distribution companies that serve
the Los Angeles
 Orange County and San Diego area
 thereby combining and expanding upon a combined customer base with a expanding
range of products and services.

Pacific
Ventures will continue to market its Sn&ouml;Bar product line
 which include proprietary premium ice cream and sorbets that are
distilled spirit cocktails containing up to 15% quality liqueurs and liquors. Currently
 there are four flavors available: Brandy
Alexander; Brandy Alexander with chocolate chips; Grasshopper; and Pink Squirrel. There are also numerous different liquor ice
cream flavors in development in classic ice cream drink styles such as Coffee Liqueur Ice Cream
 Pi&ntilde;a Colada Sorbet
 Sherry
Ice Cream
 and Strawberry Margarita Sorbet. Pacific Ventures is establishing a new production relationship with a wholesale frozen
food co-packing company that can meet our volume production and HAACP quality control requirements.



IPIC
sells the Sn&ouml;Bar products under a number of trademarks
 brand names and trade names that are important to its continued success.
The Sn&ouml;Bar brand is fully trademarked within the United States. IPIC&rsquo;s business could be adversely affected by the
loss of any major brand or by material infringement of its intellectual property rights. The Sn&ouml;Bar products are also subject
to intellectual property risks because existing trademark laws offer only limited protection
 and the laws of some countries in
which the Sn&ouml;Bar products are or may be developed
 manufactured or sold may not fully protect the Sn&ouml;Bar products from
infringement by others.



As
of December 31
 2018
 Pacific Ventures comprised five (5) employees who managed the affairs of the parent corporation and the
operations of its subsidiaries. On an as needed basis
 the Company hires independent contractors to perform specific tasks related
to the Company&rsquo;s business interests.

RISK
    FACTORS


An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the
other information in this report before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties
develop into actual events
 our business
 results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In those
cases
 the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks
Relating to Our Business and Industry

We
are seeking to market and advertise alcohol infused frozen products
 and may not be able to accomplish our goal.

A
key feature of our growth strategy is to engage in the marketing and advertising of alcohol infused frozen products. Doing so
presents significant challenges and subjects our business to significant risks. For example
 we face substantial competition in
these areas
 and do not have as extensive a history of operating in these areas as some of our competitors. If we are unsuccessful
in marketing and advertising alcohol infused frozen products
 our ability to grow our business could be significantly limited.

The
alcohol and dessert industries are highly competitive and if we are unable to compete successfully
 our business will be harmed.

The
alcoholic beverage industry and the dessert industry are extremely competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully against
current or future competitors in such industries
 our revenues
 margins and market share could be adversely affected
 any of which
could significantly harm our business
 operating results or financial condition.

Our
success depends on certain key personnel.

Our
performance to date has been and will continue to be largely dependent on the talents
 efforts and performance of our senior management
and key technical personnel. It is anticipated that our executive officers will enter into employment agreements. However
 while
it is customary to use employment agreements as a method of retaining the services of key personnel
 these agreements do not guarantee
us the continued services of such employees. In addition
 we have not entered into employment agreements with most of our key
personnel. The loss of our executive officers or our other key personnel
 particularly with little or no notice
 could cause delays
on projects and could have an adverse impact on our client and industry relationships
 our business
 operating results or financial
condition.

We
rely on highly skilled and qualified personnel
 and if we are unable to continue to attract and retain such qualified personnel
it will adversely affect our businesses.

Our
success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify
 attract
 hire
 train and retain qualified creative
 technical
and managerial personnel. We expect competition for personnel with the specialized creative and technical skills needed to create
our products and provide our services will continue to intensify. We often hire individuals on a project-by-project basis
 and
individuals who work on one or more projects for us may not be available to work on future projects. If we have difficulty identifying
attracting
 hiring
 training and retaining such qualified personnel
 or incur significant costs in order to do so
 our business
and financial results could be negatively impacted.

Risks
associated with commodity price volatility and energy availability could adversely affect our business.

We
are exposed to risks associated with commodity price volatility arising from supply conditions
 geopolitical and economic variables
weather
 and other unpredictable external factors. We buy commodities such as fresh produce for the production
 packaging and
distribution of our products. Availability
 increases and volatility in the prices of these commodities
 as well as products sourced
from third parties and energy used in making
 distributing and transporting our products
 could increase the manufacturing and
distribution costs of our products. While in the past we have been able to mitigate the impact of these cost increases through
productivity improvements and pricing adjustments
 there is no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in
the future.

We
rely on the performance of wholesale distributors and other marketing arrangements and could be adversely affected by consolidation
poor performance or other disruptions in our distribution channels and customers.

The
replacement
 poor performance or financial default of a major distributor or one of its major customers could adversely affect
our business. Industry consolidation could also adversely affect our margins and profitability. Though large customers can offer
efficiencies and unique opportunities
 they can also seek to make significant changes in their volume of purchases
 represent
a large number of competing products
 negotiate more favorable terms and seek price reductions
 which could negatively impact
our financial results.


    
    


Our
operations may be adversely affected by failure to maintain or renegotiate distribution
 supply
 manufacturing or license agreements
on favorable terms.

We
have a number of distribution
 supply
 manufacturing and license agreements for our supplies and products. These agreements vary
depending on the particular supply and/or product
 but tend to be for a fixed number of years. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms or that these agreements will not be terminated. Termination of these
agreements or failure to renew these agreements on favorable terms could have a negative effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

If
we are unable to effectively manage organizational productivity and global supply chain efficiency and flexibility
 then our business
could be adversely affected.

We
need to continually evaluate our organizational productivity and supply chains and assess opportunities to reduce costs. We must
also enhance quality
 speed and flexibility to meet changing and uncertain market conditions. Our success also depends in part
on refining our cost structure and supply chains so that we have flexibility and are able to respond to market pressures to protect
profitability and cash flow or ramp up quickly and effectively to meet demand. Failure to achieve the desired level of quality
capacity or cost reductions could adversely affect our financial results. Despite our efforts to control costs and increase efficiency
in our facilities
 increased competition could still cause us to realize lower operating margins and profitability.

Our
operating results may fluctuate significantly
 which may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.

Our
operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors
 many of which are outside of our control. As a result of these
fluctuations
 financial planning and forecasting may be more difficult and comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period
basis may not necessarily be meaningful. Accordingly
 you should not rely on our annual and quarterly results of operations as
any indication of future performance. Each of the risk factors described in this &ldquo;Risks Related to Our Business&rdquo; section
and the following factors
 may affect our operating results:



    
    
our
    ability to continue to attract clients for our services and products;

    
    
the
    amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses
    operations and infrastructure;

    
    
our
    focus on long-term goals over short-term results;

    
    
the
    results of our investments in high risk products;

    
    
general
    economic conditions and those economic conditions specific to our industries;

    
    
changes
    in business cycles that affect the markets in which we sell our products and services; and

    
    
geopolitical
    events such as war
 threat of war or terrorist actions.


In
response to these fluctuations
 the value of our common stock could decrease significantly in spite of our operating performance.
In addition
 our business
 and the alcoholic beverage business
 has historically been cyclical and seasonal in nature
 reflecting
overall economic conditions as well as client budgeting and buying patterns.

The
cyclicality and seasonality in our business could become more pronounced and may cause our operating results to fluctuate more
widely.

We
have a history of losses
 have generated limited revenue to date
 and may continue to suffer losses in the future.

We
have a history of losses and have generated limited revenue to date. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable
future. If we cannot become profitable
 our financial condition will deteriorate
 and we may be unable to achieve our business
objectives
 including without limitation
 having to cease operations due to a lack of capital.

Our
accountants have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.

As
noted in our consolidated financial statements
 we had an accumulated stockholders&rsquo; deficit of $7
499
045 and recurring
losses from operations as of December 31
 2018. Our net loss for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2018 was $1
547
598.
We also had a working capital deficit of approximately $1
355
94 as of December 31
 2018. We intend to fund operations
through raising additional capital through debt financing and/or equity issuances and increased lending activities which may be
insufficient to fund our capital expenditures
 working capital or other cash requirements for the year ending December 31
 2018.
We are continuing to seek additional funds to finance our immediate and long term operations. The successful outcome of future
financing activities cannot be determined at this time and there is no assurance that if achieved
 we will have sufficient funds
to execute our intended business plan or generate positive operating results. These factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report for the fiscal years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 contain
a paragraph that emphasizes the substantial doubt as to our continuance as a going concern. This is a significant risk that we
may not be able to remain operational for an indefinite period of time.


    
    


We
will require substantial additional funding
 which may not be available to us on acceptable terms
 or at all
 and
 if not available
may require us to delay
 scale back or cease our marketing or product development activities and operations.

We
will require substantial additional capital in order to continue the marketing of our existing products and complete the development
of our contemplated products. Raising funds in the current economic climate may be difficult and additional funding may not be
available on acceptable terms
 or at all.

The
amount and timing of our future funding requirements
 both near- and long-term
 will depend on many factors
 including
 but not
limited to:



    
    
the
    number and characteristics of products that we pursue;

    
    
our
    potential need to expand operations
 including the hiring of additional employees;

    
    
the
    costs of licensing
 acquiring or investing in complimentary businesses
 products and technologies;

    
    
the
    effect of any competing technological or market developments;

    
    
the
    need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure
 including financial and reporting systems;

    
    
obtaining
    market acceptance of our alcohol-infused popsicles and ice cream; and

    
    
the
    economic and other terms
 timing of and success of our co-branding
 licensing
 collaboration or marketing relationships into
    which we have entered or may enter in the future.


Some
of these factors are outside of our control. We will require an additional capital infusion in order to expand the marketing of
our alcohol-infused popsicles and ice cream to all 50 states. Such additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from
our day-to-day activities
 which may adversely affect our ability to develop and market our alcohol-infused products. In addition
we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us
 if at all. If
we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms
 we may be required to significantly delay
 scale
back or discontinue the development or marketing of one or more of our products or product candidates or curtail our operations
which will have a Material Adverse Effect on our business
 operating results and prospects.

We
may sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into other arrangements to fund our operations
 which may result in dilution
to our stockholders and impose restrictions or limitations on our business.

We
may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings
 debt-financings
 or other third party funding or other
collaborations
 strategic alliances or licensing arrangements. These financing activities may have an adverse impact on our stockholders&rsquo;
rights as well as our operations. For instance
 any debt financing may impose restrictive covenants on our operations or otherwise
adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. In addition
 if we seek funds through arrangements with partners
these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies
 products or product candidates or otherwise
agree to terms unfavorable to us.

Acquisitions
we pursue in our industry and related industries could result in operating difficulties
 dilution to our stockholders and other
consequences harmful to our business.

As
part of our growth strategy
 we may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions in our industry and related industries. We may not
be able to consummate such acquisitions
 which could adversely impact our growth. If we do consummate acquisitions
 integrating
an acquired company
 business or technology may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures
 including:



    
    
increased
    expenses due to transaction and integration costs;

    
    
potential
    liabilities of the acquired businesses;

    
    
potential
    adverse tax and accounting effects of the acquisitions;

    
    
diversion
    of capital and other resources from our existing businesses;

    
    
diversion
    of our management&rsquo;s attention during the acquisition process and any transition periods;

    
    
loss
    of key employees of the acquired businesses following the acquisition; and

    
    
inaccurate
    budgets and projected financial statements due to inaccurate valuation assessments of the acquired businesses.


Foreign
acquisitions also involve unique risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages
 currency
risks and the particular economic
 political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.


    
    


Our
evaluations of potential acquisitions may not accurately assess the value or prospects of acquisition candidates
 and the anticipated
benefits from our future acquisitions may not materialize. In addition
 future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially
dilutive issuances of our equity securities
 including our common stock
 the incurrence of debt
 contingent liabilities or amortization
expenses
 or write-offs of goodwill
 any of which could harm our financial condition.

Interruption
or failure of our information technology systems could impair our ability to effectively and timely provide our services and products
which could damage our reputation and have an adverse impact on our operating results.

Our
systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes
 hurricanes
 terrorist attacks
 floods
 fires
 power loss
 telecommunications
failures
 computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems
 and similar events. Our facilities are located in areas with
a high risk of major earthquakes and are also subject to break-ins
 sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems
are not fully redundant
 and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural
disaster or other unanticipated problems at our Santa Monica
 California facility or manufacturing facility located in Orange
County
 California could result in lengthy interruptions in our projects and our ability to deliver services. An error or defect
in the software
 a failure in the hardware
 a failure of our backup facilities could delay our delivery of products and services
and could result in significantly increased production costs
 hinder our ability to retain and attract clients and damage our
brand if clients believe we are unreliable. Given our reliance on our industry relationships
 it could also result in a decrease
in our revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results.

We
cannot predict the effect that rapid changes in consumer taste may have on our business or industry.

The
alcoholic beverage and dessert industries are rapidly evolving
 primarily due to changing consumer preferences and technological
developments. The rapid growth of technology and shifting consumer tastes prevent us from being able to accurately predict the
overall effect that changing consumer preferences may have on our potential revenue and profitability. If we are unable to develop
and effectively market new products that adequately or competitively address the needs of these changing consumer preferences
it could have an adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.

Changes
in regulatory standards could adversely affect our business.

Our
business is subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements regarding distribution
 production
 labeling
and marketing. Changes to regulation of the alcohol industry could include increased limitations on advertising and promotional
activities or other non-tariff measures that could adversely impact our business. In addition
 we face government regulations
pertaining to the health and safety of our employees and our consumers as well as regulations addressing the impact of our business
on the environment
 domestically as well as internationally. Compliance with these health
 safety and environmental regulations
may require us to alter our manufacturing processes and our sourcing. Such actions could adversely impact our results of operations
cash flows and financial condition
 and our inability to effectively and timely comply with such regulations could adversely impact
our competitive position.

Changes
in excise taxes
 incentives and customs duties related to products containing alcohol could adversely affect our business.

Products
containing alcohol are subject to excise taxation in many markets at the federal
 state and/or local level. Any increase in federal
state or local excise taxes could have an adverse effect on our business by increasing prices and reducing demand
 particularly
if excise tax levels increase substantially relative to those for beer and wine. In addition
 products containing alcohol are
the subject of customs duties in many countries around the world. An unanticipated increase in customs duties in the markets where
we may sell our products could also adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

Our
insurance policies are expensive and only protect us from some business risks
 which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured
liabilities.

We
do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies that we generally maintain
include general liability
 automobile and property insurance. We do not know
 however
 if we will be able to maintain insurance
with adequate levels of coverage. In addition
 we do not know if we will be able to obtain and maintain coverage for the business
in which we engage. No assurance can be given that an insurance carrier will not seek to cancel or deny coverage after a claim
has occurred. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts
 which would adversely affect our
business
 financial condition and business results.

We
face potential product liability and
 if successful claims are brought against us
 we may incur substantial liability costs. If
the use of our products harms customers or third parties
 or is perceived to harm such persons even when such harm is unrelated
to our products
 our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly
and damaging product liability claims.

The
sale and use of our products exposes us to the risks of product liability claims. Product liability claims may be brought against
us by consumers or other third parties. In addition
 there is a risk that the use of our products could cause our customers to
have an adverse health event. If we cannot successfully defend our product liability claims
 we could incur substantial liability
and costs. In addition
 regardless of merit or eventual outcome
 product liability claims may result in: impairment of our business
reputation; costs due to related litigation; distraction of management&rsquo;s attention from our primary business; substantial
monetary awards to customers or other claimants; the inability to commercialize our products; and/or decreased demand for our
products.



    
    


We
believe our product liability insurance coverage as supplemented by our umbrella insurance policy is sufficient in light of our
current financial condition; however
 we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient
amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.

We
rely on a third-party co-packer
 with whom we co-developed our proprietary freezing technology
 to manufacture our alcohol infused
frozen products.

The
Company developed its proprietary technology with a third party who is also solely responsible for manufacturing all of our products.
The Company is subject to all of the risks inherent in relying upon a third party for all of its products
 including the fact
that the manufacturer only has facilities in Southern California and is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other disasters.
We do not have any other supplier for our products and if anything were to happen to this supplier
 including such supplier&rsquo;s
business failure
 our own business could be materially adversely affected.

Our
business is subject to the risks of earthquakes
 fires
 floods
 power outages and other catastrophic events
 and to interruption
by manmade problems such as terrorism. A disruption at our production facility could adversely impact our results of operations
cash flows and financial condition.

All
of our products are produced in one location
 which is located in Southern California. A significant natural disaster
 such as
an earthquake
 fire or a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business
 financial condition
or operating results. If there were a catastrophic failure at our major production facility
 our business would be adversely affected.
The loss of a substantial amount of inventory &ndash; through fire
 other natural or man-made disaster
 contamination
 or otherwise
&ndash; could result in a significant reduction in supply of the affected product or products. Similarly
 if we experienced a
disruption in the supply of our products
 our business could suffer. A consequence of any of these supply disruptions could be
our inability to meet consumer demand for the affected products for a period of time. In addition
 there can be no assurance that
insurance proceeds would cover the replacement value of our products or other assets if they were to be lost. In addition
 if
a catastrophe such as an earthquake
 fire
 flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely
 our business
prospects could be harmed. Moreover
 acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our third-party
service providers
 partners
 customers or the economy as a whole.

Others
may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us.

We
use alcohol products from other companies in the making of our alcohol infused frozen desserts. Infringement or misappropriation
claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from such claims) against us may be asserted or prosecuted
 regardless of their
merit
 and any such assertions or prosecutions may adversely affect our business and/or our operating results. Irrespective of
the validity or the successful assertion of such claims
 we would incur significant costs and diversion of resources relating
to the defense of such claims
 which could have an adverse effect on our business and/or our operating results.

The
inability to successfully manage the growth of our business may have an adverse effect on our operating results.

We
expect to experience growth in the number of employees and the scope of our operations. Such growth will result in increased responsibilities
for our management. If our management is unable to successfully manage expenses in a manner that allows us to both improve operations
and at the same time pursue potential market opportunities
 the growth of our business could be adversely impacted
 which may
in turn
 negatively affect our operating results or financial condition. In addition
 we believe that a critical contributor to
our success has been our creative culture. As we attempt to grow
 we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our
corporate culture
 which could negatively affect our future success.

We
operate in a highly regulated area.

The
alcohol industry is highly regulated on the national and state levels. These regulations are highly complex and
 at times
 may
even be contradictory. Our failure to comply with these overlapping regulatory structures could materially adversely affect our
business
 financial condition and results of operation.

Changes
in U.S.
 regional or global economic conditions could adversely affect our profitability.

A
decline in economic conditions in the United States or in other regions of the world could lead to a decrease in discretionary
consumer spending
 which in turn could adversely affect alcoholic type products. In addition
 an increase in price levels generally
or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector
 could result in a shift in consumer demand away from alcohol
type products.



    
    


Current
global economic challenges may continue and a recovery may be slow or reverse
 adversely impacting our results of operations
cash flows and financial condition.

Stable
economic conditions globally
 including strong employment
 consumer confidence and credit availability
 are important not only
to the basic health of our consumer markets
 but also to our own financial condition. There are presently significant challenges
in the global economy
 including high unemployment rates
 low consumer confidence
 record budget deficits and levels of government
debt
 and fragile credit and housing markets. In addition
 instability in the global credit markets
 including the recent European
economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries
 the instability in the geopolitical environment
in many parts of the world and other disruptions
 may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. As a result
 consumers&rsquo;
increased price consciousness may endure
 which may affect consumers&rsquo; willingness to pay for premium brands as well as the
overall level of consumption of products containing alcohol
 particularly in bars
 restaurants
 nightclubs and other public environments
where consumers drink spirits. Furthermore
 our suppliers and customers could experience cash flow problems
 increased costs or
reduced availability of financing
 credit defaults
 and other financial hardships. These factors may increase our bad debt expense
cause us to reduce the levels of unsecured credit that we may provide to customers and otherwise adversely impact our results
of operations
 cash flows and financial condition. A prolonged global economic stagnation may impact our access to capital markets
result in increased interest rates on debt that we may take on to expand operations
 and weaken operating cash flow and liquidity.
Decreased cash flow and liquidity could potentially impact our ability to finance operations.

Demand
for our alcohol-infused products may be adversely affected by many factors
 including changes in consumer preferences and trends.

Consumer
preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic and social trends
 public health initiatives
product innovations
 changes in travel
 vacation or leisure activity patterns and a downturn in economic conditions
 which may
reduce consumers&rsquo; willingness to purchase products that contain alcohol or cause a shift in consumer preferences toward
non-alcoholic alternatives. In addition
 concerns about health issues relating to alcohol consumption
 dietary effects
 regulatory
action or any litigation against companies in the industry may have an adverse effect on our business. Our success depends in
part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful
new products and product innovations. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products
 we may not be successful
in their development or these new products may not be commercially successful. In addition
 global economic conditions or market
trends could cause consumer preferences to trend away from our premium alcohol-infused popsicles and ice cream alternatives
 which
may also adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.

We
face substantial competition in our industry and many factors may prevent us from competing successfully.

We
compete on the basis of product taste and quality
 brand image
 price
 service and ability to innovate in response to consumer
preferences. It is possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or
effectively or resort to price competition to sustain market share
 both of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.
Further
 while we believe that our scale
 portfolio breadth and entrepreneurial organization relative to that of our competitors
gives us the ability to outperform our market
 we nevertheless face a risk that a continuing consolidation of the large distilled
spirits companies could cause us to experience competitive disadvantages. Our inability to manage these and other competitive
factors successfully could adversely affect our results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

Future
tax law changes and/or interpretation of existing tax laws may adversely affect our effective income tax rate and the resolution
of unrecognized tax benefits.

We
are subject to income taxation in the U.S. It is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a
material impact on our income tax provision. We believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and appropriate
 however
 there
are inherent uncertainties in these estimates. As a result
 the ultimate outcome from any potential audit could be materially
different from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Future settlements of income tax audits may have a
material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the timing
of ultimate tax audit settlement.

Some
provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us
by others
 even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.

Provisions
in our charter documents
 as well as provisions of Delaware law
 could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us
even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.

Potential
liabilities and costs from litigation and other legal proceedings could adversely affect our business.

From
time to time we may be subject to various lawsuits
 claims
 disputes and investigations in the normal conduct of our operations.
These include
 but are not limited to
 commercial disputes
 including purported class actions
 employment claims
 actions by tax
and customs authorities
 and environmental matters. Some of these legal proceedings may include claims for substantial or unspecified
damages. It is possible that some of the actions could be decided unfavorably and could adversely affect our results of operations
cash flows or financial condition. In addition
 because litigation and other legal proceedings can be costly to defend
 even actions
that are ultimately decided in our favor could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. If Tara Spencer
enforces the Labor Commission judgment against the Company for the amount owed
 this may result in a material adverse effect on
our financial condition.

Historical
financial statements may not be reflective of our future results of operations
 cash flows
 and financial condition.

Although
we believe that you have been provided access to all material information necessary to make an informed assessment of our assets
and liabilities
 financial position
 profits and losses and prospects
 historical financial statements do not represent what our
results of operations
 cash flows
 or financial position will be in the future.



    
    


Risks
Related to Our Common Stock

There
currently is only a minimal public market for our common stock. Failure to develop or maintain a trading market could negatively
affect the value of our common stock and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares.

There
currently is only a minimal public market for shares of our common stock and an active market may never develop. Our common stock
is quoted on the OTC Pink Market operated by the OTC Market&rsquo;s Group
 Inc. under the symbol &ldquo;PACV&rdquo;. We may not
ever be able to satisfy the listing requirements for our common stock to be listed on any stock exchange
 including the trading
platforms of the NASDAQ Stock Market which are often more widely-traded and liquid markets. Some
 but not all
 of the factors
which may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widely-traded and liquid market include the following: our
stockholders&rsquo; equity may be insufficient; the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low; our net income
from operations may be too low; our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held; we may not be able to secure market makers
for our common stock; and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by
 any of the several exchanges and markets
to have our common stock listed.

The
market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly
traded public float
 limited operating history and lack of profits which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You
may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your conversion price
 which may result in substantial losses to you.

The
market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers
 and we expect
that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. The volatility in our
share price is attributable to a number of factors. First
 as noted above
 our common stock are sporadically and thinly traded.
As a consequence of this lack of liquidity
 the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately
influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could
 for example
 decline precipitously in
the event that a large number of our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand
 as compared to a seasoned
issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price. Secondly
 we are a speculative or &ldquo;risky&rdquo;
investment due to our limited operating history and lack of profits to date
 and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our
potential products and services. As a consequence of this enhanced risk
 more risk-adverse investors may
 under the fear of losing
all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress
 be more inclined to sell their shares on the
market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer. Many of these factors
are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock
 regardless of our operating performance. We cannot
make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time
 including
as to whether our common stock will sustain their current market prices
 or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability
of common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.

The
application of the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase your
transaction costs to sell those shares.

The
SEC has adopted rule 3a51-1 which establishes the definition of a &ldquo;penny stock
&rdquo; for the purposes relevant to us
as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
 Rule 15g-9 requires:



    
    
that
    a broker or dealer approve a person&rsquo;s account for transactions in penny stocks
 and

    
    
the
    broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction
 setting forth the identity and quantity
    of the penny stock to be purchased.


In
order to approve a person&rsquo;s account for transactions in penny stocks
 the broker or dealer must:



    
    
obtain
    financial information and investment experience objectives of the person
 and

    
    
make
    a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient
    knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.



    
    


The
broker or dealer must also deliver
 prior to any transaction in a penny stock
 a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating
to the penny stock market
 which
 in highlight form:



    
    
sets
    forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination
 and

    
    
that
    the broker or dealer received a signed
 written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.


Generally
brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules. This may make
it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.

The
application of Rule 144 creates some investment risk to potential investors; for example
 existing shareholders may be able to
rely on Rule 144 to sell some of their holdings
 driving down the price of the shares you purchased.

The
SEC adopted amendments to Rule 144 which became effective on February 15
 2008 that apply to securities acquired both before and
after that date. Under these amendments
 a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least
six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that: (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates
at the time of
 or at any time during the three months preceding a sale
 (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting
requirements for at least 90 days before the sale and (iii) if the sale occurs prior to satisfaction of a one-year holding period
we provide current information at the time of sale.

Persons
who have beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time
of
 or at any time during the three months preceding a sale
 would be subject to additional restrictions
 by which such person
would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of either
of the following:



    
    
1%
    of the total number of securities of the same class then outstanding (shares of common stock as of the date of this Report);
    or

    
    
the
    average weekly trading volume of such securities during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144
    with respect to the sale;


provided
in each case
 that we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale.
Such sales by affiliates must also comply with the manner of sale
 current public information and notice provisions of Rule 144.

Shannon
Masjedi
 our majority stockholder
 director and executive officer
 owns a large percentage of our voting stock
 which allows her
to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.



 our majority stockholder
director and executive officer
 will have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval
including the election of directors
 any merger
 consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other
significant corporate transaction. In particular
 because our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Interim Chief Financial Officer
Treasurer
 Secretary and a director
 Mrs. Masjedi
 who owns 13
864
369 shares of our common stock and 1
000
000 shares of Series
E Preferred Stock (with 10 votes per share) as of March 25
 2018
 will be able to exert such influence. This shareholder
may also delay or prevent a change of control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of
us
 even if such a change of control would benefit our other shareholders. This significant concentration of stock and voting
ownership may adversely affect the value of our common stock due to investors&rsquo; perception that conflicts of interest may
exist or arise.


We
do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.

We
do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will
retain all of our available cash
 if any
 for use as working capital and for other general corporate purposes. Any payment of
future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon
 among other things
 our earnings
 financial
condition
 capital requirements
 level of indebtedness
 statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends
and other considerations that the Board of Directors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after
price appreciation
 which may never occur
 as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends
should not purchase our common stock.

Risks
Related to Our Acquisition Strategy

We
can give no assurances as to when we will consummate any other future acquisitions or whether we will consummate any of them at
all.

We
intend to continue to build our business through strategic acquisitions. However
 any acquisition is subject to certain closing
conditions and other impediments to closing
 including closing the financing and others that are beyond our control
 and we may
not be able to close on the terms described herein or at all. See above &ldquo;Business &mdash; Recent Developments and Initiatives.&rdquo;


    
    


We
intend to pursue and consummate one or more additional acquisitions and to possibly use any remaining proceeds from the Financing
if any
 to fund any cash portion of the consideration we will pay in connection with those acquisitions. However
 such additional
acquisitions may also be subject to conditions and other impediments to closing
 including some that are beyond our control
 and
we may not be able to close any of them successfully. In addition
 our future acquisitions will be required to be closed within
certain timeframes as negotiated between us and the acquisition target
 and if we are unable to meet the closing deadlines for
a given transaction
 we may be required to forfeit payments we have made
 if any
 be forced to renegotiate the transaction on
less advantageous terms and could fail to consummate the transaction at all.

If
we are unable to close future acquisitions
 it could significantly alter our business strategy and impede our prospects for growth.
Further
 we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates to replace these acquisitions
 and even if we were to
do so
 we may only be able to consummate them on less advantageous terms. In addition
 some of the businesses we acquire may incur
significant losses from operations
 which
 in turn
 could have a material and adverse impact on our business
 results of operations
and financial condition.

We
may face difficulty in integrating the operations of any businesses we may acquire in the future. As shown by our acquisition
of SDFO
 acquisitions have been and will continue to be an important component of our growth strategy; however
 we will need to
integrate these acquired businesses successfully in order for our growth strategy to succeed and for us to become profitable.
We expect that the management teams of the acquired businesses will adopt our policies
 procedures and best practices
 and cooperate
with each other in scheduling events
 booking talent and in other aspects of their operations. We may face difficulty with the
integration of any other businesses we acquire
 such as coordinating geographically dispersed organizations
 integrating personnel
with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures
 the diversion of management&rsquo;s attention
from other business concerns
 the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no
direct experience; and the potential loss of key employees
 individual service providers
 customers and strategic partners of
acquired companies.

Further
we expect that future target companies may have material weaknesses in internal controls relating to the proper application of
accrual based accounting under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;)
prior to our acquiring them. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) defines a material weakness
as a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. We will be relying on the proper implementation of our policies and procedures to remedy any such material weaknesses
and prevent any potential material misstatements in our financial reporting. Any such misstatement could adversely affect the
trading price of our common stock
 cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information
 and subject us to
civil and criminal fines and penalties. If our acquired companies fail to integrate in these important ways
 or we fail to adequately
understand the business operations of our acquired companies
 our growth and financial results could suffer.

We
may enter into acquisitions and take actions in connection with such transactions that could adversely affect our business and
results of operations.

Our
future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses and assets. We may be unable to identify
suitable targets for acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate
our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors
 and may include our ability to obtain
financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals. In addition
 any credit agreements or credit facilities that
we may enter into in the future may restrict our ability to make certain acquisitions. In connection with future acquisitions
we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business
 including:



    
    
using
    a significant portion of our available cash;

    
    
issuing
    equity securities
 which would dilute current stockholders&rsquo; percentage ownership;

    
    
incurring
    substantial debt;

    
    
incurring
    or assuming contingent liabilities
 known or unknown;

    
    
incurring
    amortization expenses related to intangibles; and

    
    
incurring
    large accounting write-offs or impairments.


We
may also enter into joint ventures
 which involve certain unique risks
 including
 among others
 risks relating to the lack of
full control of the joint venture
 potential disagreements with our joint venture partners about how to manage the joint venture
conflicting interests of the joint venture
 requirement to fund the joint venture and its business not being profitable.

In
addition
 we cannot be certain that the due diligence investigation that we conduct with respect to any investment or acquisition
opportunity will reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity.
For example
 instances of fraud
 accounting irregularities and other deceptive practices can be difficult to detect. Executive
officers
 directors and employees may be named as defendants in litigation involving a company we are acquiring or have acquired.
Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a particular investment or acquisition
 we may fail to uncover all material issues
relating to such investment
 including regarding controls and procedures of a particular target or the full scope of its contractual
arrangements. We rely on our due diligence to identify potential liabilities in the businesses we acquire
 including such things
as potential or actual lawsuits
 contractual obligations or liabilities imposed by government regulation. However
 our due diligence
process may not uncover these liabilities
 and where we identify a potential liability
 we may incorrectly believe that we can
consummate the acquisition without subjecting ourselves to that liability. Therefore
 it is possible that we could be subject
to litigation in respect of these acquired businesses. If our due diligence fails to identify issues specific to an investment
or acquisition
 we may obtain a lower return from that transaction than the investment would return or otherwise subject ourselves
to unexpected liabilities. We may also be forced to write-down or write-off assets
 restructure our operations or incur impairment
or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions
about us or our shares of common stock.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS


From
time to time
 the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of
business. However
 litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties
 and an adverse result in these or other matters may have
individually or in the aggregate
 a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition or operating results. The Company
is currently not aware of any pending legal proceedings
 other than as set forth below.



 2017
 Tara Spencer filed a
claim in the Los Angeles Superior Court against the Company
 Shannon Masjedi
 Edmond Masjedi and Snobar Holdings (collectively
&ldquo;Defendants&rdquo;). On July 18
 2018
 all parties to the claim settled the law suit and chose not disclose the terms
of the settlement.


On
November 29
 2018
 assignees of certain convertible redeemable promissory notes of the Company with an aggregate principal balance
of $223
499 commenced an action in the New York Supreme Court for New York County against the Company (BNA Investment Capital
LLC and TRA Capital
 LLC v. Pacific Ventures Group
 Inc.
 Index Number 655927 (Supreme Court
 New York County 2018)). The suit
was brought by the plaintiff&rsquo;s by a motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint. The motion asserts breaches of contract
due to failure to honor certain conversion notices allegedly tendered pursuant to the convertible notes and cross-default. The
Company has opposed the motion
 but the court has not scheduled arguments or rendered any decision.

On
February 22
 2018
 a holder of a convertible note in the principal amount of $75

commenced and action in the Supreme Court New York against the Company. (JSJ v. Pacific Ventures). The
suit asserts breach of contract due to failure to honor certain conversion notices allegedly tendered pursuant to the convertible
note. 

We
intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuits described above. There is no assurance
 however
 that we will be successful in
the defense of these lawsuits. Moreover
 we are unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses
at this time. A resolution of these lawsuits in a manner adverse to us
 however
 could have a material effect on our financial
position and results of operations.

MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


You
should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts
 but
rather are based on current expectations
 estimates
 assumptions and projections about our industry
 business and future financial
results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a
number of factors
 including those discussed under &ldquo;Item 1A. Risk Factors&rdquo; and other sections in this Annual Report.

The
following discussion highlights Pacific Ventures&rsquo; results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our
financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management
believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented
herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on Pacific Ventures&rsquo; audited Financial Report
 which we have prepared
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis together
with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.

Basis
of Presentation

The
audited financial statements for our fiscal years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 include a summary of our significant accounting
policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management
 all material adjustments necessary
to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements. All such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.



Overview
 During 2017
 the South Carolina distributor expanded the account base for Sn&ouml;Bar and has many successful
placements for the brand. Furthermore
 additional funding has also been unavailable to pursue additional geographic markets
 both
domestic and international. Despite such challenges
 during 2017
 the Company continued development of the Snobar Product Line
with the goal to fulfill the current orders that the brand has in hand from the Company&rsquo;s distributor in South Carolina
as well as from other accounts. In addition
 the Company further continued with its strategy of selectively pursue strategic acquisitions
in its industry and related industries
 culminating in the execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement with San Diego Farmers Outlet
Inc. The Company is currently working on satisfying the closing conditions under the Asset Purchase Agreement
 including obtaining
the necessary Financing
 and hope to close the transaction during the second quarter of 2018. There can be no assurance
 however
that the Financing and the asset acquisition will be consummated or as to the date by which the asset acquisition may be consummated
if at all.

Overview
 During the 2018 fiscal year
 the Company completed an asset acquisition of San Diego Farmers Outlet
 Inc.
(SDFO)
 a California Corporation with over thirty-five (35) years in business servicing restaurant and retail produce customers
in southern California&rsquo;s three largest counties
 supplying quality food and produce. SDFO does business under the name of
Farmers Outlet and San Diego Farmers Outlet. On Sept. 24
 2018
 the Company announced the signing of a definitive Asset Purchase
Agreement to acquire a food and beverage distribution company that is involved in the sale of food
 beverages and general merchandise
to retailers
 households
 hotels
 restaurants
 &ldquo;mom and pop&rdquo; markets
 liquor stores
 gas stations and other retail
outlets.



In
Fiscal Year 2019
 the Company&rsquo;s strategy is focused on:



    
    
incrementally
    increase sales and profitability of San Diego Farmers Outlet (SDFO)

    
    
expanding
    Sn&ouml;bar production and distribution

    
    
acquisition
    of food production or distribution companies that are synergistic with SDFO


We
plan to grow SDFO&rsquo;s wholesale business by expanding its delivery territory from 25 miles to a 40-mile radius
 and add to
the current fleet of delivery trucks. The Company has already begun marketing to new restaurants in the area
 most notably Asian
and Italian restaurants
 and have let restaurants know that SDFO can deliver the finest produce in market.

We
plan to expand Sn&ouml;bar production and distribution by partnering with third-party manufacturers and co-packers
 and with third-party
distributors that can sell Sn&ouml;bar products to high-end restaurants
 resorts
 cruise lines and hotels worldwide. Initially
the focus will be on establishing major accounts in four core markets consisting of Southern California
 Phoenix
 Las Vegas and
Miami. The larger vision is to sell products in grocery stores such as Kroger
 Wal-Mart and others
 and thereafter to begin a
national marketing program to all U.S. retailers. It is essentially a top down marketing plan where products are placed with the
largest retailer then trickle down to the smallest seller in each market area

We
plan to acquire food production and distribution businesses that will help the Company grow its food
 beverage and alcohol-related
products businesses. We continue to engage in preliminary discussions with potential investors in order to properly fund potential
acquisitions
 however
 there are no assurances that the required funding will be available on terms acceptable to us
 or at all.



    
    


Going
Concern

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
this Annual Report and in the notes to the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein
 we have
incurred operating losses
 and as at December 31
 2018 and 2017
 we have accumulated deficit of $7
499
045 and $5
970
024
 respectively.
For the year ended December 31
 2018
 we have a working capital deficiency of approximately $1
355
944. These factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally
 our independent registered public accounting firm included
an explanatory paragraph in their report for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 regarding concerns about our ability to
continue as a going concern.

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating operating cash flow and raising capital sufficient to
fund operations. We have discussed our strategy and plans relating to these matters elsewhere in this Current Report although
the consolidated financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties. Our business strategy may not be successful in funding ongoing operations and accelerating our domestic and international
expansion
 and if we cannot continue as a going concern
 our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us.

Plan
of Operations for the Next Twelve Months

Pacific
Ventures will need approximately $500
000 to sustain operations for the next 12 months. Our plan is to achieve meaningful sales
revenue from the sale of the SDFO products to meet our operating needs. However
 it is very likely that we will not be able to
increase our sale revenue sufficiently to meet these needs in time. It is also unlikely that we will be able to satisfy all of
our obligations to pay interest and repay principal in the estimated aggregate amount of $976
120 due and payable within the next
12 months under the various forms of our outstanding debt. Although we have been able to extend the maturity dates as well as
repayment terms of a substantial amount of such debt
 there is no assurance that we will be able to further extend such repayments
or maturity dates to avoid a default
 as such further extension depends on the consent of the holders of such debt. If we are
unable to make such payments and repayments and unable to extend and delay required payments or maturities of such debt
 the holders
of such debt will have the right to take legal action seeking enforcement of the debt. If any legal action is taken against us
we would face the risk of having to deplete our limited cash resources to defend against such suit or face the entry of a default
judgment. In either event
 such action would have grave impact on our operations. Our ability to continue operations will be dependent
upon the successful completion of additional long-term or permanent equity financing
 the support of creditors and shareholders
and
 ultimately
 the achievement of profitable operations. There can be no assurances that we will be successful
 which would
in turn significantly affect our ability to be successful in our new business plan. If not
 we will likely be required to reduce
operations or liquidate assets. We will continue to evaluate our projected expenditures relative to our available cash and to
seek additional means of financing in order to satisfy our working capital and other cash requirements.

Critical
Accounting Estimates

We
regularly evaluate the accounting estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies
is included in the Notes to our audited financial statements. In general
 management&rsquo;s estimates are based on historical
experience
 on information from third party professionals
 and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.


    
    


We
believe that of our significant accounting policies
 which are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements
 the
following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly
 these are the policies we believe
are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

Revenue
Recognition &#8213;
Farmers Outlet provides specialty produce that the larger distributors do not carry on a daily basis. Farmers Outlet&rsquo;s customers
comprise restaurants
 hotels
 clubs and bars
 resorts
 food trucks and caterers. Sales revenues are generally recognized when
the products are shipped or delivered to the customers
 net of discounts
 returns and allowance and collectability is reasonably
assured.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk &#8213;
Deposit Insurance Corporation (&ldquo;FDIC&rdquo;) up to federally insured limits. At times balances may exceed FDIC insured limits.
We have not experienced any losses in such accounts.

Accounts
Receivable (AR): AR as at the years-ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 were $280
142 and $6
589
 respectively. Historically
 customer
accounts typically are collected within a short period of time
 and based on its assessment of current conditions and its experience
collecting such receivables
 management believes it has no significant risk related to its concentration within its accounts receivable.

850
389 as compared to $486
820 at December 31

582
 as compared to $1
314
261
and $1
668
082
 respectively
 for December 31
 2017.

We
depend upon debt and/or equity financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan. If continued funding
and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms we may curtail our plan of operations. We will be required to obtain
alternative or additional financing from financial institutions or otherwise
 in order to maintain and expand our existing operations.
The failure by us to obtain such financing would have a material adverse effect upon our business
 financial condition and results
of operations.

Capital
Resources

Our
principal sources of liquidity have been cash generated by issuing convertible notes
 loan proceeds and cash generated from operations.
Management estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue operations through March 31
 2019.

In
order to be able to achieve our strategic goals
 we need to further expand our business and financing activities. Expanding market
awareness of the Sn&ouml;Bar products and our international distribution networks
 together with further improvement of the Sn&ouml;Bar
products will require future capital and liquidity expansion. Since 2013
 our shareholders have contributed a significant amount
of capital making it possible for us to develop and market the Sn&ouml;Bar products. To continue to develop our product offerings
and expand our services and to realize an international coverage a significant capital increase has been and will continue to
be required. We have drafted an investment plan and concluded we should enter in the process of raising additional capital from
current shareholders and new investors.

We
plan to continue raising capital in order to meet our liquidity needs. However
 we may be unable to raise sufficient additional
capital when we need it or to raise capital on favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms
we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on
unattractive terms.

We
do not currently have any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt and
 accordingly we could incur significant amounts
of indebtedness to finance operations. Any such indebtedness could contain covenants which would restrict our operations.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 revenues
and expenses
 and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. The SEC has defined a company&rsquo;s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal
of the company&rsquo;s financial condition and results of operations
 and which require the company to make its most difficult
and subjective judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this
definition
 we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting
policies
 which involve the use of estimates
 judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results
 which
are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Although we believe that our estimates
 assumptions and judgments
are reasonable
 they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates
under different assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Shareholders and the Board of Directors
Pacific
Ventures Group Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
(the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as
of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the related statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; deficit
 for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31
 2017
 and the related notes [and schedules] (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial
statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position
of the Company as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31
 2018
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a
test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical
Audit Matters

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging
 subjective
 or complex judgments. The communication of
critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements
 taken as a whole
 and we are not
 by
communicating the critical audit matters below
 providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or
disclosures to which they relate.

There
are no critical audit matters.3

The
Company&rsquo;s financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern
which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has
an accumulated deficit of $7
499
045 and a negative cash flow from operations amounting to $1
547
598 for the year ended December
31
 2018. These factors as discussed in Note 3 of the financial statements raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

Group
 Inc.&rdquo;.

The
current structure of the Company resulted from a share exchange with Sn&ouml;bar Holdings
 Inc. (&ldquo;Sn&ouml;bar Holdings&rdquo;)
which was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. On August 14
 2015
 the Company entered into a share exchange agreement
(the &ldquo;Share Exchange Agreement&rdquo;) with Sn&ouml;bar Holdings
 pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued
and outstanding shares of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings&rsquo; Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22
500
000 restricted shares
of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 while simultaneously issuing 2
500
000 restricted shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
to certain other persons
 including for services provided and to a former officer of the Company (the &ldquo;Share Exchange&rdquo;).

As
the result of the Share Exchange
 Sn&ouml;bar Holdings became the Company&rsquo;s wholly owned operating subsidiary and the business
of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings became the Company&rsquo;s sole business operations and MAS Global Distributors
 Inc.
 a California corporation
(&ldquo;MGD&rdquo;)
 became an indirect subsidiary of the Company.

Prior
to the Share Exchange
 the Company operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries
 which marketed and underwrote
specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace. However
 in 1997
 after selling several
of its divisions
 the Company&rsquo;s remaining insurance operations were placed into receivership and the Company ceased operating
its insurance business.

Since
the Share Exchange represented a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations
 the Company&rsquo;s business
operations changed to that of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are solely
that of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings and its affiliates and subsidiaries comprising of Sn&ouml;bar Trust 
 International Production Impex
Corporation
 a California corporation (&ldquo;IPIC&rdquo;) 
 and MGD.

Sn&ouml;bar
Holdings was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7
 2013. Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary
of Sn&ouml;bar Trust
 a California trust (&ldquo;Trust&rdquo;)
 which was formed in June 1
 2013. The current trustee that holds
legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge
 the father of Shannon Masjedi
 the Company&rsquo;s President
 Chief Executive Officer
Interim Chief Financial Officer
 Treasurer
 and majority stockholder. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of IPIC
 which was formed
on August 2
 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops
 and holds all of the rights to the
liquor licenses to sell such products and trade names &ldquo;Sn&ouml;bar&rdquo;. As such
 the Trust holds all ownership interest
of IPIC and its liquor licenses
 permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors
 with all income
 expense
 gains and losses
rolling up to the Trust
 of which Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is the sole beneficiary. Sn&ouml;bar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares
of MGD. MGD is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services. As a result of the foregoing
Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of all assets
 liabilities and any income received from the business of the Trust
and IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD.

The
Trust and IPIC are considered variable interest entities (&ldquo;VIEs&rdquo;) and Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is identified as the primary
beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification
(&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 810
 Sn&ouml;bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
As the assessment of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings&rsquo; management is that Sn&ouml;bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities
of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&rsquo;s activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC)
 and
the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE&rsquo;s economic performance
 it was therefore concluded by management
that Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such
 the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the
financial statements of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings since the inception of the Trust
 in the case of the Trust
 and since the inception
of Sn&ouml;bar Holdings
 in the case of IPIC.

On
May 1
 2018
 Royalty Foods Partners
 LLC &ndash; a Florida Limited Liability Corporation and a subsidiary of Pacific Ventures
Group
 Inc. &ndash; completed an asset acquisition of San Diego Farmers Outlet
 Inc. (SDFO)
 a California Corporation. San Diego
Farmers Outlet was started in over thirty-five years ago to provide primarily restaurants customers in southern California&rsquo;s
three largest counties with quality food and produce
 and does business under the name of Farmers Outlet and San Diego Farmers
Outlet.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
 Sn&ouml;bar Holdings and its subsidiaries
 in which Sn&ouml;bar
Holdings has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities (&ldquo;VIE&rdquo;)
provisions of ASC 810
 &ldquo;Consolidation&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 810&rdquo;). Inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated upon consolidation.

The
Company applies the provisions of ASC 810 which provides a framework for identifying VIEs and determining when a company should
include the assets
 liabilities
 non-controlling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements.

In
general
 a VIE is a corporation
 partnership
 limited-liability corporation
 trust
 or any other legal structure used to conduct
activities or hold assets that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional
subordinated financial support
 (2) has a group of equity owners that is unable to make significant decisions about its activities
(3) has a group of equity owners that does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated
by its operations or (4) the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected
losses of the entity
 their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity
 or both and substantially all of the
entity&rsquo;s activities (for example
 providing financing or buying assets) either involve or are conducted on behalf of an
investor that has disproportionately fewer voting rights.

ASC
810 requires a VIE to be consolidated by the party with an ownership
 contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (a variable
interest holder) that has both of the following characteristics: a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly
impact the VIE&rsquo;s economic performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant
to the VIE
 or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

A
variable interest holder that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. If the primary beneficiary of a variable
interest entity (VIE) and the VIE are under common control
 the primary beneficiary shall initially measure the assets
 liabilities
and non-controlling interests of the VIE at amounts at which they are carried in the accounts of the reporting entity that controls
the VIE (or would be carried if the reporting entity issued financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles). ASC 810 also requires disclosures about VIEs in which the variable interest holder is not required to
consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest.



    
SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the Company
 Sn&ouml;bar Holdings
 San Diego Farmers Outlet
 MGD
 IPIC and the Trust
which was established to hold IPIC
 which in turn holds liquor licenses. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated during
consolidation. See the discussion in Note 1 above for variable interest entity treatment of the Trust and IPIC.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

Sales
revenues are generally recognized in accordance with the SAB 104 Public Company Guidance
 when an agreement exists and price is
determinable
 the products are shipped to the customers or services are rendered
 net of discounts
 returns and allowance and
collectability is reasonably assured. We are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance
of recognizing the revenue. In the instances in which we have received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue
we include the amounts in deferred or unearned revenue on our consolidated balance sheet.

Unearned
Revenue

Certain
amounts are received pursuant to agreements or contracts and may only be used in the conduct of specified transactions or the
related services are yet to be performed. These amounts are recorded as unearned or deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue
in the year/period the related expenses are incurred or services are performed. As at December 31
 2018
 the Company has $0 in
deferred revenue. This is comparable to deferred revenue balance of $15
042 as of December 31
 2017
 which was as a result of
prepayment by two of its customers.

Shipping
and Handling Costs

The
Company&rsquo;s shipping costs are all recorded as operating expenses for all periods presented.

Disputed
Liabilities

The
Company is involved in a variety of disputes
 claims
 and proceedings concerning its business operations and certain liabilities.
We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and
can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available
information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters
which involves an analysis of potential results
 assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments
in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a
material accrual
 or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts
 they
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
 cash flows and financial position in the period or periods
in which such change in determination
 judgment or settlement occurs. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company has $0 in disputed
liabilities on its balance sheet.

Cash
Equivalents

The
Company considers highly liquid instruments with original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December
31
 2018
 the Company had a cash balance of $151
058 in cash and cash equivalents
 compared to $69 at December 31
 2017.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are stated at net realizable value of $280
142. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts. The allowance is calculated based upon the level of past due accounts and the relationship with and financial status
of our customers. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company wrote off $3
820 of bad debt expense. The Company did not write off any
during the year ended December 31
 2017.



Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost has been determined using the first-in
 first-out method. Inventory quantities
on-hand are regularly reviewed
 and where necessary
 reserves for excess and unusable inventories are recorded. Inventory consists
of finished goods and includes ice cream
 popsicles and the related packaging materials. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company
had $160
858 of inventory assets consisting of San Diego Farmers Outlet
 Inc.&rsquo;s fresh produce and food products. As of December
31
 2017
 the Company has $0 in inventories.

Income
Taxes

Deferred
taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences
and operating loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences
are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
on the date of enactment.

Net
Income/(Loss) Per Common Share

Income/(loss)
per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net income/(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. The Company has no potentially dilutive securities. Accordingly
 basic and dilutive income/(loss)
per common share are the same.

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and includes expenditures that substantially increase the useful
lives of existing property and equipment. Maintenance
 repairs
 and minor renovations are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement
of property and equipment
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting
gain or loss is included in the results of operations. The Company provides for depreciation of property and equipment using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease
 as appropriate. The estimated useful lives are
as follows: vehicles
 five years; office furniture and equipment
 three to fifteen years; equipment
 three years.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable.
The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions within the United States which are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (&ldquo;FDIC&rdquo;) up to limits of approximately $250
000. The Company has not experienced any losses
with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
Company considers revenue recognition and the valuation of accounts receivable
 allowance for doubtful accounts
 and inventory
and reserves as its significant accounting policies. Some of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions
that may affect the reported amounts in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2009
 the FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;Codification&rdquo; or &ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) as the
source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).
Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) issued under authority of federal
securities laws are also sources of GAAP for SEC registrants. Existing GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the
Codification
 and accordingly the change did not impact our financial statements. The ASC does change the way the guidance is
organized and presented.

In
April 2015
 FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) No. 2015-03
 &ldquo;Interest &ndash; Imputation of Interest
(Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs&rdquo;
 to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs
by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the carrying amount of that debt liability
 consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement
guidance for debt issuance costs. For public companies
 the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted.

In
April 2015
 FASB issued ASU No. 2015-04
 &ldquo;Compensation &ndash; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for
the Measurement Date of an Employer&rsquo;s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets&rdquo;
 which permits the entity to measure
defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity&rsquo;s fiscal year-end and apply
that practical expedient consistently from year to year. The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is
permitted.

In
April 2015
 FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05
 &ldquo;Intangibles &ndash; Goodwill and Other &ndash; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic
350-40): Customer&rsquo;s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement&rdquo;
 which provides guidance to customers
about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If such includes a software license
 then the customer
should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.
If the arrangement does not include a software license
 the customer should account for it as a service contract. For public business
entities
 the ASU is effective for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December
15
 2015. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be
any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.

In
April 2015
 FASB issued ASU No. 2015-06
 &ldquo;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master
Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions&rdquo;
 which specifies that
 for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit
under the two-class method
 the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should
be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance
 the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners
(which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown
transaction. Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction
occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted.

In
June 2014
 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10
 &ldquo;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&rdquo;. The update removes
all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915
from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. In addition
 the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties
(Topic 275) to illustrate one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about
the risks and uncertainties related to the company&rsquo;s current activities. Furthermore
 the update removes an exception provided
to development stage entities in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which
may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest
in a company in the development stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted with the first annual reporting period or interim period for
which the entity&rsquo;s financial statements have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made available for issuance
(other entities). Our company adopted this pronouncement.

In
June 2014
 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12
 &ldquo;Compensation &ndash; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based
Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&rdquo;.
The amendments in this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms
of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The
amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period
be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards
with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective
for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted.
Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date
or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual
period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
the cumulative effect of applying this Update as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements
should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition
is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected
to have a material impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.

In
August 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on &ldquo;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &ndash;
Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&rdquo;. Currently
 there is no guidance
in GAAP about management&rsquo;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance.
In doing so
 the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments
require management to assess an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain
principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial
doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the
mitigating effect of management&rsquo;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result
of consideration of management&rsquo;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is
not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued
(or available to be issued).

All
other newly issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

We
reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and determined these have no current applicability to the Company
or their effect on the financial statements would not have been significant.



    
GOING
    CONCERN


The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
 the Company has incurred a net loss of $1
547
598 for the year ended December
31
 2018 and has an accumulated deficit of $7
499
045 as at December 31
 2018.

In
order to continue as a going concern
 the Company will need
 among other things
 additional capital resources. The Company is
significantly dependent upon its ability
 and will continue to attempt
 to secure equity and/or additional debt financing. There
are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to
continue as a going concern.

The
audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded assets
 or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue
in existence. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. These
audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.



    
    


As
of December 31
 2018
 the Company had inventory assets for a total of $160
858. No inventories were recorded as of December 31
2017.

and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse.

rate of 10% and an original maturity date of December 31

modification. The agreement increased the principal balance of the note as of December 31
 2014 to $527
333 and all interest due

 2017 (&ldquo;First Extended Maturity Date&rdquo;). Commencing on January 1
 2016
 Sn&ouml;bar Holdings was to
make monthly payments of $15
000 until the First Extended Maturity Date. Assuming Sn&ouml;bar Holdings was not in default with
respect to its obligations as of the First Extended Maturity Date

31

 2017
 the monthly payments increased to $25
000
for every month until the Second Extended Maturity Date. All accrued but unpaid interest
 charges and the remaining principal
balance of the note was fully due and payable on the Second Extended Maturity Date. In January of 2016 the company decided to
enter into renegotiation period for the repayment terms of the modification dated January 29
 2015. As a result of the renegotiation
with the note holder

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our
management
 under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation (the
&ldquo;Evaluation&rdquo;) of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without
limitation
 controls and procedures designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the
time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms
 and is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our
principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that
 as of December 31
 2018
 due to the presence of material weaknesses described below
 our disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective because of the material weaknesses described below.

Notwithstanding
the foregoing
 there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons
within our Company and our consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our
periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures
 including
the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly
 even effective
disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for our Company. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed
by
 or under the supervision of
 our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors
management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies
and procedures that:



    
    
Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the assets of the company;

    
    
    

    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

    
    
    

    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the company&rsquo;s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its
inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and
is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failure. Internal control over financial reporting can also
be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations
 there is a risk that material misstatements
may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However
 these inherent limitations
are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
though not eliminate
 this risk.

We
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2018. In making this assessment
our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;) of the Treadway Commission&rsquo;s
Internal Control-Integrated Framework. As a result of this assessment
 we have determined that our internal control over financial
reporting was ineffective as of December 31
 2018. We had neither the resources
 nor the personnel
 to provide an adequate control
environment. The following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist at December
31
 2018:



    
    
we
    do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
    over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;



    
    




    
    
we
    outsourced the functions of the principal financial officer on an interim basis to assist us in implementing the necessary
    financial controls over the financial reporting and the utilization of internal management and staff to effectuate these controls;

    
    
    

    
    
we
    do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions
 which is a basic internal control. Due to our limited
    size and early stage nature of operations
 segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be
    economically feasible; however
 to the extent possible
 the initiation of transactions
 the custody of assets and the recording
    of transactions should be performed by separate individuals;

    
    
    

    
    
we
    do not have an independent audit committee of our board of directors; and

    
    
    

    
    
there
    is insufficient monitoring and review controls over the financial reporting closing process
 including the lack of individuals
    with current knowledge of GAAP that led to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements.


We
believe that these material weaknesses primarily relate
 in part
 to our lack of sufficient staff with appropriate training in
GAAP and SEC rules and regulations with respect to financial reporting functions
 and the lack of robust accounting systems
 as
well as the lack of sufficient resources to hire such staff and implement these accounting systems.

Pending
obtaining sufficient resources to implement these measures
 we plan to take a number of actions to correct these material weaknesses
including
 but not limited to
 establishing an audit committee of our board of directors comprised of three independent directors
adding experienced accounting and financial personnel and retaining third-party consultants to review our internal controls and
recommend improvements. However
 we may need to take additional measures to fully mitigate these issues
 and the measures we have
taken
 and expect to take
 to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to (1) address the issues identified
 (2) ensure
that our internal controls are effective or (3) ensure that the identified material weakness or other material weaknesses will
not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements.

It
should be noted that any system of controls
 however well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition
 the design of any control system is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of certain events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems
 there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
 regardless
of how remote.

Attestation
Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Our management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting
firm pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that permanently exempted smaller reporting companies from the auditor attestation requirement.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

An
evaluation was performed under the supervision of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial

Committees
of our Board of Directors

Our
securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our Board members be independent and we are
not currently otherwise subject to any law
 rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our Board of Directors include
&ldquo;independent&rdquo; directors
 nor are we required to establish or maintain an Audit Committee or other committee of our
Board of Directors.

We
have not established any committees
 including an Audit Committee
 a Compensation Committee or a Nominating Committee
 any committee
performing a similar function. The functions of those committees are being undertaken by Board of Directors as a whole. Because
we have only three directors
 none of whom are independent
 we believe that the establishment of these committees would be more
form over substance.

We
do not have a policy regarding the consideration of any director candidates which may be recommended by our stockholders
 including
the minimum qualifications for director candidates
 nor has our Board of Directors established a process for identifying and evaluating
director nominees. We have not adopted a policy regarding the handling of any potential recommendation of director candidates
by our stockholders
 including the procedures to be followed. Our Board has not considered or adopted any of these policies as
we have never received a recommendation from any stockholder for any candidate to serve on our Board of Directors. Given our relative
size and lack of directors and officers insurance coverage
 we do not anticipate that any of our stockholders will make such a
recommendation in the near future. While there have been no nominations of additional directors proposed
 in the event such a
proposal is made
 all members of our Board will participate in the consideration of director nominees. In considering a director
nominee
 it is likely that our Board will consider the professional and/or educational background of any nominee with a view towards
how this person might bring a different viewpoint or experience to our Board.

None
of our directors is an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert&rdquo; within the meaning of Item 401(e) of Regulation S-K. In
general
 an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert&rdquo; is an individual member of the audit committee or Board of Directors
who:



    
    
understands
    generally U.S. GAAP and financial statements


    
    
is
    able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates
 accruals and reserves


    
    
has
    experience preparing
 auditing
 analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our
    financial statements


    
    
understands
    internal controls over financial reporting
 and

    
    
understands
    audit committee functions.


Indemnification
of Directors and Officers

Section
145 of the Delaware Corporation Law provides in relevant parts as follows:

(1)
A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened
pending
 or completed action
 suit
 or proceeding
 whether civil
 criminal
 administrative
 or investigative (other than an action
by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director
 officer
 employee
 or agent of the
corporation
 or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director
 officer
 employee
 or agent of another corporation
partnership
 joint venture
 trust
 or other enterprise
 against expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees)
 judgments
 fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action
 suit
 or proceeding if
he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation
and
 with respect to any criminal action or proceeding
 had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination
of any action
 suit
 or proceeding by judgment
 order
 settlement
 conviction
 or on a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent
shall not
 of itself
 create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation
 and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding
 had reasonable
cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

(2)
A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened
pending
 or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that he is or was a director
 officer
 employee
 or agent of the corporation
 or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director
 officer
 employee
 or agent of another corporation
 partnership
 joint venture
 trust
 or other enterprise
against expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement
of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim
 issue
 or matter as to which such
person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the corporation unless
and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine on application that
 despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case
 such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity
for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.

(3)
To the extent that a director
 officer
 employee
 or agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action
 suit
 or proceeding referred to in (1) or (2) of this subsection
 or in defense of any claim
 issue or
matter therein
 he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) actually and reasonably incurred by
him in connection therewith.


    
    


(4)
The indemnification provided by this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification
may be entitled under any bylaws
 agreement
 vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise
 both as to action in
his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office
 and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director
 officer
 employee
 or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs
 executors
 and administrators
of such a person.

The
foregoing discussion of indemnification merely summarizes certain aspects of indemnification provisions and is limited by reference
to the above discussed sections of the Delaware Corporation Law.

The
Company&rsquo;s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the Company &ldquo;may indemnify&rdquo; to the full extent
of its power to do so
 all directors
 officers
 employees
 and/or agents. It is anticipated that the Company will indemnify its
officer and director to the full extent permitted by the above-quoted statute.

Insofar
as indemnification by the Company for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to officers and directors
of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise
 the Company is aware that in the opinion of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;)
 such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities
Act and is
 therefore
 unenforceable.

Family
Relationships

There
are no family relationships between or among any of our directors or executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by us to
become directors or executive officers.

Employment
Agreements

We
have no written employment agreements or other formal compensation agreements with our officers or directors.

Compensation
of Directors

We
have not established standard compensation arrangements for our directors and the compensation payable to each individual for
their service on our Board is determined from time to time by our Board of Directors based upon the amount of time expended by
each of the directors on our behalf. During the 2017 fiscal year
 none of our directors received any compensation specifically
for their services as a director.

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

We
have no compensation committee of our board of directors
 and during the year ended December 31
 2018
 our directors and officers
participated in deliberations of our board of directors regarding officer compensation. During the year ended December 31
 2018
no executive officer of our Company (i) served as a member of the compensation committee (or other committee performing equivalent
functions or
 in the absence of any such committee
 the entire board of directors) of another entity
 one of whose executive officers

 (ii) served as a director of another entity

of directors

Narrative
Disclosure of Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to the Company&rsquo;s Risk Management

We
believe that our compensation policies and practices for all employees and other individual service providers
 including executive
officers
 do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.

SECURITY
    OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS


The
following table sets forth information regarding beneficial ownership of our capital stock by:



    
    
each
    person who is known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding voting stock;

    
    
each
    director;

    
    
each
    named executive officer; and

    
    
all
    of our current executive officers and directors as a group.


The
following table is based upon information supplied by to us by our officers
 directors and certain principal stockholders. We
have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership
of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. In addition
the rules include shares of common stock that the person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days
 including
common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise or conversion of warrants or other convertible instruments that are either immediately
exercisable/convertible or exercisable/convertible on or before May 24
 2018
 which is 60 days after March 25
 2018. These shares
are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding those options or warrants for the purpose of computing
the percentage ownership of that person
 but they are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership
of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated
 the persons or entities identified in this table have sole voting and investment
power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them
 subject to applicable community property laws.

 incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;). If an incentive award granted under the 2017 Plan expires
 terminates
 is unexercised or
is forfeited
 or if any shares are surrendered to us in connection with the exercise of an incentive award
 the shares subject
to such award and the surrendered shares will become available for further awards under the 2017 Plan.


    
    


Administration
&#8213; 
 or the Board of Directors in the absence of such a committee
will administer the 2017 Plan. Subject to the terms of the 2017 Plan
 the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors has
complete authority and discretion to determine the terms upon which awards may be granted under the 2017 Plan.

Grants
&#8213; 
 incentive stock options
 restricted
stock awards
 restricted stock units
 performance grants intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code and stock appreciation
rights
 as described below:



    
    
Options
    granted under the 2017 Plan entitle the grantee
 upon exercise
 to purchase up to a specified number of shares from us at
    a specified exercise price per share. The exercise price for shares of Common Stock covered by an option generally cannot
    be less than the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant unless agreed to otherwise at the time of the grant.
    In addition
 in the case of an incentive stock option granted to an employee who
 at the time the incentive stock option is
    granted
 owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or
    subsidiary
 the per share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of
    grant.

    
    
    

    
    
Restricted
    stock awards and restricted stock units may be awarded on terms and conditions established by the compensation committee
    which may include performance conditions for restricted stock awards and the lapse of restrictions on the achievement of one
    or more performance goals for restricted stock units.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors may make performance grants
 each of which will contain performance goals
    for the award
 including the performance criteria
 the target and maximum amounts payable
 and other terms and conditions.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    2017 Plan authorizes the granting of stock awards. The Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors will establish the
    number of shares of our common stock to be awarded (subject to the aggregate limit established under the 2017 Plan upon the
    number of shares of our common stock that may be awarded or sold under the 2017 Plan) and the terms applicable to each award
    including performance restrictions.

    
    
    

    
    
Stock
    appreciation rights (&ldquo;SARs&rdquo;) entitle the participant to receive a distribution in an amount not to exceed the
    number of shares of Common Stock subject to the portion of the SAR exercised multiplied by the difference between the market
    price of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR and the market price of a share of Common Stock on the
    date of grant of the SAR.


Duration
Amendment
 and Termination &#8213; 
 suspend or terminate the 2017 Plan without
stockholder approval or ratification at any time or from time to time. No change may be made that increases the total number of
shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to incentive awards or reduces the minimum exercise price for options or
exchange of options for other incentive awards
 unless such change is authorized by our stockholders within one year of such change.
Unless sooner terminated
 the 2017 Plan would terminate ten years after it is adopted.

In
December 2017
 the Company issued 1
240
000 shares of its common stock under the 2017 Plan to a certain consultant in settlement
of amounts owed by the Company for services provided by such consultant. As of December 31
 2018
 other than such issuance
 no
other awards or shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock have been issued under the 2017 Plan.

CERTAIN
    RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE


The
following includes a summary of transactions since January 1
 2017 to which we have been a party
 in which the amount involved
in the transaction exceeded $120
000
 and in which any of our directors
 executive officers or
 to our knowledge
 beneficial owners
of more than 5% of our capital stock or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had or will have a
direct or indirect material interest
 other than equity and other compensation arrangement
 which are described above under &ldquo;Executive
Compensation.&rdquo;

We
believe that all purchases from or transactions with affiliated parties were on terms and at prices substantially similar to those
available from unaffiliated third parties.

 our CEO
 President
 Treasurer and Interim CFO
 has provided an unsecured credit
line to the Company

 2018 the current balance is $25
693.

We
believe that each reported transaction and relationship is on terms that are at least as fair to us as would be expected if those
transactions were negotiated with third parties.

The
Sn&ouml;bar Trust

The
Snobar Trust (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;) a California Trust formed on June 1
 2013. Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is the trustor and sole
beneficiary of Trust. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge
 who is the father of Shannon
Masjedi
 who is the Company&rsquo;s President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Interim Chief Financial Officer
 Treasurer
 Secretary
and majority stockholder . So long as the trustor is in existence
 on demand of the trustor or the beneficiary
 the trustee shall
distribute to the trustor any or all of the property contained in the beneficiary. Subject to the terms of the Trust
 the trustor
may remove any acting trustee
 or designate one or more successor trustees. Any trustee may resign at any time. The Trust shall
terminate upon the earlier of (i) withdrawal or distribution of all assets from the Trust or the date upon which the trustor ceases
to be in existence. As of the date of this annual report
 the Trust owns 100% of the shares of IPIC and its liquor licenses
 permitting
IPIC to sell its product to distributors
 with all income
 expense
 gains and losses rolling up to the Trust. Sn&ouml;bar Holdings
also owns 99.9% of the shares of MGD
 which is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services.
As a result of the foregoing
 Sn&ouml;bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of all assets
 liabilities and any income received
from the business of the Trust and IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD. The Trust and IPIC are considered
variable interest entities.

There
have been no other related party transactions
 or any other transactions or relationships required to be disclosed pursuant to
Item 404 of Regulation S-K.


    
    


With
regard to any future related party transaction
 we plan to fully disclose any and all related party transactions
 including
 but
not limited to
 the following:



    
    
disclose
    such transactions in prospectuses where required;

    
    
disclose
    in any and all filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 where required;

    
    
obtain
    disinterested directors&rsquo; consent; and

    
    
obtain
    shareholder consent where required.


Indemnification
Agreements

Our
Bylaws provide that none of our officers or directors shall be personally liable for any obligations of our Company or for any
duties or obligations arising out of any acts or conduct of said officer or director performed for or on behalf of our Company
including without limitation
 acts of negligence or contributory negligence. In addition
 our Bylaws provide that we shall indemnify
and hold harmless each person and their heirs and administrators who shall serve at any time hereafter as a director or officer
of our Company from and against any and all claims
 judgments and liabilities to which such persons shall become subject by reason
of their having heretofore or hereafter been a director or officer of our Company
 or by reason of any action alleged to have
heretofore or hereafter taken or omitted to have been taken by him or her as such director or officer
 and that we shall reimburse
each such person for all legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with any such claim
 judgment
or liability
 including our power to defend such persons from all suits or claims as provided for under the provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law; provided
 however
 that no such persons shall be indemnified against
 or be reimbursed for
any expense incurred in connection with any claim or liability arising out of his (or her) own willful misconduct. In addition
in the future
 we may enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers and some of our executives may have
certain indemnification rights arising under their employment agreements with us. We believe that these bylaw provisions and indemnification
agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers.

The
limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our Bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against
our directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors
and officers
 even though an action
 if successful
 might benefit us and our stockholders. A stockholder&rsquo;s investment may
be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification
provisions.

Policies
and Procedures for Transactions with Related Persons

We
have not yet adopted a written related-person transactions policy that sets forth our policies and procedures regarding the identification
review
 consideration and oversight of &ldquo;related-person transactions.&rdquo;

Director
Independence

We
are not subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements
that a majority of the board of directors be &ldquo;independent&rdquo; and
 as a result
 we are not at this time required to have
our board of directors comprised of a majority of &ldquo;independent directors.&rdquo; Our board of directors has determined that
neither of the members of our board of directors qualifies as an &ldquo;independent&rdquo; director under Nasdaq&rsquo;s definition
of independence.

Our
board of directors acts as the audit committee and we currently have no separate committees. Due to the small size of our board
of directors
 we believe that currently it is appropriate and most efficient for our entire board of directors to execute the
functions that a separate audit committee
 compensation committee and nominating committee would typically perform.

Audit
Fees




 2018:

We
did not pay any other fees as specified in Item 9(e) of Schedule 14A.

Pre-Approval
Policies and Procedures

We
do not currently have a separate audit committee. Our board of directors is responsible for the pre-approval of all audits and
permitted non-audit services to be performed for our Company by the independent auditors. The fees paid to the independent auditors
that are shown in the chart above for 2018 and 2017 were approved by our board of directors in accordance with the procedures
described below.

Our
board of directors reviews and approves all audit and non-audit services proposed to be provided
 other than de minimis non-audit
services which may instead by preapproved in accordance with applicable SEC rules.

There
were no audit or non-audit services provided to us for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 that were not approved by our
board of directors. Our board of directors determined that the services rendered by Dylan Floyd Accounting &amp; Consulting are
compatible with maintaining their independence as our independent auditors.

&#13;Inc. (the &amp;#8220;Company
&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;we
&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;us&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;our&amp;#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the&#13;state of Delaware on October 3
 1986
 under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12
 1991
 the Company changed its name to American&#13;Eagle Group
 Inc. On October 22
 2012
 the Company changed its name to &amp;#8220;Pacific Ventures Group

 Inc. (&amp;#8220;Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings&amp;#8221;)
 which was treated&#13;as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. On August 14
 2015
 the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the &amp;#8220;Share&#13;Exchange Agreement&amp;#8221;) with Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings
 pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding&#13;shares of Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings&amp;#8217; Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22
500
000 restricted shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;common stock
 while simultaneously issuing 2
500
000 restricted shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock to certain other persons

 Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings became the Company&amp;#8217;s wholly owned operating subsidiary and the business of Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings&#13;became the Company&amp;#8217;s sole business operations and MAS Global Distributors
 Inc.
 a California corporation (&amp;#8220;MGD&amp;#8221;)

&#13;the Company operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries
 which marketed and underwrote specialized property&#13;and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace. However
 in 1997
 after selling several of its divisions

 the Company&amp;#8217;s business operations changed&#13;to that of Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are solely that of Sn&amp;#246;bar&#13;Holdings and its affiliates and subsidiaries comprising of Sn&amp;#246;bar Trust 
 International Production Impex Corporation
 a California&#13;corporation (&amp;#8220;IPIC&amp;#8221;) 

 2013. Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of&#13;Sn&amp;#246;bar Trust
 a California trust (&amp;#8220;Trust&amp;#8221;)
 which was formed in June 1
 2013. The current trustee that holds legal&#13;title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge
 the father of Shannon Masjedi
 the Company&amp;#8217;s President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Interim&#13;Chief Financial Officer
 Treasurer
 and majority stockholder. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of IPIC
 which was formed on August&#13;2
 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops
 and holds all of the rights to the liquor licenses&#13;to sell such products and trade names &amp;#8220;Sn&amp;#246;bar&amp;#8221;. As such
 the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its&#13;liquor licenses
 permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors
 with all income
 expense
 gains and losses rolling up to&#13;the Trust
 of which Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings is the sole beneficiary. Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MGD. MGD&#13;is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services. As a result of the foregoing
 Sn&amp;#246;bar&#13;Holdings is the primary beneficiary of all assets

 Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of&#13;Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings&amp;#8217; management is that Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly&#13;impact the VIE&amp;#8217;s activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC)
 and the obligation to absorb losses&#13;of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially&#13;be significant to the VIE&amp;#8217;s economic performance
 it was therefore concluded by management that Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings is the&#13;primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such
 the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Sn&amp;#246;bar&#13;Holdings since the inception of the Trust
 in the case of the Trust
 and since the inception of Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings

 a California Corporation. San Diego Farmers Outlet was started in&#13;over thirty-five years ago to provide primarily restaurants customers in southern California&amp;#8217;s three largest counties with&#13;quality food and produce

 Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings and its subsidiaries
 in which Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings has a&#13;controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities (&amp;#8220;VIE&amp;#8221;) provisions of ASC&#13;810

&#13;liabilities

 a VIE is a&#13;corporation
 partnership
 limited-liability corporation
 trust
 or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold&#13;assets that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated&#13;financial support
 (2) has a group of equity owners that is unable to make significant decisions about its activities
 (3) has&#13;a group of equity owners that does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations&#13;or (4) the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity
&#13;their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity
 or both and substantially all of the entity&amp;#8217;s activities&#13;(for example

 contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (a variable interest holder)&#13;that has both of the following characteristics: a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the&#13;VIE&amp;#8217;s economic performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the&#13;VIE

 beginning after December 15
 2015. Early application&#13;is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of&#13;operations

 FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2015-06
 &amp;#8220;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership&#13;Dropdown Transactions&amp;#8221;
 which specifies that
 for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class&#13;method
 the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should be allocated entirely&#13;to the general partner. In that circumstance
 the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically&#13;the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction.&#13;Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for&#13;purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15
 2015

 FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2014-10
 &amp;#8220;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
&#13;Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&amp;#8221;. The update removes all incremental&#13;financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting&#13;Standards Codification. In addition
 the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate&#13;one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties&#13;related to the company&amp;#8217;s current activities. Furthermore
 the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities&#13;in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation&#13;analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development&#13;stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014

 FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2014-12
 &amp;#8220;Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the&#13;Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&amp;#8221;. The amendments&#13;in this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide&#13;that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that&#13;a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance&#13;condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that&#13;affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim&#13;periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments&#13;in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards&#13;with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements&#13;and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
 the cumulative effect of applying this Update&#13;as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to&#13;the opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight&#13;in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results&#13;of operations

&#13;the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on &amp;#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &amp;#8211; Disclosure of&#13;Uncertainties about an Entity&amp;#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#8221;. Currently
 there is no guidance in GAAP about&#13;management&amp;#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as&#13;a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the&#13;amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management&#13;to assess an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that&#13;are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
&#13;(2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating&#13;effect of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration&#13;of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated

 the FASB&#13;established the Accounting Standards Codification (&amp;#8220;Codification&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;ASC&amp;#8221;) as the source of authoritative&#13;accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements&#13;in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&amp;#8220;GAAP&amp;#8221;). Rules and interpretive releases&#13;of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &amp;#8220;SEC&amp;#8221;) issued under authority of federal securities laws are also sources&#13;of GAAP for SEC registrants. Existing GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the Codification

 FASB issued&#13;Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2015-03
 &amp;#8220;Interest &amp;#8211; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):&#13;Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs&amp;#8221;
 to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt&#13;issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying&#13;amount of that debt liability
 consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance&#13;for debt issuance costs. For public companies
 the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15
 2015

 FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2015-04
 &amp;#8220;Compensation &amp;#8211; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an&#13;Employer&amp;#8217;s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets&amp;#8221;
 which permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets&#13;and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity&amp;#8217;s fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently&#13;from year to year. The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15
 2015

 FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2015-05
 &amp;#8220;Intangibles &amp;#8211; Goodwill and Other &amp;#8211; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&amp;#8217;s&#13;Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement&amp;#8221;
 which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing&#13;arrangement includes a software license. If such includes a software license
 then the customer should account for the software&#13;license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include&#13;a software license
 the customer should account for it as a service contract. For public business entities
 the ASU is effective&#13;for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015. Early application&#13;is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of&#13;operations

 FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2015-06
 &amp;#8220;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown&#13;Transactions&amp;#8221;
 which specifies that
 for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method
&#13;the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should be allocated entirely to the&#13;general partner. In that circumstance
 the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically the&#13;earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative&#13;disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes&#13;of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after&#13;December 15
 2015

 FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2014-10
 &amp;#8220;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including&#13;an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&amp;#8221;. The update removes all incremental financial&#13;reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards&#13;Codification. In addition
 the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that&#13;an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties related to&#13;the company&amp;#8217;s current activities. Furthermore
 the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities in&#13;Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation analysis
&#13;consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development stage. The&#13;update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014

 FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2014-12
 &amp;#8220;Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms&#13;of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&amp;#8221;. The amendments in this&#13;ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that&#13;a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance&#13;target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.&#13;A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect&#13;vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods&#13;within those annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments&#13;in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards&#13;with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements&#13;and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
 the cumulative effect of applying this Update&#13;as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to&#13;the opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight&#13;in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results&#13;of operations

 the FASB&#13;issued ASU 2014-15 on &amp;#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &amp;#8211; Disclosure of Uncertainties&#13;about an Entity&amp;#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#8221;. Currently
 there is no guidance in GAAP about management&amp;#8217;s&#13;responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern or&#13;to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments are intended&#13;to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity&amp;#8217;s&#13;ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing&#13;standards. Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every&#13;reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&amp;#8217;s&#13;plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&amp;#8217;s&#13;plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated

the Company operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries
 which marketed and underwrote specialized property

formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7
 2013. Sn&#246;bar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of
Sn&#246;bar Trust
 a California trust (&#8220;Trust&#8221;)
 which was formed in June 1
 2013. The current trustee that holds legal
title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge
 the father of Shannon Masjedi

 Chief Executive Officer
 Interim
Chief Financial Officer
 Treasurer
 and majority stockholder. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of IPIC
 which was formed on August

 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops
 and holds all of the rights to the liquor licenses
to sell such products and trade names &#8220;Sn&#246;bar&#8221;. As such
 the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its
liquor licenses

 with all income
 expense
 gains and losses rolling up to
the Trust
 of which Sn&#246;bar Holdings is the sole beneficiary. Sn&#246;bar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MGD. MGD
is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services. As a result of the foregoing
 Sn&#246;bar
Holdings is the primary beneficiary of all assets
 liabilities and any income received from the business of the Trust and IPIC
through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD.

the Trust and IPIC. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;)
810
 Sn&#246;bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of
Sn&#246;bar Holdings&#8217; management is that Sn&#246;bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly
impact the VIE&#8217;s activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC)
 and the obligation to absorb losses
of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially
be significant to the VIE&#8217;s economic performance
 it was therefore concluded by management that Sn&#246;bar Holdings is the
primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such
 the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Sn&#246;bar
Holdings since the inception of the Trust

 non-controlling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements.


 a VIE is a
corporation
 partnership
 limited-liability corporation

 or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold
assets that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated
financial support
 (2) has a group of equity owners that is unable to make significant decisions about its activities
 (3) has
a group of equity owners that does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations
or (4) the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity

VIE&#8217;s economic performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the
VIE
 or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.


that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. If the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE) and
the VIE are under common control
 the primary beneficiary shall initially measure the assets

interests of the VIE at amounts at which they are carried in the accounts of the reporting entity that controls the VIE (or would
be carried if the reporting entity issued financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles).
ASC 810 also requires disclosures about VIEs in which the variable interest holder is not required to consolidate but in which
it has a significant variable interest.

Principles of
Consolidation


financial statements include the Company
 Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 San Diego Farmers Outlet
 MGD
 IPIC and the Trust
 which was established
to hold IPIC
 which in turn holds liquor licenses. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated during consolidation. See the
discussion in Note 1 above for variable interest entity treatment of the Trust and IPIC.




of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.




generally recognized in accordance with the SAB 104 Public Company Guidance
 when an agreement exists and price is determinable
the products are shipped to the customers or services are rendered
 net of discounts
 returns and allowance and collectability
is reasonably assured. We are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing
the revenue. In the instances in which we have received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue
 we include
the amounts in deferred or unearned revenue on our consolidated balance sheet.




amounts are received pursuant to agreements or contracts and may only be used in the conduct of specified transactions or the related
services are yet to be performed. These amounts are recorded as unearned or deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue in the
year/period the related expenses are incurred or services are performed. As at December 31
 2018
 the Company has $0 in deferred
revenue. This is comparable to deferred revenue balance of $15
042 as of December 31
 2017
 which was as a result of prepayment
by two of its customers.

Handling Costs


shipping costs are all recorded as operating expenses for all periods presented.




in a variety of disputes
 claims
 and proceedings concerning its business operations and certain liabilities. We determine whether
an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated.
We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our
views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters
 which involves an analysis
of potential results
 assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters
cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual

any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts
 they could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations

 2018
 the Company has $0 in disputed liabilities on its balance sheet.

The allowance is calculated based upon the level of past due accounts and the relationship with and financial status of our customers.
As of December 31
 2018
 the Company wrote off $3

on-hand are regularly reviewed
 and where necessary
 reserves for excess and unusable inventories are recorded. Inventory consists
of finished goods and includes ice cream
 popsicles and the related packaging materials. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company had
$160
858 of inventory assets consisting of San Diego Farmers Outlet
 Inc.&#8217;s fresh produce and food products. As of December
31
 2017
 the Company has $0 in inventories.




provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the
difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date
of enactment.

Net Income/(Loss)
Per Common Share


per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net income/(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. The Company has no potentially dilutive securities. Accordingly
 basic and dilutive income/(loss)
per common share are the same.

Property and
Equipment


are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and includes expenditures that substantially increase the useful lives of existing
property and equipment. Maintenance
 repairs
 and minor renovations are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of property
and equipment
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain
or loss is included in the results of operations. The Company provides for depreciation of property and equipment using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease
 as appropriate. The estimated useful lives are as follows: vehicles
five years; office furniture and equipment
 three to fifteen years; equipment
 three years.

maintains cash balances at financial institutions within the United States which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to limits of approximately $250
000. The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank
accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts.

Critical Accounting
Policies


revenue recognition and the valuation of accounts receivable
 allowance for doubtful accounts
 and inventory and reserves as its
significant accounting policies. Some of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the
reported amounts in the Company&#8217;s financial statements.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements


 the
FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;Codification&#8221; or &#8220;ASC&#8221;) as the source of authoritative
accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). Rules and interpretive releases
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) issued under authority of federal securities laws are also sources
of GAAP for SEC registrants. Existing GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the Codification
 and accordingly the
change did not impact our financial statements. The ASC does change the way the guidance is organized and presented.


 FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2015-03
 &#8220;Interest &#8211; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs&#8221;
 to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt
issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability
 consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance
for debt issuance costs. For public companies
 the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted.


 FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-04
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date
of an Employer&#8217;s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets&#8221;
 which permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan
assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity&#8217;s fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient
consistently from year to year. The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted.


 FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-05
 &#8220;Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other &#8211; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s
Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement&#8221;
 which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license. If such includes a software license
 then the customer should account for the software
license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include
a software license
 the customer should account for it as a service contract. For public business entities
 the ASU is effective
for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015. Early application
is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of
operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-06
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership
Dropdown Transactions&#8221;
 which specifies that
 for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class
method
 the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should be allocated entirely
to the general partner. In that circumstance
 the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically
the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction.
Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for
purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted.


 FASB
issued ASU No. 2014-10
 &#8220;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#8221;. The update removes all incremental
financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification. In addition
 the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate
one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties
related to the company&#8217;s current activities. Furthermore
 the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities
in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation
analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development
stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 including interim periods therein.
Early application is permitted with the first annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity&#8217;s financial
statements have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Our company adopted
this pronouncement.


 FASB
issued ASU No. 2014-12
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the
Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&#8221;. The amendments
in this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide
that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that
a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance
condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that
affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim
periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments
in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards
with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements
and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
 the cumulative effect of applying this Update
as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to
the opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight
in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results
of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on &#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &#8211; Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221;. Currently
 there is no guidance in GAAP about
management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as
a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the
amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management
to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that
are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
(2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating
effect of management&#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration
of management&#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and
(6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be
issued).

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]








    
    



financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements
 the Company has incurred a net loss of $1
547
598 for the year ended December 31
 2018 and has an accumulated
deficit of $7
499
045 as at December 31
 2018.


a going concern
 the Company will need
 among other things
 additional capital resources. The Company is significantly dependent
upon its ability
 and will continue to attempt
 to secure equity and/or additional debt financing. There are no assurances that
the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.


financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets
 or the
amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. These audited consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.








recognized in accordance with the SAB 104 Public Company Guidance
 when an agreement exists and price is determinable
 the products
are shipped to the customers or services are rendered
 net of discounts
 returns and allowance and collectability is reasonably
assured. We are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue.
In the instances in which we have received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue
 we include the amounts

are received pursuant to agreements or contracts and may only be used in the conduct of specified transactions or the related
services are yet to be performed. These amounts are recorded as unearned or deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue in
the year/period the related expenses are incurred or services are performed. As at December 31
 2018
 the Company has $0 in deferred
revenue. This is comparable to deferred revenue balance of $15
042 as of December 31
 2017
 which was as a result of prepayment
by two of its customers.





Shipping and Handling
Costs


costs are all recorded as operating expenses for all periods presented.








in a variety of disputes
 claims
 and proceedings concerning its business operations and certain liabilities. We determine whether
an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated.
We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our
views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters
 which involves an analysis
of potential results
 assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters
cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual
 or should
any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts
 they could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations
 cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination
judgment or settlement occurs. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company has $31
858 in disputed liabilities on its balance sheet.








highly liquid instruments with original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31
 2018
 the
Company had a cash balance of $151

 compared to $69 at December 31
 2017.








stated at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts. The allowance
is calculated based upon the level of past due accounts and the relationship with and financial status of our customers. As of
December 31
 2018
 the Company wrote off $3
820 of bad debt expense. The Company did not write off any during the year ended December

 2017.








at the lower of cost or market value. Cost has been determined using the first-in
 first-out method. Inventory quantities on-hand
are regularly reviewed
 and where necessary
 reserves for excess and unusable inventories are recorded. Inventory consists of
finished goods and includes ice cream
 popsicles and the related packaging materials. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company had
$160
858 of inventory assets consisting of San Diego Farmers Outlet
 Inc.&#8217;s fresh produce and food products. As of December
31
 2017
 the Company has $0 in inventories.








on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the
difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date
of enactment.





Net Income/(Loss) Per
Common Share


per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net income/(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. The Company has no potentially dilutive securities. Accordingly
 basic and dilutive income/(loss)
per common share are the same.





Property and
Equipment


are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and includes expenditures that substantially increase the useful lives of existing
property and equipment. Maintenance
 repairs
 and minor renovations are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of property
and equipment
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain
or loss is included in the results of operations. The Company provides for depreciation of property and equipment using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease
 as appropriate. The estimated useful lives are as follows: vehicles
five years; office furniture and equipment
 three to fifteen years; equipment
 three years.

 accounts payable
 and accrued expenses
are representative of their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.





Concentration of Credit
Risk


that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company
maintains cash balances at financial institutions within the United States which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to limits of approximately $250
000. The Company has not experienced any losses with regard
to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts.





Critical Accounting
Policies


revenue recognition and the valuation of accounts receivable
 allowance for doubtful accounts
 and inventory and reserves as its
significant accounting policies. Some of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the
reported amounts in the Company&#8217;s financial statements.








 the FASB
established the Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;Codification&#8221; or &#8220;ASC&#8221;) as the source of authoritative
accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). Rules and interpretive releases
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) issued under authority of federal securities laws are also sources
of GAAP for SEC registrants. Existing GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the Codification
 and accordingly the
change did not impact our financial statements. The ASC does change the way the guidance is organized and presented.


 FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2015-03
 &#8220;Interest &#8211; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs&#8221;
 to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt
issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability
 consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance
for debt issuance costs. For public companies
 the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted.


 FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-04
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an
Employer&#8217;s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets&#8221;
 which permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets
and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity&#8217;s fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently
from year to year. The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted.


 FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-05
 &#8220;Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other &#8211; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s
Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement&#8221;
 which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license. If such includes a software license
 then the customer should account for the software
license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include
a software license
 the customer should account for it as a service contract. For public business entities
 the ASU is effective
for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015. Early application
is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of
operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-06
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown
Transactions&#8221;
 which specifies that
 for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method
the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should be allocated entirely to the
general partner. In that circumstance
 the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically the
earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative
disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes
of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted.


 FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-10
 &#8220;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including
an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#8221;. The update removes all incremental financial
reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification. In addition
 the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that
an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties related to
the company&#8217;s current activities. Furthermore
 the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities in
Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation analysis
consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development stage. The
update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 including interim periods therein. Early
application is permitted with the first annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity&#8217;s financial statements
have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Our company adopted this pronouncement.


 FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-12
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms
of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&#8221;. The amendments in this
ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that
a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance
target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect
vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods
within those annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments
in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards
with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements
and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
 the cumulative effect of applying this Update
as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to
the opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight
in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results
of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2014-15 on &#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &#8211; Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221;. Currently
 there is no guidance in GAAP about management&#8217;s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern or
to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments are intended
to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity&#8217;s
ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing
standards. Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every
reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s
plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s
plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment
for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).
