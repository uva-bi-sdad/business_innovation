 which requires management to make significant judgments
and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. We base these significant
judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions we believe to be reasonable based upon information
presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur
 as additional information is obtained and as our operating
environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they
became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different assumptions

differ from those estimates.

without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) is accumulated and communicated to the
issuer's management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
 regardless of how remote.


of the Company&rsquo;s senior management
 consisting of the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and financial officer and the Company&rsquo;s
principal accounting officer
 the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered
by this report (the &ldquo;Evaluation Date&rdquo;). Based on this evaluation

Management&rsquo;s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting


 Inc. is responsible
for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f))
under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.


 even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In evaluating the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting
 our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation
 our officers concluded that
during the period covered by this annual report
 our internal controls over financial reporting were not operating effectively.


 the Company does not
have an audit committee and is not currently obligated to have one. Management does not believe that the lack of an audit committee
is a material weakness.




an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting
as such report is not required for non-accelerated filers.

committees in the future. We do not have a nominating committee or a nominating committee charter. Further

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.
