FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This

&rdquo;
&ldquo;estimates
&rdquo; &ldquo;expects
&rdquo; &ldquo;intends
&rdquo; &ldquo;plans&rdquo; and &ldquo;believes
&rdquo; among others
generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our management&rsquo;s expectations
and assumptions about future events as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 which are inherently subject to uncertainties
risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations
beliefs or intentions regarding our product offerings
 business
 financial condition
 results of operations
 strategies or prospects.
You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current
matters. Rather
 forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events
 activities
 trends or results as of the
date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred
 these statements are inherently
subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed
or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from
the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and
reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance. We undertake no obligation
to update
 and we do not have a policy of updating or revising

PART
I

ITEM
1. BUSINESS.

Fah
Mai Holdings
 Inc. (&ldquo;Fah Mai&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
 formerly known as Finch Street Acquisition Corporation
was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 22
 2016
 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate
undertaking
 including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and acquisitions.

The
Company was formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of
securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The
Company registered its common stock on a Form 10 registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) and Rule 12(g) thereof. The Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission periodic
and current reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act
 including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports Form 10-K.

On
February 27
 2017
 the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders
 redeeming shares of existing
shareholders
 electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
In connection with the change of control
 the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
change of the Company&rsquo;s name from Finch Street Acquisition Corporation to Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc.

As
of December 31
 2017
 the Company had not generated revenues and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception.
During the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company sustained net loss of $35
687
 and at December 31
 2017
had an accumulated deficit of $43
249.

The
Company&rsquo;s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue
as a going concern. At present
 the Company has no operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent
upon financial support from its stockholders
 its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to
successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company.

There
is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.

The
Company intends to acquire or otherwise combine with Fah Mai Holdings Co.
 Ltd.
 a private company organized under the laws of
the Thailand (&ldquo;Fah Mai Thailand&rdquo;). Fah Mai Thailand is an early-stage company whose current business is in acquiring
holding and divesting alternative assets
 specifically rare whisky and similar commodities.

Louis
Haseman
 the sole officer and director of the Company
 has an agreement with Tiber Creek Corporation
 which assists companies
in becoming public companies and assists companies with introductions to the financial community. The former President of the
Company is the sole officer and director of Tiber Creek Corporation. The services provided by Tiber Creek to Mr. Haseman included
using the Company as a vehicle for becoming public.


 2017
the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Fah Mai Holdings Limited and Platinum Cask Limited
 both UK companies from Louis
Haseman. These entities are part of the merger and acquisition plan to run operations and hold and manage whisky inventories.

2. PROPERTIES.

The
Company has no properties and at this time has no agreements to acquire any properties. The Company currently uses the offices

PART

ITEM
5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&rsquo;S COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

There
is currently no public market for the Company&rsquo;s securities.

At
such time as it qualifies
 the Company may choose to apply for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.

The
OTC Bulletin Board is a dealer-driven quotation service. Unlike the Nasdaq Stock Market
 companies cannot directly apply to be
quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
 only market makers can initiate quotes
 and quoted companies do not have to meet any quantitative
financial requirements. Any equity security of a reporting company not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or on a national securities
exchange is eligible.

As
such time as it qualifies
 the Company may choose to apply for quotation of its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In general
there is greatest liquidity for traded securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market and less on the OTC Bulletin Board. It is not possible
to predict where
 if at all
 the securities of the Company will be traded following a business combination.

Since
inception
 the Company has sold securities which were not registered as follows:


Street Acquisition Corporation) issued an aggregate of 20
000
000 common shares on formation in July 22
 2016 pro rata (10
000
000
each) to James Cassidy and James McKillop
 at a purchase price equal to $0.0001 per share
 of which all but an aggregate of 500
000
shares were contributed back to the Company and cancelled.


 2017
Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc. issued 40
000
000 shares of its common stock at par of $0.0001 per share pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933 at par representing 98.7% of the total outstanding 40
500
000 shares of common stock as part of
a change in control to Louis J. Haseman
 the current CEO of the Company.


 2017
and December 31
 2017
 the Company issued 790
970 shares of common stock to 53 individuals at $0.45 - $0.50 per
share and received $394
066 in cash. These shares were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration under Regulation
S
 as promulgated under the Securities Act
 and were sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons not involving any directed
selling efforts in the United States.

Between
January 1
 2018 and April 17
 2018
 the Company issued 277
611 shares of common stock to 15 individuals at $0.30 - $0.65 per share
and received $125
538 in cash. These shares were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration under Regulation S
 as
promulgated under the Securities Act
 and were sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons not involving any directed selling
efforts in the United States.

ITEM
6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

There
is no selected financial data required to be filed for a smaller reporting company.


    
    


ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Business
Summary

Fah
Mai Holdings
 Inc. was incorporated on July 22
 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate
undertaking
 including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and acquisitions. Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc. (&ldquo;Fah Mai&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a blank check company and qualifies as an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; as defined in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which became law in April 2012.

On
February 27
 2017
 the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders
 redeeming shares of existing
shareholders
 electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
In connection with the change of control
 the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
change of the Company&rsquo;s name from Finch Street Acquisition Corporation to Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc. Louis Haseman was then
named sole director of the Company and was named President
 Secretary and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.

Since
inception
 Fah Mai&rsquo;s operations to date of the period covered by this report have been limited to issuing shares
of common stock and filing a registration statement on Form 10 on August 9
 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended to register its class of common stock and effecting a change in control
purchasing rare and collectible whisky as inventory and acquiring two subsidiaries
 Fah Mai Holdings Limited and Platinum Cask
Limited.

Fah
Mai has no operations nor does it currently engage in any business activities generating revenues. Fah Mai&rsquo;s principal business
objective is to achieve a business combination with a target company.

The
Company intends to acquire or otherwise combine with Fah Mai Holdings Co.
 Ltd.
 a private company organized under the laws of
the Thailand (&ldquo;Fah Mai Thailand&rdquo;). Fah Mai Thailand is an early-stage company whose current business is in acquiring
holding and divesting alternative assets
 specifically rare whisky and similar commodities.

A
combination will normally take the form of a merger
 stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances
the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under
Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended.

No
assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in negotiating with its anticipated or any target company.

In
implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition
 the Company may become a party to a merger
 consolidation
 reorganization
joint venture
 licensing agreement or other arrangement with another corporation or entity.

On
the consummation of a transaction
 the present management and shareholders of the Company may no longer be in control of the Company.
In addition
 it the officer and director of the Company may
 as part of the terms of the business combination
 resign and be replaced
by one or more new officers and directors.

As
of December 31
 2017
 Fah Mai had not generated revenues and had no cash flows from operations since inception. During the
year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company sustained net loss of $35
687 and had an accumulated deficit of $43
249
at December 31
 2017.

The
Company&rsquo;s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue
as a going concern. At present
 the Company has no operations and the continuation of Fah Mai as a going concern is dependent
upon financial support from its stockholders
 its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to
successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with Fah Mai Holdings Co.
Ltd.



As
of December 31
 2017
 the Company had shareholders&rsquo; equity of $357
749 and a cash balance of $81
118. During the
year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company incurred a net loss of $35
687.


    
    


As
of December 31
 2017
 the Company has an accumulated deficit of $43
249. These matters raise substantial doubt about the
Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company&rsquo;s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its
ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations
 which it has not been able to accomplish to
date
 and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third parties.

The
Company&rsquo;s independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern. Unless the Company is able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing
 there
is a substantial doubt as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern.

Revenues
and Losses

During
the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company posted revenues of $0
 total operating expenses of $36
215
 consisting of
general and administrative expenses of $36
215
 and a net loss of $35
687.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of December 31
 2017
 the Company had cash available of $81
118.

There
is no assurance that the Company&rsquo;s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional
capital
 or if additional capital is needed
 that such funds
 if available
 will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.
Accordingly
 given the Company&rsquo;s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand
 the Company will be unable to implement its
business plans and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate revenues and profits.
The Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity
 obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other
alternative financial plans.

Discussion
of Year ended December 31
 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31
 2016

As
of December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 the Company has not generated any revenues because the Company is still in the early
stages of its development and has yet to fully implement its plans for commercialization.

During
the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company posted a net loss of $35
687 as compared to a net loss of $7
562 for the
year ended December 31
 2016. The increase in net loss resulted from the shift in the focus of the operations of the Company as
a result of a change in control of the Company.

Operating
expenses were $36
215 for the year ended December 31
 2017 as compared to $7
562 for the year ended December 31
 2016.
The increase in operating expenses resulted primarily from the shift in the focus of the operations of the Company as a result
of a change in control of the Company.

During
the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company used cash in operating activities of $45
738. During such period
 the
Company also used cash in investing activities in the amount of $266
430 by advancing funds to a related party
 and
received $394
066 in financing activities through the issuance of common stock. In contrast
 during the year ended
December 31
 2016
 the Company used cash in operating
 investing
 and financing activities of $0. The increase in cash
resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock for cash due to the shift in the focus of the operations of the
Company as a result of a change in control of the Company

As
of December 31
 2017
 the Company had $81
118 in cash. In contrast
 as of December 31
 2016
 the Company had $0 in cash.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.



    
    


Equipment
Financing

The
Company has no existing equipment financing arrangements.

Alternative
Financial Planning

The
Company has no alternative financial plans at the moment. If the Company is not able to successfully raise monies as needed through
a private placement or other securities offering (including
 but not limited to
 a primary public offering of securities)
 the
Company&rsquo;s ability to survive as a going concern and implement any part of its business plan or strategy will be severely
jeopardized.

The
Company does not anticipate that it will generate revenue sufficient to cover its planned operating expenses
 and the Company
must obtain additional financing in order to develop and implement its business plan and proposed operations. If the Company is
not successful in generating sufficient revenues and/or obtaining additional funding to develop its business plan and proposed
operations
 this could have a material adverse effect on its business
 results of operations liquidity and financial condition.

Critical
Accounting Policies


December 31
 2017
 the consolidated financial statements have been prepared and audited in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The following significant accounting policies
 which are described in Note
3 to the consolidated financial statements
 involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly
 these are
the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results
of operations.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents


all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. There were
$81
118 and $0 cash equivalents as of December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 respectively.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

In
accordance with ASC 820
 the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair
value
 and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level
1- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.

Level
2- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar
assets and liabilities in markets that are not active
 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
 and inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data.

Level
3- Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity&rsquo;s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair market
value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.


    
    


Income
Taxes

Under
ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes
&rdquo; deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31
 2017 and December
31
 2016
 there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior
to expiration.




number of shares outstanding at the date of the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
there are no potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.

9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

to change auditors and engaged Pinnacle Accountancy Group for its December 31

were no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure for the period covered by this report.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our
management
 with the participation of our prior principal executive and financial officer
 evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report (based on the
evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act) were not effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded
 processed
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission&rsquo;s rules and forms
 and (ii) is accumulated and
communicated to the Company&rsquo;s management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons
performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period
covered by the Report
 we did not have a formal audit committee and there was a lack of segregation of duties.

We
believe that a control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud
 if any
 within a company have been detected.


    
    


Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of our company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the Company&rsquo;s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management
assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2017
 the end of our fiscal year. Management based its

of the Treadway Commission (the COSO 2013 Criteria)
the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls
 process documentation
 accounting policies
 and our
overall control environment.

Based
on our assessment
 management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
 as of the end
of the fiscal year
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The management has identified
the following material weaknesses and believes that
 as of December 31
 2017
 our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; (ii) lack of personnel adequately trained in
generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (or U.S. GAAP); and (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both U.S. GAAP and SEC guidelines.
Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the above material weaknesses
are remediated. We expect to implement the following measures to remediate the material weaknesses identified
 subject to obtaining
additional financing: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk
management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company&rsquo;s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by the Company&rsquo;s registered public
accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management&rsquo;s
report in this annual report.

Inherent
limitations on effectiveness of controls

Internal
control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals
for advice and guidance
 interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles
 segregation of management duties
 scale
of organization
 and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence
and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial
reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis
 however these inherent limitations
are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though
not eliminate
 this risk. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


    
    


Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes in the Company&rsquo;s internal controls over financial reporting during its fourth fiscal quarter that materially
affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 its internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent to the period
covered by this Report and the fourth fiscal quarter
 the Company effected a change in control. New management consists of two
directors and officers who are also shareholders. Such persons maintain complete financial reporting control as the primary officers.
Such control by the primary officers is the same as was in effect prior to the change in control.

PART
III

ITEM
10. DIRECTORS
 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

The
Directors and Officers of the Company on December 31
 2017 the date of this Report were as follows:



    
    
Positions
    and Offices Held

Louis
    Haseman
    
President
    Secretary
 Chief Financial Officer &amp; Director


Management
of the Company

There
are no agreements or understandings for the officer or director to resign at the request of another person and the above-named
officer and director is not acting on behalf of nor will act at the direction of any other person.

Set
forth below are the names of the directors and officers of the Company
 all positions and offices with the Company held
 the period
during which they have served as such
 and the business experience during at least the last five years:

Louis
Joseph Haseman
 age 33
 serves as President
 Secretary
 Chief Financial Officer and sole director of the Company. From
2010 to the present
 Mr. Haseman has been the director and owner of HGT Co.
 Ltd. with two operating brands: Exotic Golf Holidays
which specializes in golf holidays located around the Indian Ocean and Quality Health Travel which specializes in medical tourism
including plastic surgery
 hip replacements and stem cell treatment. From 2011 to the present
 Mr. Haseman has served as the owner
of Sunscreen Island Co.
 Ltd. which is the exclusive importer and distributor of the Island Tribe sunscreen brand in Thailand
and the Philippines. Since 2012 to the present
 Mr. Haseman has also been part owner of Epikurean Resorts
 a luxury hotel and
resorts management and development company. From 2015-2016
 Mr. Haseman was the owner of Euro Facade Tech Thailand Co.
 Ltd.
a global containment wall and design company.

Conflicts
of Interest

There
are no binding guidelines or procedures for resolving potential conflicts of interest. Failure by management to resolve conflicts
of interest in favor of the Company could result in liability of management to the Company. However
 any attempt by shareholders
to enforce a liability of management to the Company would most likely be prohibitively expensive and time consuming.

Code
of Ethics

The
Company has not at this time adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to rules described in Regulation S-K. The Company has no operations
or business and does not receive any revenues. The adoption of an Ethical Code at this time would not serve the primary purpose
of such a code to provide a manner of conduct as the development
 execution and enforcement of such a code would be by the same
persons and only persons to whom such code applied. Furthermore
 because the Company does not have any activities
 there are activities
or transactions which would be subject to this code. If the Company enters into a business combination management will propose
adoption of a Code of Ethics.


    
    


Corporate
Governance

For
reasons similar to those described above
 the Company does not have a nominating nor audit committee of the board of directors.
At this time
 the Company has only one officer and director. The Company receives no revenues. At such time that the Company enters
into a business combination and/or has additional shareholders and a larger board of directors and commences activities
 the Company
will propose creating committees of its board of directors
 including both a nominating and an audit committee. Management of
the Company intends to review and implement
 as necessary
 procedures for shareholder nomination of members to the Company&rsquo;s
board of directors.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The
Company&rsquo;s officers and directors do not receive any compensation for services rendered to the Company
 nor have they received
such compensation in the past. The officers and directors are not accruing any compensation pursuant to any agreement with the
Company.

No
retirement
 pension
 profit sharing
 stock option or insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by the Company
for the benefit of its employees.

The
Company does not have a compensation committee for the same reasons as described above.

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

The
following table sets forth
 as of December 31
 2017 each person known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of five percent
or more of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and the director and officer of the Company. The Company does not have any compensation
plans and has not authorized any securities for future issuance. Except as noted
 the holder thereof has sole voting and investment
power with respect to the shares shown.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.

James
Cassidy and James McKillop were both formerly officers and directors of the Company and each own 250
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock
 which were issued at formation
 at a cost basis of $.0001 per share
 in exchange for services rendered. Mr. Cassidy
a partner in the law firm which acts as counsel to the Company
 provides legal services to the Company without charge.

In
February 2017
 the Company issued to Louis Haseman
 the Company&rsquo;s sole officer and director
 40
000
000 shares of its common
stock
 at a purchase price equal to $0.0001 per share
 as part of a change in control.


 2017
the Company had issued funds to a related party entity in the amount of $266
430 in anticipation of acquiring or merging the entity
with the Company. Between April 17
 2017 and December 31
 2017
 the Company received $394
066 from individuals where they had
issued 790
970 shares of common stock to 53 individuals at $0.45 - $0.50 per share. All of these proceeds have been
loaned to a related party
 Fah Mai Holdings Co.
 Ltd.
 a Thailand company formed in April 10
2017 and controlled by the majority shareholders of the Company. The Company has recorded a receivable from the related entity
on its books for these funds.

The
Company is not currently required to maintain an independent director as defined by Rule 4200 of the Nasdaq Capital Market nor
does it anticipate that it will be applying for listing of its securities on an exchange in which an independent directorship
is required. It is unlikely that the current director would be considered an independent director if it were to do so.


    
    


ITEM
14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.

The
Company has limited activities and no income. The Company&rsquo;s president has donated his time in preparation
and filing of all state and federal required taxes and reports.


KCCW Accountancy Group (KCCW) as its independent registered public accounting firm to perform the December 31
 2016 audit. KCCW
also performed the review of the quarterly report for March 31
 2017. In February 2018
 the Company made the decision to engage Pinnacle
Accountancy Group (Pinnacle) as its independent registered public accounting firm to replace KCCW. Pinnacle performed the review
of the quarterly reports for the periods ended June 30
 2017 and September 30
 2017 and has performed the audit for the period
ended December 31
 2017.

Audit
Fees

The
aggregate fees incurred in 2017 for professional services rendered by the independent registered public accounting firm for the
audits of the Company&rsquo;s annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in the Company&rsquo;s Form
10-K and Form 10-Q reports and services normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were
as follows:

The
Company does not currently have an audit committee serving and as a result its board of directors performs the duties of an audit
committee. The board of directors will evaluate and approve in advance
 the scope and cost of the engagement of an auditor before
the auditor renders audit and non-audit services. The Company does not rely on pre-approval policies and procedures.

NOTE
1 &ndash; DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Nature
of Operations


 Inc. (formerly Finch Street
Acquisition Corporation) (&ldquo;Fah Mai&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated on July 22
 2016 under the laws
of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking
 including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and acquisitions.
The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares
to its original shareholders. The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that
target company with the Company. The combination will normally take the form of a merger
 stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets
exchange. In most instances
 the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of
a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. The Company is contemplating
a combination with a related entity as discussed in Note 4
 but no agreements are currently in place
 and no assurances can be
given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company has been formed to provide
a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On November 7
 2017
 the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Fah Mai Holdings Limited
and Platinum Cask Limited from Louis Haseman at his cost and they became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. These
companies had no operations and neither assets nor liabilities.


Basis
of Presentation


presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements. Such financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company&rsquo;s management
 who are responsible for their integrity
and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;) in all material respects
 and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements.
 as its fiscal
year end.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
Fah Mai Holdings Limited and Platinum Cask Limited (collectively
 the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;). All intercompany accounts have been
eliminated upon consolidation.




for collection and possible marketing and re-sale. The inventory is recorded at the lower of cost (purchase price including fees)
or market.

NOTE
2 &ndash; GOING CONCERN


since inception to date and has sustained an operating loss of $35
687 for the year ended December 31
 2017 compared
to an operating loss of $7
562 for the year ended December 31
 2016. The Company had a working capital surplus of $79
295
and an accumulated deficit of $43
249 as of December 31
 2017 compared to a working capital deficit of $5
250 and an
accumulated deficit of $7
562 as of December 31
 2016. The Company&rsquo;s continuation as a going concern is dependent on
its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and from stockholders to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional
financing from its members or other sources
 as may be required.

The
Company&rsquo;s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue
as a going concern. At present
 the Company has no operations and the continuation of Fah Mai Holdings Inc. as a going concern
is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders and its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations.

NOTE
3 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Consolidated Financial Statements

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
There were no cash equivalents as of December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 respectively.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.




the United States dollar and British Pounds Sterling and its reporting currency is the United States dollar. Management has adopted
ASC 830-20
 All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. For revenues and expenses
 the weighted
average exchange rate for the period is used. Gains and losses arising on translation of foreign currency denominated transactions
are included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).





Loss

consolidated financial statements. At December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
 the Company had $780 and $0 of accumulated
other comprehensive loss
 relating to foreign currency translation.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

In
accordance with ASC 820
 the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair
value
 and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level
1- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.

Level
2- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar
assets and liabilities in markets that are not active
 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
 and inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data.

Level
3- Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity&rsquo;s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair market
value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Income
Taxes

Under
ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes
&rdquo; deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation
allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts &amp;
Jobs Act
 and have presented the Federal tax provision
 deferred tax asset
 and valuation allowance using the new rates
adjusted in the period of enactment. At December 31
 2017 and 2016 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards (NOL's)
of approximately $35
687 and $7
562 respectively
 which may be applied against future taxable income and which expire
beginning in 2036. However
 if certain substantial changes in the Company's ownership should occur
 there could be an annual
limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized. The amount of and ultimate realization of
the benefits from the operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent
 in part
 upon the tax laws in
effect
 the future earnings of the Company
 and other future events
 the effects of which cannot be determined. Because of
the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carryforwards
 the Company has established a valuation allowance
equal to the tax effect (2017: 26% - 21% federal and 5% state; 2016: 35% - 30% federal and 5% state) of the loss
carryforwards of approximately $9
300 and $2
700 at December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
 and therefore
 no deferred tax
asset has been recognized for the loss carryforwards. The change in valuation allowance is approximately $6
600 and $2
700
for the periods ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The tax effect of remaining NOL's and resulting deferred tax
assets remain fully reserved by valuation allowance
 due to continued uncertainty as to their utilization. As of December 31
2017 and December 31
 2016
 there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss
or carry forward prior to expiration.





of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the consolidated financial
statements. The net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
shares of common outstanding. As of December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 there are no potentially dilutive common stock
equivalents.

687 for the year ended December 31
 2017 compared to an operating&#13;loss of $7

 2016. The Company had a working capital surplus of $79
295 and an accumulated deficit&#13;of $43
249 as of December 31
 2017 compared to a working capital deficit of $5
250 and an accumulated deficit of $7
562 as of December&#13;31
 2016. The Company&amp;#8217;s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from&#13;operations and from stockholders to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources

 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes
&amp;#8221;&#13;deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between&#13;the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets&#13;and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary&#13;differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that&#13;some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding&#13;the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts &amp;#38; Jobs Act
 and have presented the Federal tax provision
 deferred tax&#13;asset
 and valuation allowance using the new rates adjusted in the period of enactment. At December 31
 2017 and 2016 the Company&#13;had net operating loss carryforwards (NOL's) of approximately $35
687 and $7
562 respectively
 which may be applied against future&#13;taxable income and which expire beginning in 2036. However
 if certain substantial changes in the Company's ownership should occur
&#13;there could be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized. The amount of and ultimate&#13;realization of the benefits from the operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent
 in part
 upon the tax laws&#13;in effect
 the future earnings of the Company
 and other future events
 the effects of which cannot be determined. Because of the&#13;uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carryforwards
 the Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the&#13;tax effect (2017: 26% - 21% federal and 5% state; 2016: 35% - 30% federal and 5% state) of the loss carryforwards of approximately&#13;$9
300 and $2
700 at December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
 and therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the&#13;loss carryforwards. The change in valuation allowance is approximately $6
600 and $2
700 for the periods ended December 31
 2017&#13;and 2016
 respectively. The tax effect of remaining NOL's and resulting deferred tax assets remain fully reserved by valuation&#13;allowance
 due to continued uncertainty as to their utilization. As of December 31

 Inc. (formerly Finch Street&#13;Acquisition Corporation) (&amp;#8220;Fah Mai&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;) was incorporated on July 22
 2016 under the laws&#13;of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking
 including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and acquisitions.&#13;The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares&#13;to its original shareholders. The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that&#13;target company with the Company. The combination will normally take the form of a merger
 stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets&#13;exchange. In most instances
 the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of&#13;a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. The Company is contemplating&#13;a combination with a related entity as discussed in Note 4
 but no agreements are currently in place
 and no assurances can be&#13;given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company has been formed to provide&#13;a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the&#13;Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 2016 under the laws
of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking
 including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and acquisitions.
The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares

 the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of
a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. The Company is contemplating
a combination with a related entity as discussed in Note 4

given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company has been formed to provide
a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On November 7
 2017
 the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Fah Mai Holdings Limited and
Platinum Cask Limited from Louis Haseman at his cost and they became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. These companies

 &#8220;Income Taxes
&#8221;
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding
the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts &#38; Jobs Act
 and have presented the Federal tax provision
 deferred tax
asset
 and valuation allowance using the new rates adjusted in the period of enactment. At December 31
 2017 and 2016 the Company
had net operating loss carryforwards (NOL's) of approximately $35
687 and $7
562 respectively
 which may be applied against future
taxable income and which expire beginning in 2036. However
 if certain substantial changes in the Company's ownership should occur
there could be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized. The amount of and ultimate
realization of the benefits from the operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent
 in part
 upon the tax laws
in effect
 the future earnings of the Company
 and other future events
 the effects of which cannot be determined. Because of the
uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carryforwards
 the Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the
tax effect (2017: 26% - 21% federal and 5% state; 2016: 35% - 30% federal and 5% state) of the loss carryforwards of approximately
$9
300 and $2
700 at December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
 and therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the
loss carryforwards. The change in valuation allowance is approximately $6
600 and $2
700 for the periods ended December 31
 2017
and 2016
 respectively. The tax effect of remaining NOL's and resulting deferred tax assets remain fully reserved by valuation
allowance
 due to continued uncertainty as to their utilization. As of December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 there were no deferred
taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.
