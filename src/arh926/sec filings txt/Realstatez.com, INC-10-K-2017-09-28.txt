PART
I
Item


The
Company develops
 designs and distributes its touchscreen-technology to a blue-chip client base. On July 18
 2014
 the Company
completed a reverse merger with the Predecessor
 in which the Company became the surviving entity. On December 15
 2016
 the Company
sold
 assigned
 transferred conveyed and delivered the Predecessor to the Founder. The Founder agreed to forgive all debt owed
to her by the Company in consideration for the Predecessor.
Historically
the Company marketed its touchscreen products primarily through a broad distribution network of distributors exclusive to the
Company&rsquo;s senior management team. Our plan for the next twelve months calls for the further development of the Company&rsquo;s
touchscreen business and customer network. We anticipate that the cost for the further development
 expansion and launch of our
new strategic plan for the touchscreen business will be approximately $1
000
000.
Our
Product

We
design capacitive touchscreen based on our customer&rsquo;s requirements for rear view mirrors
 watches
 printers
 coffee machines
GPS and other electronic products. A quality assured manufacturer with the technical know-how is then engaged for the production
of these newly designed products for our customers.

The
Company has yet to establish &ldquo;Atlas&rdquo; as a renowned brand but intends to develop it so that it too will stand for quality
innovation and service. The Company&rsquo;s services surround the design and selling of customized touchscreens. We operate in
a competitive market but we believe that our designs to customer requirements give us a competitive advantage over some of our
competitors. 
Marketing


Our
marketing efforts are comprised primarily of online social media and word of mouth advertising geared toward building brand recognition
and brand differentiation. We aim to build ourselves to be a leader in the touchscreen market
 and attempt to reinforce on a consistent
basis that it should be a destination of choice for especially premium-quality touchscreens.

The
business is intensely competitive.
We expect to compete with well-established national
 regional and locally- owned traditional touchscreen companies providing designs

 quality
price of products offered
 customer service
 convenience and overall customer experience. Many competitors or potential competitors
have substantially greater financial and other resources
 which may allow them to react more quickly to changes in pricing
 marketing
and other changing tastes of consumers. Because of relative low barriers of entry of the industry
 we will continue to encounter
additional competitors.

We
presently have five employees apart from our officers.

We
do not have a seasonal business cycle.
Environmental
Matters
Our
does
any

Intellectual

The
company has applied two patents
 of which are about to complete the registration process and one is expected to be finished deploying
soon. We may apply for more patents
 trademarks or other registered intellectual property essential to the protection of our brand
and success of our business.

We
assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in the factors or assumptions

share of the global touchscreen technology industry

On
March 23
 2017
 Atlas Technology Shenzhen Trading Co.

 a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atlas
Trading
 was incorporated under the laws of China in order to expand direct sales to more clients throughout China
 lowering dependency
on existing exporters/distributors
 improving margins and exploiting the increasing demand for touchscreens in China.
On
June 30
 2017
 the company&rsquo;s Board of Directors approved the incorporation of Atlas Tech Limited
 a wholly-own subsidiary
of Atlas Technology International
 Inc. Atlas Tech Limited will be registered in Cayman Island and is expected to start operating
in August
 2017.
Plan


Our
goal is to further enhance our proprietary touchscreen technology to a level where we believe
 due primarily to its technological
advantages
 it will be able to rapidly capture and expand its market share of the global touchscreen industry following its official
global launch. Following its global launch
 the Company will seek to build a global reputation for its touchscreen products while
developing a blue-chip
 global client base. We anticipate the cost for developing our touchscreen business will be approximately
$1
000
000 within the next 12 months. We have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize
this goal.
We
are dependent on the timely receipt of our accounts receivables to fund our ongoing operations and execute our business plan.
If we are unable to timely receive our accounts receivable
 we will require capital investment or other financing to fund our
ongoing operations and to execute our business plan. If we are unable to raise additional cash
 we will either have to suspend
or cease our expansion plans entirely. If we are not successful in generating sufficient revenue and cannot raise sufficient funds
we may be forced to cease operations. If that is the case
 we will look for possible merger candidate or another suitable company
to possibly acquire us.
Results


The
Year Ended June 30
 2017 Compared to Eleven Months Ended June 30
 2016
We
generated revenue of $4
242
302 and $0 in the year and eleven months ended June 30
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The increase
in revenue is mainly attributed to the Company&rsquo;s entry into the touchscreen industry business in the year ended June 30
2017. The Company has received orders from four (4) customers for the production of touchscreens per their requirements. The Company
designs the touchscreens
 source manufacturers for the production of the designed touchscreens
 inspects the quality of the products
made by the manufacturers
 purchases the qualified finished-goods and then sells and delivers the touchscreens to their corporate
clients. 

We
incurred cost of goods sold as $2
851
339 and $0 for the year and eleven months ended June 30
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. Cost
of goods sold were related mainly to the touchscreen products purchased from sourced manufacturers for sale.&nbsp;
We
incurred gross margin as 33% and 0% for the year and eleven months ended June 30
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. Gross margin was
higher than the industry average due to company&rsquo;s premium products based on design and the flexibly as a startup.

We
incurred operating expenses of $968
996 and $26
404 for the year and eleven months ended June 30
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.
The increase is mainly due to the cost of research and development
 consultants
 additional employees
 and professional services
related to being a publicly-traded company.&nbsp;
We
incurred Gain on disposal of subsidiary of $12
315 and $0 for the year and eleven months ended June 30
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.
This increase is the result of our disposal of the Predecessor. Such disposal does not constitute a discontinued operation as
it does not represent a strategic shift of the Company&rsquo;s business.

We
incurred interest expense of $45
877 and $0
 for the year and eleven months ended June 30
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The increase
is due to the assignment of non-interest bearing debt from a related party pursuant to which the Company entered into a convertible
promissory note bearing an interest rate of 8% per year with the new debt holder which has beneficial conversion feature
 as well
as a number of non-convertible debt with third parties the Company had entered into and were outstanding as of June 30
 2017 of
$135
078 and bear an interest rate of 6% APR compounded monthly that are due between the dates of November 2017 and June 2018.

We
are dependent on the timely receipt of our accounts receivables to fund our ongoing operations and execute our business plan.
If we are unable to timely receive our accounts receivable
 we will require capital investment or other financing to fund our
ongoing operations and to execute our business plan. If we are unable to raise additional cash
 we will either have to suspend
or cease our expansion plans entirely. If we are not successful in generating sufficient revenue and cannot raise sufficient funds
we may be forced to cease operations. If that is the case
 we will look for possible merger candidate or another suitable company
to possibly acquire us.
Going

The
Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern
 which
contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.

The
company first generated revenues in the year ended June 30
 2017
 and as reflected in the financial statements
 our operating
activities have resulted a net cash outflow of $191
217 for the year ended June 30
 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt
from our auditor about our ability to continue as a going concern.

The
Company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however
 its cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.
While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional
funds
 there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
the Company&rsquo;s ability to further implement its business plan
 generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds.

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

on our audits.


of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required
to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances

Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining

statements
 the Company first generated revenues in the year ended June 30

activities that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these
matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

that disposal of the Predecessor did not constitute a discontinued operation as it did not represent a strategic shift of the
Company&rsquo;s business.
Note
2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices
The
Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness
of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important
to the portrayal of the Company&rsquo;s financial condition and results and require management&rsquo;s most difficult
 subjective
or complex judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company&rsquo;s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States for interim financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company&rsquo;s
management
 which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (&quot;US GAAP&quot;) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements.
Use
of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company believes
the estimates and assumptions utilized are reasonable; however actual results could differ from those estimates.
Stock-based
Compensation
We
account for the grant of stock options
 warrants and restricted stock awards in accordance with ASC 718
 &quot;Compensation-Stock
Compensation&quot;. ASC 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock
options and other equity based compensation. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50
 for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties
compensation expense is determined at the &quot;measurement date&quot;. The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the
award. Until the measurement date is reached
 the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company records
compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third-parties
are then revalued
 or the total compensation is recalculated
 based on the then current fair value
 at each subsequent reporting
date.
Research
and development 
Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs for the year ended June 30
 2017 and
the eleven months ended June 30
 2016 were $473
931 and $0
 respectively.
Accounts
Receivable 
Accounts
receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. In the ordinary course of business
 the Company extends unsecured
credit to its customers based on their credit-worthiness and history with the Company. The Company performs continuing credit
evaluations of its customers&rsquo; financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
The
Company carries its accounts receivable at cost and uses the allowance method to estimate uncollectible accounts receivable when
necessary. Management reviews accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if any receivables will be uncollectible.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
Company applies the guidance of Topic 810 &ldquo;Consolidation&rdquo; of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&quot;ASC&quot;)
to determine whether and how to consolidate another entity. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned subsidiaries&mdash;all
entities in which a parent has a controlling financial interest&mdash;shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest
with the parent
 the majority owner; (2) if the parent is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely
to be temporary; (3) consolidation by an investment company within the scope of Topic 946 of a non-investment-company investee.
Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8 the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting
interest
 and
 therefore
 as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent
of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also
exist with a lesser percentage of ownership
 for example
 by contract
 lease
 agreement with other stockholders
 or by court decree.
The Company consolidates all less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries
 if any
 in which the parent&rsquo;s power to control exists.
The
Company consolidates the following subsidiaries as of June 30
 2017:


Name

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&rdquo;) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described
below:
Level
1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level
2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable
as of the reporting date.
Level
3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.
The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.
The
carrying amounts of our financial assets and liabilities
 such as cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 prepaid
expenses and other current assets
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses and other payables
 income tax payable
  short term
loans
 and convertible debt
 approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of
these instruments.
Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis
 as the requisite conditions of competitive
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties
 if made
 shall not imply that the
related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash in time deposits
 and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities
of three months or less.
Concentration
of Credit Risk 
Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash
 cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. The Company places all cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions.
The
Company performs ongoing credit valuations of its customers&rsquo; financial condition whenever deemed necessary and generally
does not require deposits or collateral to support customer receivables. The company have not recognized any issues on uncollectible
accounts and generated much of its revenue from a limited number of customers.
Lease
Commitments
The
Company has adopted FASB ASC 840. If the lease terms meet one or all of the following four criteria
 it will be classified as
a capital lease
 otherwise
 it is an operating lease: (1) The lease transfers the title to the lessee at the end of the term;
(2) the lease contains a bargain purchase option; (3) the lease term is equal to 75% of the estimated economic life of the leased
property or more; (4) the present value of the minimum lease payment in the term equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the
leased property.
Payments
made under operating leases are charged to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) on a straight-line
basis over the lease period.
Related
Parties

any person that holds 10% or more of the Company&rsquo;s securities and their immediate families
 (ii) the Company&rsquo;s
management
 (iii) someone that directly indirectly controls
 is controlled by or is under common control with the Company
 or
(iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decision of the Company. A transaction is
considered to be a related party transaction where there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties.

    
    


Revenue
Recognition
The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes
revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all
of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer
 (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable
 and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company&rsquo;s business is mainly operated through Atlas Trading
 and operates on a FOB destination model
 where
sale is recognized once the products have been delivered to the customer.
The
Company also follows Section 606-10-55 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification relating to revenue from contracts with customers
for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes gross revenue when the Company: (i) is the primary obligor
 (ii) have general
inventory risk
 (iii) has discretion in establishing the price for the specified products
 (iv) changes the product or performs
part of the service
 (iv) has discretion in supplier selection
 (v) is involved in the determination of product specifications
(vi) bears physical loss inventory risk
 and (vii) has credit risk. The number of the above criteria met and to which extent shall
determine whether the Company considers the revenue to be reported as gross or net.
Foreign
Currency and Other Comprehensive Loss


The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars (&ldquo;US$&rdquo;)
 which is the reporting
currency of the Company. The functional currency of the Company and Atlas Trading are United States dollars. Foreign currency
transactions are those that required settlement in a currency other than United States dollars. Gain or loss from foreign currency
transactions
 are recognized in income in the period they occur. For the year ended June 30
 2017
 the Company had gain of $4
828
resulted from foreign currency transactions
 which was included in other income.

The
functional currency of Atlas China is Renminbi (&ldquo;RMB&rdquo;). The financial statements of Atlas China are translated to
United States dollars in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 830
 &ldquo;Foreign Currency Matters&rdquo;
using year-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities
 and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues
 costs
and expenses and historical rates for equity. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency
financial statements into United States dollars are included in determining other comprehensive loss.

Translation

Income
taxes
Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;). Under
this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized
in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not
to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
Earnings
per Share
Earnings
per share (&quot;EPS&quot;) is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience
 the term is
used to refer to either earnings or loss per share.

    
    


Under
the provisions of ASC 260
 &ldquo;Earnings Per Share
&rdquo; basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.
Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred
stock and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock from income from continuing operations.
Diluted
earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock
were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the income
of the company
 subject to anti-dilution limitations.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
In
August 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&quot;ASU&quot;)
No. 2016-15
 &ldquo;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)
 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments&rdquo;. The
main objective of this update is to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented
and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230
 Statement of Cash Flows
 and other Topics. This update addresses
eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The eight cash flow updates
relate to the following issues: 1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; 2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments
or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the
borrowing; 3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; 4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance
claims; 5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies
 including bank-owned life insurance policies;
6) distributions received from equity method investees; 7) beneficial interest in securitization transactions; and 8) separately
identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The amendments in this update are effective for public
business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption
of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.
In
November
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-18
 &ldquo;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash&rdquo;. It is intended to reduce
diversity in the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement. The statement requires that
restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included as components of total cash and cash equivalents as presented on the
statement of cash flows. This pronouncement goes into effect for periods beginning after December 15
 2017. The adoption of ASU
2016-18 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.
In
December
 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-20
 &ldquo;Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers&rdquo;. The amendments in ASU 2016-20 affect narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09 including Loan
Guarantee Fees
 Contract Costs
 Provisions for Losses on Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts
 Disclosure of Remaining
Performance Obligations
 Disclosure of Prior Period Performance Obligations
 Contract Modifications
 Contract Asset vs. Receivable
Refund Liability
 Advertising Costs
 Fixed Odds Wagering Contracts in the Casino Industry
 and Costs Capitalized for Advisors
to Private Funds and Public Funds. The effective date of these amendments is at the same date that Topic 606 is effective. Topic
606 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting
periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial
statements.
In
January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-03
 &ldquo;Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (Topic 250) and Investments - Equity
Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323)&rdquo;. This pronouncement amends the SEC&rsquo;s reporting requirements for public filers
in regard to new accounting pronouncements or existing pronouncements that have not yet been adopted. Companies are to provide
qualitative disclosures if they have not yet implemented an accounting standards update. Companies should disclose if they are
unable to estimate the impact of a specific pronouncement
 and provide disclosures including a description of the effect on accounting
policies that the registrant expects to apply. These provisions apply to all pronouncements that have not yet been implemented
by registrants. There are additional provisions that relate to corrections to several other prior FASB pronouncements. The Company
has incorporated language into other recently issued accounting pronouncement notes
 where relevant for the corrections in FASB
ASU 2017-03. The Company is implementing the updated SEC requirements on not yet adopted accounting pronouncements with these
consolidated financial statements.
Note
3 &ndash; Going Concern

The
Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern
 which
contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.

We
first generated revenues in the year ended June 30
 2017
 and as reflected in the consolidated financial statements
 our operating
activities have resulted a net cash outflow of $191
217 for the year ended June 30
 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt
from our auditor about our ability to continue as a going concern.

The
Company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however
 its cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.
While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional
funds
 there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
the Company&rsquo;s ability to further implement its business plan
 generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds.

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

Note 2 - Significant
and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices
The
Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of
accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to
the portrayal of the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results and require management&#8217;s most difficult
 subjective
or complex judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company&#8217;s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.


financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim
financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company&#8217;s management
 which is responsible
for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States (&#34;US GAAP&#34;) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates
and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions utilized are reasonable; however actual results could
differ from those estimates.


of stock options
 warrants and restricted stock awards in accordance with ASC 718
 &#34;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#34;. ASC
718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity
based compensation. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50
 for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties
 compensation
expense is determined at the &#34;measurement date&#34;. The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until
the measurement date is reached
 the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company records compensation expense
based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third-parties are then revalued
or the total compensation is recalculated
 based on the then current fair value
 at each subsequent reporting date.
Research and development


costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs for the year ended June 30
 2017 and the eleven months
ended June 30
 2016 were $473
931 and $0
 respectively.
Accounts Receivable


customer obligations due under normal trade terms. In the ordinary course of business
 the Company extends unsecured credit to
its customers based on their credit-worthiness and history with the Company. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations
of its customers&#8217; financial condition and generally does not require collateral.

accounts receivable at cost and uses the allowance method to estimate uncollectible accounts receivable when necessary. Management
reviews accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if any receivables will be uncollectible.


guidance of Topic 810 &#8220;Consolidation&#8221; of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;ASC&#34;) to determine whether
and how to consolidate another entity. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned subsidiaries&#8212;all entities
in which a parent has a controlling financial interest&#8212;shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest with the
parent
 the majority owner; (2) if the parent is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely to be temporary;
(3) consolidation by an investment company within the scope of Topic 946 of a non-investment-company investee. Pursuant to ASC
Paragraph 810-10-15-8 the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest
 and
therefore
 as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent of the outstanding
voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also exist with a lesser
percentage of ownership
 for example
 by contract
 lease
 agreement with other stockholders
 or by court decree. The Company consolidates
all less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries
 if any
 in which the parent&#8217;s power to control exists.

820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#8221;) to measure the fair value of
its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting
date.

that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.

considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques
and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one
level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
of the instrument.

interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; 3) contingent consideration
payments made after a business combination; 4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; 5) proceeds from the settlement
of corporate-owned life insurance policies
 including bank-owned life insurance policies; 6) distributions received from equity
method investees; 7) beneficial interest in securitization transactions; and 8) separately identifiable cash flows and application
of the predominance principle. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

restricted cash equivalents be included as components of total cash and cash equivalents as presented on the statement of cash
flows. This pronouncement goes into effect for periods beginning after December 15
 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-18 is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim
financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company&#8217;s management
 which is responsible
for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States (&#34;US GAAP&#34;) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.






Use of Estimates
and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions utilized are reasonable; however actual results could
differ from those estimates.








of stock options
 warrants and restricted stock awards in accordance with ASC 718
 &#34;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#34;. ASC
718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity
based compensation. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50
 for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties
 compensation
expense is determined at the &#34;measurement date&#34;. The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until
the measurement date is reached
 the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company records compensation expense
based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third-parties are then revalued
or the total compensation is recalculated
 based on the then current fair value
 at each subsequent reporting date.





Research and development


costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs for the year ended June 30

guidance of Topic 810 &#8220;Consolidation&#8221; of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;ASC&#34;) to determine whether
and how to consolidate another entity. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned subsidiaries&#8212;all entities
in which a parent has a controlling financial interest&#8212;shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest with the
parent
 the majority owner; (2) if the parent is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely to be temporary;
(3) consolidation by an investment company within the scope of Topic 946 of a non-investment-company investee. Pursuant to ASC
Paragraph 810-10-15-8 the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest
 and
therefore
 as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent of the outstanding
voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also exist with a lesser
percentage of ownership
 for example
 by contract
 lease
 agreement with other stockholders
 or by court decree. The Company consolidates
all less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries
 if any
 in which the parent&#8217;s power to control exists.

its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting
date.

that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.

 discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques
and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one
level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
of the instrument.

 &#8220;Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230)
 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments&#8221;. The main objective of this update
is to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
of cash flows under Topic 230
 Statement of Cash Flows
 and other Topics. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues
with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The eight cash flow updates relate to the following issues:
1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; 2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon
interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; 3) contingent consideration
payments made after a business combination; 4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; 5) proceeds from the settlement
of corporate-owned life insurance policies
 including bank-owned life insurance policies; 6) distributions received from equity
method investees; 7) beneficial interest in securitization transactions; and 8) separately identifiable cash flows and application
of the predominance principle. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

 the FASB
issued ASU 2016-18
 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash&#8221;. It is intended to reduce diversity in the
presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement. The statement requires that restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents be included as components of total cash and cash equivalents as presented on the statement of cash
flows. This pronouncement goes into effect for periods beginning after December 15
 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-18 is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.
