Oranco
&#160;&#160;Inc.
 (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada
 on June 10
 1977. The purposes for which the corporation was organized were: (1) to engage in any lawful business from time to time authorized by the board of directors
 (2) to act as principal
 agent
 partner or joint venturer or in any other capacity in any transaction
 (3) to do business anywhere in the world
 and (4) to have and exercise all rights and powers from time to time granted to the corporation by law. From 1977 until 1981 the Company was dormant and undertook no activities. Beginning in 1982 the Company explored the option of entering into a joint venture to develop a mercury mining property at Mercury Mountain
 Nevada. As a part of these activities the Company
 through the sale of its common stock
 raised funds to engage the services of an independent mining engineer to prepare a report on the feasibility of the project. By late 1983 it had been determined that the project did not warrant any further investment. From that time until 1997 the Company&#8217;s activities concentrated on maintaining its corporate existence and looking for other opportunities for the Company. In May of 1997 new management was appointed
 a shareholders&#8217; meeting was held
 amendments to the Company&#8217;s articles of incorporation were approved
 and additional effort was made by new management to make the Company a viable merger candidate. These efforts included engaging the services of a certified Public Accounting firm to audit the Company&#8217;s financial statements
 obtaining an Opinion of Counsel as to the tradability of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares
 preparation of the information required by Rule 15c2-11
 and applying to the OTC Bulletin Board for trading on the medium.


By September of 1999
 no viable acquisitions or merger candidates had been located for the Company and management became aware that the Company would be required to register its shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in order to maintain its stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. Management determined that the Company needed new management which might be better positioned to find a suitable acquisition or merger candidate and which would be in a position of funding the upcoming expenses of the Company. On September 1
 1999 management of the Company resigned and Claudio Gianascio was appointed as sole director and officer. On November 9
 1999 the Company sold 700
000 of its common stock to Mr. Gianascio for $.05 per share
 netting a total of $35
000. On November 18
 1999 the Company filed a registration statement on Form 10SB which became effective sixty days thereafter.


The Company had an initial authorized&#160;&#160;capital of $25
000&#160;&#160;consisting&#160;&#160;of 100
000 shares of $.25 par value common stock. On June 10
 1997 the shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of The Company changing the authorized capital to 100
000
000 shares at a par value of $.001 and providing for a 10 to 1 share forward split of the outstanding shares. The Articles of Amendment were filed with the State of Nevada on August 6
 1998.


&#160;In the summer of 2000
 the Company completed a private placement of 2
500
000 units for which it received $250
000 Each unit consisted of one share of common stock; one &#8220;a&#8221; warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase
 upon a minimum of 60 days prior notice of exercise
 one share of common stock at $.10 per share within two years of the date of issuance; and one &#8220;b&#8221; warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase
 upon a minimum of 60 days prior notice of exercise
 one share of common stock at $.25 per share within two years of the date of issuance. Both &#8220;a&#8221; &amp; &#8220;b&#8221; warrants expired without exercise.



















Other than the&#160;&#160;above-referenced&#160;&#160;matters&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;seeking&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;investigating potential&#160;&#160;assets
&#160;&#160;properties or businesses to acquire
&#160;&#160;the Company has had no business&#160;&#160;operations&#160;&#160;since&#160;&#160;inception. To provide revenue on an interim basis
 the Company has held its funds in interest bearing bank accounts
 made short term loans to reputable unaffiliated corporations
 and funded the pursuit of one lawsuit.


To the extent that the&#160;&#160;Company&#160;&#160;intends to continue&#160;&#160;to seek the&#160;&#160;acquisition&#160;&#160;of assets
&#160;&#160;property&#160;&#160;or&#160;&#160;business&#160;&#160;that may benefit the Company and its&#160;&#160;stockholders
&#160;&#160;it is&#160;&#160;essentially&#160;&#160;a blank&#160;&#160;check company.&#160;&#160;Because&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Company has&#160;&#160;limited&#160;&#160;assets and&#160;&#160;conducts no&#160;&#160;business
 management&#160;&#160;anticipates&#160;&#160;that any such&#160;&#160;acquisition&#160;&#160;would&#160;&#160;require&#160;&#160;it to issue shares of its common stock as the sole&#160;&#160;consideration for the acquisition.&#160;&#160;This may result in substantial&#160;&#160;dilution of the shares of current&#160;&#160;stockholders.&#160;&#160;The Company's&#160;&#160;Board of&#160;&#160;Directors&#160;&#160;shall&#160;&#160;make the final&#160;&#160;determination&#160;&#160;whether to complete any such&#160;&#160;acquisition;&#160;&#160;the approval of stockholders will not be sought unless&#160;&#160;required by&#160;&#160;applicable&#160;&#160;laws
&#160;&#160;rules and&#160;&#160;regulations
&#160;&#160;its Articles of Incorporation&#160;&#160;or Bylaws
&#160;&#160;or contract.&#160;&#160;The Company makes no assurance that any future enterprise will be profitable or successful.


The Company is not currently engaging in any substantive business activity and has no plans to engage in any such activity in the foreseeable future.&#160;&#160;In its present form
 the Company may be deemed to be a vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company.&#160;&#160;The Company does not intend to restrict its search to any particular business or industry
 and the areas in which it will seek out acquisitions
&#160;&#160;reorganizations&#160;&#160;or mergers may include
&#160;&#160;but will not be limited to
 the fields of high technology
&#160;&#160;manufacturing
&#160;&#160;natural resources
&#160;&#160;service
 research and development
 communications
&#160;&#160;transportation
 insurance
 brokerage
 finance and all medically related fields
&#160;&#160;among others.&#160;&#160;The Company recognizes that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to it may be extremely limited
 and may be restricted to entities who desire to avoid what these entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering (IPO).&#160;&#160;The most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements
 legal and accounting costs
 the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares
 the lack of or the inability to obtain the&#160;&#160;required financial&#160;&#160;statements&#160;&#160;for such an undertaking
&#160;&#160;limitations&#160;&#160;on the&#160;&#160;amount of&#160;&#160;dilution&#160;&#160;to public&#160;&#160;investors&#160;&#160;in comparison to the stockholders of any such entities
 along with other conditions or requirements&#160;&#160;imposed by various federal and state securities laws
 rules and regulations.&#160;&#160;Any of these types of entities
&#160;&#160;regardless of their&#160;&#160;prospects
 would require the Company to issue a substantial&#160;&#160;number of shares of its common stock to&#160;&#160;complete&#160;&#160;any such&#160;&#160;acquisition
&#160;&#160;reorganization&#160;&#160;or&#160;&#160;merger
&#160;&#160;usually amounting to between 80 and 95 percent of the outstanding shares of the Company following the completion of any such transaction;&#160;&#160;accordingly
&#160;&#160;investments in any such private&#160;&#160;entity
&#160;&#160;if available
&#160;&#160;would be much more&#160;&#160;favorable than any investment in the Company.


In the event that the Company engages in any transaction resulting in a change of control of the Company&#160;&#160;and/or the&#160;&#160;acquisition&#160;&#160;of a&#160;&#160;business
&#160;&#160;the Company will be required to file with the Commission&#160;&#160;a Current&#160;&#160;Report on Form 8-K within the time periods provided for.&#160;&#160;A filing on Form 8-K also requires the filing of audited financial statements of the business acquired
 as well as pro forma financial information&#160;&#160;consisting of a pro forma condensed balance sheet
 pro forma statements of income and accompanying explanatory notes.


Management intends to consider a number of factors&#160;&#160;prior to making any decision as to whether to participate in any specific business endeavor
 none of which may be determinative&#160;&#160;or provide&#160;&#160;any&#160;&#160;assurance&#160;&#160;of&#160;&#160;success.&#160;&#160;These
may include
 but will not be limited to an analysis of the quality of the entity's management&#160;&#160;personnel;&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;anticipated&#160;&#160;acceptability&#160;&#160;of any new&#160;&#160;products or marketing concepts;&#160;&#160;the merit of technological&#160;&#160;changes;&#160;&#160;its present financial condition
&#160;&#160;projected&#160;&#160;growth potential and available&#160;&#160;technical
&#160;&#160;financial and managerial&#160;&#160;resources;&#160;&#160;its working&#160;&#160;capital
&#160;&#160;history of operations&#160;&#160;and future prospects;&#160;&#160;the nature of its present and expected competition;&#160;&#160;the quality and experience&#160;&#160;of its&#160;&#160;management&#160;&#160;services&#160;&#160;and the depth of its&#160;&#160;management;&#160;&#160;its potential&#160;&#160;for&#160;&#160;further&#160;&#160;research
&#160;&#160;development&#160;&#160;or&#160;&#160;exploration;&#160;&#160;risk&#160;&#160;factors specifically&#160;&#160;related to its&#160;&#160;business&#160;&#160;operations;&#160;&#160;its&#160;&#160;potential&#160;&#160;for growth
 expansion and profit;&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;perceived&#160;&#160;public&#160;&#160;recognition&#160;&#160;or acceptance of its products
&#160;&#160;services
&#160;&#160;trademarks&#160;&#160;and name&#160;&#160;identification;&#160;&#160;and numerous&#160;&#160;other factors&#160;&#160;which are&#160;&#160;difficult
&#160;&#160;if not&#160;&#160;impossible
&#160;&#160;to properly&#160;&#160;or&#160;&#160;accurately analyze
 let alone describe or identify
 without referring to specific objective criteria

Regardless
 the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future
 by reason of changing market&#160;&#160;strategies
&#160;&#160;plant or product&#160;&#160;expansion
&#160;&#160;changes in product&#160;&#160;emphasis
 future management&#160;&#160;personnel and changes in innumerable other factors.&#160;&#160;Further
 in the case of a new&#160;&#160;business&#160;&#160;venture&#160;&#160;or one&#160;&#160;that&#160;&#160;is in a&#160;&#160;research&#160;&#160;and development mode
 the risks will be substantial
&#160;&#160;and there will be no objective criteria to examine the&#160;&#160;effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business&#160;&#160;objectives.&#160;&#160;Also
 a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established
 and with no past track record
 the profitability of any such entity will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty.


&#160;Management&#160;&#160;will&#160;&#160;attempt&#160;&#160;to&#160;&#160;meet&#160;&#160;personally&#160;&#160;with&#160;&#160;management&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;key personnel&#160;&#160;of the entity&#160;&#160;sponsoring&#160;&#160;any business&#160;&#160;opportunity&#160;&#160;afforded to the Company
&#160;&#160;visit and inspect material facilities
&#160;&#160;obtain independent analysis or verification&#160;&#160;of&#160;&#160;information&#160;&#160;&#160;provided&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;gathered
&#160;&#160;&#160;check&#160;&#160;references&#160;&#160;of management&#160;&#160;and key&#160;&#160;personnel&#160;&#160;and conduct other&#160;&#160;reasonably&#160;&#160;prudent&#160;&#160;measures calculated to ensure a reasonably&#160;&#160;thorough&#160;&#160;review of any&#160;&#160;particular&#160;&#160;business opportunity;&#160;&#160;however
&#160;&#160;due to time constraints of management
&#160;&#160;these activities may be limited.

















The Company is unable to predict the time as to when and if it may actually participate in any specific&#160;&#160;business&#160;&#160;endeavor.&#160;&#160;The Company&#160;&#160;anticipates&#160;&#160;that proposed&#160;&#160;business&#160;&#160;ventures&#160;&#160;will&#160;&#160;be made&#160;&#160;available&#160;&#160;to it&#160;&#160;through&#160;&#160;personal contacts&#160;&#160;of&#160;&#160;directors
&#160;&#160;&#160;executive&#160;&#160;&#160;officers&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;&#160;principal&#160;&#160;&#160;stockholders
 professional advisors
 broker dealers in securities
&#160;&#160;venture capital personnel
 members&#160;&#160;of the&#160;&#160;financial&#160;&#160;community&#160;&#160;and others&#160;&#160;who may&#160;&#160;present&#160;&#160;unsolicited proposals.&#160;&#160;In certain cases
&#160;&#160;the Company may agree to pay a finder's fee or to otherwise&#160;&#160;compensate&#160;&#160;the persons who submit a potential&#160;&#160;business&#160;&#160;endeavor in which&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Company&#160;&#160;eventually&#160;&#160;participates.&#160;&#160;Such persons&#160;&#160;may&#160;&#160;include&#160;&#160;the Company's directors
&#160;&#160;executive officers
 beneficial owners or their affiliates. In this&#160;&#160;event
&#160;&#160;such&#160;&#160;fees may&#160;&#160;become a factor&#160;&#160;in&#160;&#160;negotiations&#160;&#160;regarding&#160;&#160;a potential acquisition and
&#160;&#160;accordingly
&#160;&#160;may present a conflict of interest for such individuals.


Although the Company has not identified any potential&#160;&#160;acquisition&#160;&#160;target
 the possibility&#160;&#160;exists that the Company may acquire or merge with a business or company in which the Company's executive officers
 directors
&#160;&#160;beneficial owners or their affiliates may have an ownership interest.&#160;&#160;Current Company policy does not prohibit such&#160;&#160;transactions.&#160;&#160;Because no such transaction is currently contemplated
 it is impossible to estimate the potential&#160;&#160;pecuniary benefits to these persons.


&#160;Further
 substantial fees are often paid in connection with the completion of these types of acquisitions
 reorganizations or mergers
 ranging from a small amount to as much as $250
000. These fees are usually divided among promoters or founders
&#160;&#160;after deduction of legal
&#160;&#160;accounting and other related expenses
 and it is not&#160;&#160;unusual&#160;&#160;for a&#160;&#160;portion&#160;&#160;of&#160;&#160;these&#160;&#160;fees&#160;&#160;to be paid&#160;&#160;to&#160;&#160;members&#160;&#160;of management or to principal&#160;&#160;stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of the shares of common stock owned by them.&#160;&#160;In the event that such fees are paid
&#160;&#160;they may&#160;&#160;become a factor in&#160;&#160;negotiations&#160;&#160;regarding&#160;&#160;any potential acquisition by the Company and
 accordingly
 may present a conflict of interest for such individuals.




The limited&#160;&#160;business&#160;&#160;operations&#160;&#160;of the&#160;&#160;Company
&#160;&#160;as now&#160;&#160;contemplated
 involve those of a blank check company. The only activities to be conducted by the&#160;&#160;Company&#160;&#160;are to&#160;&#160;manage&#160;&#160;its&#160;&#160;current&#160;&#160;limited&#160;&#160;assets&#160;&#160;and to seek out and investigate the&#160;&#160;acquisition of any viable business&#160;&#160;opportunity by purchase and exchange for securities of the Company or pursuant to a reorganization or merger through which securities of the Company will be issued or exchanged.





&#160;Management will seek out and&#160;&#160;investigate&#160;&#160;business&#160;&#160;opportunities&#160;&#160;through every reasonably available fashion
 including personal contacts
&#160;&#160;professionals
 securities broker dealers
&#160;&#160;venture capital personnel
&#160;&#160;members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals; the Company may also advertise its&#160;&#160;availability as a vehicle to bring a company to the public market through a reverse reorganization or merger.











Management&#160;&#160;believes&#160;&#160;that there are&#160;&#160;literally&#160;&#160;thousands of blank check companies engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by the Company;&#160;&#160;many of&#160;&#160;these&#160;&#160;companies&#160;&#160;have&#160;&#160;&#160;substantial current&#160;&#160;assets&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;cash&#160;&#160;reserves. Competitors&#160;&#160;also&#160;&#160;include&#160;&#160;thousands&#160;&#160;of other&#160;&#160;publicly-held&#160;&#160;companies&#160;&#160;whose business&#160;&#160;operations&#160;&#160;have proven&#160;&#160;unsuccessful
&#160;&#160;and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets. There is no reasonable way to predict the&#160;&#160;competitive&#160;&#160;position of the Company or any other&#160;&#160;entity in the strata of these endeavors;&#160;&#160;however
 the Company
 having limited assets and cash reserves
&#160;&#160;will no doubt be at a&#160;&#160;competitive&#160;&#160;disadvantage&#160;&#160;in&#160;&#160;competing&#160;&#160;with entities which have recently&#160;&#160;completed&#160;&#160;IPO's
&#160;&#160;have significant cash resources and have recent operating&#160;&#160;histories when compared with the complete lack of any substantive operations by the Company for the past several years.

&#160;&#160;it&#160;&#160;will&#160;&#160;become&#160;&#160;subject&#160;&#160;to&#160;&#160;all governmental&#160;&#160;approval&#160;&#160;requirements to











None; not applicable.&#160;&#160;However
&#160;&#160;environmental&#160;&#160;laws
 rules and regulations may have an adverse&#160;&#160;effect on any business&#160;&#160;venture viewed by the Company as an attractive&#160;&#160;acquisition
&#160;&#160;reorganization or merger candidate
&#160;&#160;and these factors may further&#160;&#160;limit the number of potential&#160;&#160;candidates&#160;&#160;available to the Company for acquisition
 reorganization or merger.










The Company&#8217;s business is subject to numerous risk factors
 including the following.


 The Company has no significant assets or financial resources. The Company will
 in all likelihood
 sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues
 at least until the consummation of a business combination. This may result in the Company incurring a net operating loss which will increase continuously until the Company can consummate a business combination with a target company. There is no assurance that the Company can identify such a target company and consummate such a business combination.


&#160;&#160;The success of the Company&#8217;s proposed plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations
 financial condition and management of the identified target company. While management will prefer business combinations with entities having established operating histories
 there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in locating candidates meeting such criteria. In the event the Company completes a business combination
 of which there can be no assurance
 the success of the Company&#8217;s operations will be dependent upon management of the target company and numerous other factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control.

















 A large number of established and well-financed entities
 including venture capital firms
 are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies which may be merger or acquisition target candidates for the Company. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources
 technical expertise and managerial capabilities than the Company and
 consequently
 the Company will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover
 the Company will also compete with numerous other small public companies in seeking merger or acquisition candidates.


The Company has no current arrangement
no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate a business combination on terms favorable to the Company. The Company has not established a specific length of operating history or a specified level of earnings
 assets
worth or other criteria which it will require a target company to have achieved
 or without which the Company would not consider a business combination with such business entity. Accordingly
 the Company may enter into a business combination with a business entity having no significant operating history
 losses
 limited or no potential for immediate earnings
 limited assets
 negative net worth or other negative characteristics.


&#160;&#160;While seeking a business combination
anticipates devoting only a limited amount of time per month to the business of the Company. The Company&#8217;s sole officer has not entered into a written employment agreement with the Company and he is not expected to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company has not obtained key man life insurance on its officer and director. Notwithstanding the combined limited experience and time commitment of management
 loss of the services of this individual would adversely affect development of the Company&#8217;s business and its likelihood of continuing operations.


 Additional conflicts of interest and non-arms length transactions may also arise in the future.&#160;&#160;Management has adopted a policy that the Company will not seek a merger with
 or acquisition of
 any entity in which any member of management serves as an officer
 director or partner
 or in which they or their family members own or hold any ownership interest.


&#160;&#160;Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) requires companies subject thereto to provide certain information about significant acquisitions including certified financial statements for the company acquired covering one or two years
 depending on the relative size of the acquisition. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target companies to prepare such financial statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by the Company. Acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable.


The Company has neither conducted
 nor have others made available to it

 there is no assurance the Company will be successful in completing any such business combination.


The Company&#8217;s proposed operations
 even if successful

 the Company&#8217;s activities will be limited to those engaged in by the business entity which the Company merges with or acquires. The Company&#8217;s inability to diversify its activities into a number of areas may subject the Company to economic fluctuations within a particular business or industry and therefore increase the risks associated with the Company&#8217;s operations.


&#160;&#160;Although the Company will be subject to regulation under the Exchange Act
 management believes the Company will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940
 insofar as the Company will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event the Company engages in business combinations which result in the Company holding passive investment interests in a number of entities
 the Company could be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In such event
 the Company would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs. The Company has obtained no formal determination from the Securities and Exchange Commission as to the status of the Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
 consequently
 any violation of such Act could subject the Company to material adverse consequences.


A business combination involving the issuance of the Company&#8217;s common stock will
 in all likelihood

 there are no pending acquisitions
 business combinations or mergers.

















The Company&#8217;s primary plan of operation is based upon a business combination with a business entity which
 in all likelihood
 will result in the Company issuing securities to shareholders of such business entity.


Federal and state tax consequences will
 in all likelihood

 such transactions may be structured so as to result in tax-free treatment to both companies
 pursuant to various federal and state tax provisions. The Company intends to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to both the Company and the target company; however
 there can be no assurance that such business combination will meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or that the parties will obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal and state taxes which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction.


 One or more attractive business opportunities may choose to forego the possibility of a business combination with the Company rather than incur the expenses associated with preparing audited financial statements. In such case
 the Company may choose to obtain certain assurances as to the target company&#8217;s assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expenses prior to consummating a business combination
 with further assurances that audited financial statements would be provided after closing of such a transaction.&#160;&#160;Closing documents relative thereto may include representations that the audited financial statements will not materially differ from the representations included in such closing documents.


Our stock is subject to the Penny Stock rules
Stock trading rules
 and investors will experience resale restrictions and a lack of liquidity. A penny stock is generally a stock that:












































The penny stock trading rules impose additional duties and responsibilities upon broker-dealers and salespersons effecting purchase and sale transactions in common stock and other equity securities
 including:

















































Due to the Penny Stock rules
 many broker-dealers will not effect transactions in penny stocks except on an unsolicited basis.&#160;&#160;When our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock trading rules












such rules may materially limit or restrict the ability to resell our common stock
 and















&#160;&#160;There is no assurance a market will be made in our stock.&#160;&#160;If no market exists
 you will not be able to sell your shares publicly
 making your investment of little or no value.




The Company has no assets
 property or any physical business office or other facilities. Its principal executive office address is the business office&#160;&#160;address&#160;&#160;of its transfer agent
 Interwest Transfer Co.
 Inc.
 which
 as a courtesy to its clients
 provides mail forwarding services&#160;&#160;Because the Company has had no&#160;&#160;business
&#160;&#160;its&#160;&#160;activities&#160;&#160;will be limited to keeping itself in good standing in the State of Nevada
 seeking out acquisitions
&#160;&#160;&#160;reorganizations&#160;&#160;&#160;or&#160;&#160;mergers&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;&#160;preparing&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;filing&#160;&#160;the appropriate&#160;&#160;reports&#160;&#160;with&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Securities&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;Exchange Commission.&#160;&#160;&#160;These activities have consumed an insubstantial amount of management's time.





To the knowledge&#160;&#160;of&#160;&#160;management
&#160;&#160;no federal
&#160;&#160;state or local&#160;&#160;governmental&#160;&#160;agency is presently&#160;&#160;contemplating&#160;&#160;any&#160;&#160;proceeding&#160;&#160;against&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Company.&#160;&#160;No director
 executive officer or affiliate of the Company or owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of the Company's common stock is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company in any proceeding.








There is no public market for shares of common stock of the Company. Although the Company&#8217;s shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board of the National Association of Securities Dealers
 the Company is aware of only a few transactions that have taken place in the previous ten years. In any event
 no assurance can be given that any market for the&#160;&#160;Company's&#160;&#160;common stock will develop or be maintained.

The ability of an individual shareholder to trade their shares in a particular state may be subject to various rules and regulations of that state.&#160;&#160;A number of states require that an issuer's securities be registered in their state or appropriately exempted from registration before the securities are permitted to trade in that state.&#160;&#160;Presently
 the Company has no plans to register its securities in any particular state.&#160;&#160;Further
 most likely the Company's&#160;&#160;shares will be subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the Exchange Act)
 commonly referred to as the penny stock rule.&#160;&#160;Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stocks and Rule 15g-9(d)(1) incorporates the definition of penny stock as that used in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act.

















The Commission generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share
unless that security is: registered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the Commission; authorized for quotation on The NASDAQ Stock Market; issued by a registered investment company; excluded from the definition on the basis of price (at least $5.00 per share) or the issuer's net tangible assets; or exempted from the definition by the Commission.&#160;&#160;If the Company's shares are deemed to be a penny stock
 trading in the shares will be subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker- dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors
 generally persons with assets in excess of $1
000
000 or annual income exceeding $200
000
 or $300
000 together with their spouse.


For transactions covered by these rules
 broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and must have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 for any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
 the rules require the delivery
 prior to the first transaction
 of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock market.&#160;&#160;A broker- dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative
 and current quotations for the securities.&#160;&#160;Finally
 monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.&#160;&#160;Consequently
 these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade and/or maintain a market in the Company's Common stock and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares.









dividends in the foreseeable future.&#160;&#160;The future dividend policy of the Company cannot be ascertained with any certainty
 and until the Company completes any acquisition
 reorganization or merger
 as to which no assurance may be given
 no such policy will be formulated. There are no material restrictions limiting
 or that are likely to limit
&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Company's ability to pay dividends on its common stock.



















The Company has not engaged in any material operations or had any revenues from operations since inception.&#160;&#160;The Company's plan of operation&#160;&#160;for the next 12&#160;&#160;months is to&#160;&#160;continue&#160;&#160;to seek the&#160;&#160;acquisition of assets
&#160;&#160;properties&#160;&#160;or&#160;&#160;businesses&#160;&#160;that&#160;&#160;may&#160;&#160;benefit&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Company&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;its stockholders. Management intends to focus its efforts outside the United States both because management is located in Europe and because management believes that the Company can locate superior acquisition opportunities outside the United States.&#160;&#160;Management anticipates that to achieve any such acquisition
 the Company will issue shares of its common stock as the sole consideration for such acquisition.
















During the next 12 months
 the Company's only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Company in good&#160;&#160;standing&#160;&#160;or the&#160;&#160;payment of expenses&#160;&#160;associated&#160;&#160;with&#160;&#160;reviewing or&#160;&#160;investigating&#160;&#160;any potential&#160;&#160;business venture
&#160;&#160;which&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Company&#160;&#160;expects&#160;&#160;to pay from its&#160;&#160;cash&#160;&#160;resources. As of December 31
 2013
 it had $86
337 in cash. Management believes that these funds are sufficient to cover its cash needs for the next 12 months. If additional funds are required during this period
 such funds may be advanced&#160;&#160;by&#160;&#160;management&#160;&#160;or stockholders as loans to the Company. Because the Company has not identified any such venture as of the date of this Report
 it is impossible to predict the amount of any such loan.&#160;&#160;However
 any such loan will be on terms no less favorable to the Company than would be available from a commercial lender in an arm's length transaction. As of the date of this Report
 the Company is not engaged in any negotiations with any person&#160;&#160;regarding&#160;&#160;any venture.




Other than restoring and maintaining its good corporate standing in the State of&#160;&#160;Nevada
&#160;&#160;obtaining an audit of the Company&#8217;s financial statements
 submitting the Company&#8217;s common stock for quotation on the NASD OTC Bulleting Board
 the filing of&#160;&#160;a Form 10 Registration
 the completion of a private placement and the seeking of an appropriate acquisition candidate
 merger partner
 or business venture
 the Company has had no material business operations in the two most recent calendar years.


Year ended December 31
 2013 compared to year ended December 31
 2012


Interest
 for the year ended December 31
 2013 were $2
271 compared to $2
547&#160;&#160;for the year ended December 31
 2012
 a 11 % decrease
 which is attributable to decreased interest income. The Company had no other revenue.


Expenses for the year ended December 31
 2013 were $34
434 compared to $56
807 for the year ended December 31
 2012. This represents a decrease of $22
373 or 39.3% and is attributable to a decrease in travel and exploratory costs incurred and decreases in professional fees.

Net loss for the year ended December 31
 2013 was $32
163 compared to a net loss of $66
760&#160;&#160;for the year ended December 31
 2012. This loss represents an decrease of $34
597 or 51.8%. This decrease in loss is attributable to decreased travel and exploratory costs
 decreased costs associated with regulatory reporting
 and decreases in professional fees.





The Company&#8217;s primary need for capital has been to pay the ongoing administrative expenses associated with being a reporting company such as legal
 accounting and EDGAR filing. The Company
 although more aggressively seeking an acquisition or merger partner and incurring travel and other expenses in relation thereto
 does not anticipate this changing in the next 12 months
 unless a suitable acquisition or merger candidate is located. However
 because of the limited amount available no assurance can be given that this will be the case.

During the fiscal years ended December 31
 2012 and 2013 the Company has been able to pay its expenses and costs through its cash on hand. As of December 31
 2013 The Company had $86
337 in cash or notes receivable compared to $131
005 and accounts payable of $2
825 and $10
450 at December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.




Since we have no assets other than cash in banks and notes receivable and do not have any investments in eligible portfolio companies there is no quantitative information
 as of the end of December 31
 2013
 about market risk that has any impact on our present business. Once we begin making investments in eligible portfolio companies there will be market risk sensitive instruments and we will disclose the applicable market risk information at that time
































Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer/principal financial officer
 we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (Exchange Act)
 as of December 31
 2013. Based on this evaluation
 our principal executive officer/principal financial officers has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms and that our disclosure and controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company&#8217;s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with United State&#8217;s generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)
 including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company
 (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company
 and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.&#160;&#160;Based on this evaluation
 Management concluded the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2013.

Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160;&#160;Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.




This annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm
 regarding internal controls over financial reporting.&#160;&#160;Our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to such attestation as we are a smaller reporting company.




There were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter and year ended December 31
 2013 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Oranco
 Inc. as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 and the related statements of operations
 stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31
 2013. Oranco
 Inc.&#8217;s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Oranco
 Inc. as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years in the two-year period ended December 31
 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

ORANCO
 INC.














The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 16
 1977. The Company has been in the business of the development of mineral deposits. During 1983 all activities were abandoned and the Company has remained inactive since that time. The Company has not commenced principal operations and is considered a Development Stage Company as defined by FASB ASC 915 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 7).
























In July 2009
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 105-10
 formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#8220;SFAS&#8221;) No. 168
 The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 which became the single source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB. ASC 105-10 does not change current U.S. GAAP
 but on the effective date
 the FASB ASC superseded all then existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards.





For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents.


































The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly
 actual results could differ from those estimates.










ASC 820-10 (formerly SFAS No. 157
 Fair Value Measurements) requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments
 both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet
 for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. ASC 820-10 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the carrying value of certain financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments.





On July 5
 2012
 the Company advanced $90
000 for an unsecured note receivable due from a non-related party. The note bears interest at 5% and is due June 30
 2013. The note and accrued interest totaling $91
122 was paid on July 2
 2013.




























At December 31
 2013
 and 2012
 the Company had net deferred tax assets of $90
364
 and $79
428
 respectively. Due to uncertainties surrounding the Company&#8217;s ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets
 a full valuation has been established to offset the net deferred tax asset.


The provision for income tax consists of the following components at December 31
 2013 and 2012:



































































































(10
935



(22
698



















&#160;10

&#160;22
698
















The Company has loss carry forwards totaling $265
776 that may be offset against future federal income taxes. If not used
 the carry forwards will expire 20 years after they are incurred.



















As a result of the implementation of certain provisions of ASC 740
 Income Taxes
 (formerly FIN 48
 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#8211; An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)
 the Company performed an analysis of its previous tax filings and determined that there were no positions taken that it considered uncertain. Therefore
 there was no provision for uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012. Future changes in uncertain tax positions are not expected to have an impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance. The Company will continue to classify income tax penalties and interest
 if any
 as part of interest and other expenses in its statements of operations. The Company has incurred no interest or penalties as of December 31
 2013 and 2012.





The Company&#8217;s board of directors approved a $475 per month office rent to a current director of the Company. The office rent expires as of September 30
 2013. The amount expensed for the year-ending December 31
 2013 and 2012 amounted to $5
700 and $10
450
 respectively.





On July 18
 2012
 the Company settled a dispute with an individual for $12
500. The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice.










Management has evaluated subsequent events through March 21
 2014 the date on which the financial statements were available to be issued.

 or is likely to materially affect
 the small business issuer&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting; and


&#160;5. The small business issuer&#8217;s other certifying officers and I have disclosed
 based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting
 to the small business issuer's auditors and the audit committee of small business issuer&#8217;s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):

(a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the small business issuer's ability to record
 process
 summarize and report financial information; and


(b) any fraud
 whether or not material
 that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the small business issuer&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.

 Income Taxes
 (formerly FIN 48
 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &amp;#150; An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)
 the Company performed an analysis of its previous tax filings and determined that there were no positions taken that it considered uncertain. Therefore
 there was no provision for uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012. Future changes in uncertain tax positions are not expected to have an impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance. The Company will continue to classify income tax penalties and interest
 if any
 as part of interest and other expenses in its statements of operations. The Company has incurred no interest or penalties as of December 31


 2013. The amount expensed for the year-ending December 31
 2013 and 2012 amounted to $5
700 and $10

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 16
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In July 2009
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 105-10
 formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No. 168
 The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 which became the single source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB. ASC 105-10 does not change current U.S. GAAP
 but on the effective date
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For purposes of the statement of cash flows
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.&#160; Accordingly
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ASC 820-10 (formerly SFAS No. 157
 Fair Value Measurements) requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments
 both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet
 for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. ASC 820-10 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the carrying value of certain financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments.
