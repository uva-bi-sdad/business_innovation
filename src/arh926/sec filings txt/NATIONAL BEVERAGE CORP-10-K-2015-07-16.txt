 anniversary
 National Beverage Corp. is an acknowledged leader in the development
 manufacturing
 marketing and sale of a diverse portfolio of flavored beverage products. Our primary market focus is the United States
 but our products are also distributed in Canada
 Mexico
 the Caribbean
 Latin America
 the Pacific Rim
 Asia
 and Europe. A holding company for various operating subsidiaries
 National Beverage Corp. was incorporated in Delaware in 1985 and began trading as a public company on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1991. In this report
 the terms &#8220;we
&#8221; &#8220;us
&#8221; &#8220;our
&#8221; &#8220;Company&#8221; and &#8220;National Beverage&#8221; mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise. 

Our brands consist of (i) beverages geared toward the active and health-conscious consumer (&#8220;Power+ Brands&#8221;)
 including sparkling waters
 energy drinks and shots
 juices
 and enhanced beverages
 and (ii) Carbonated Soft Drinks in a variety of flavors including regular
&nbsp;sugar-free and reduced-calorie options. In addition
 we produce soft drinks for certain retailers (&#8220;Allied Brands&#8221;) that endorse the &#8220;Strategic Alliance&#8221; concept of having our brands and Allied Brands marketed to effectuate enhanced growth of both. We employ a philosophy that emphasizes vertical integration; our manufacturing model integrates the procurement of raw materials and production of concentrates with the manufacture of finished products in our twelve manufacturing facilities. To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers as well as thousands of smaller &#8220;up-and-down-the-street&#8221; accounts
 we have developed a hybrid distribution system that promotes and utilizes customer warehouse distribution facilities and our own direct-store delivery fleet plus the direct-store delivery systems of independent distributors and wholesalers. 










We focus on developing healthier and functional beverages in response to a global shift in consumer buying habits. As health and wellness awareness grows
 consumers are turning to drinks with reduced calories
 a growing group who desire a change from Carbonated Soft Drinks and other artificially flavored
 artificially sweetened beverages.

&#8211; Throughout our product lines
 we emphasize distinctly flavored beverages. Although cola drinks account for approximately 49% of the soft drink industry&#8217;s domestic grocery channel volume
 colas account for less than 20% of our total volume. In the higher margin convenience store channel
 flavors represent 55% of soft drink sales and are outpacing colas. Our flavor development spans more than 125 years and originated with our flagship brands
 Shasta
 each of which offers more than 30 flavor varieties. 

 &#8211; This is our term for the philosophy we employ for the development and support of our brands that have significant regional presence. Because we tailor our marketing and promotion programs by locale
 we believe many of our brands enjoy a regional identification that fosters long-term consumer loyalty and make them less vulnerable to competitive substitution. In addition
 &#8220;home-town&#8221; products often generate more aggressive retailer sponsored promotional activities and receive media exposure through community activities rather than costly national advertising. 

We believe that consumers demand value as the purchase default option in volatile economic times
 and we are intent on producing and developing products of the highest quality that appeal to the value expectations of the family consumer. We believe we can leverage our cost-effective manufacturing and distribution systems
 and our efficient regionally focused marketing programs
 to profitably deliver products to the consumer at a lower price-point than our national competitors. 

 &#8211; In a beverage industry that is dominated by the &#8220;cola giants&#8221;
 we pride ourselves on our ability to respond faster and more creatively to consumer trends than many of our competitors who are burdened by distribution complexity and legacy costs. We strive to build long-term brand value by developing creative marketing programs
 propriety flavors and distinctive packaging. In recent years
 we have introduced numerous new flavors or package sizes and have won many package design awards. We continue to develop products and package sizes designed to expand distribution. We believe that the most dynamic validation of our strategy is our competitors&#8217; efforts to replicate our creative business model.



The National Beverage Corp. brand portfolio contains a wide variety of beverages to meet consumer needs in a multitude of market segments. National Beverage employs its flavor expertise with beverage offerings including
 but not limited to
 the following non-alcoholic beverage segments: 















Carbonated Soda: Sugar Free
 Regular
 and Reduced Calorie






 calories
 sodium
 the 

LaCroix&#8217;s dynamic &#8216;theme&#8217; LaCroix C&#250;rate&#8482; (cure yourself) celebrates French sophistication with Spanish zest with three bold flavors: Pi&#241;a Fra&#237;se (pineapple strawberry)
 Cerise Limon (cherry lime) and Pomme Baya (apple berry) naturally refresh in tall 12 oz. consumer-favored cans. Brilliant graphics
 robust aroma
 naturally &#8216;essenced&#8217; and premium-priced
 C&#250;rate is a trendsetting addition to a brand that is the healthy alternative for trend-forward consumers.

NiCola&#8482; by LaCroix
 a new innovative sparkling water with the essence and flavor of cola
 is &#8216;innocent&#8217; of calories
 sodium
 sweetener or any ingredient that the health-conscious consumer avoids. Since its initial Chicago launch in October 2014
 NiCola has received positive response from cola and diet cola drinkers looking to &#8216;crossover&#8217; to a beverage that complements a healthier lifestyle. 








Additional LaCroix themes are in development and feature unique packaging
 ground-breaking flavor concepts
 and a go-to-market strategy designed to provide additional placements within the retail environment outside the traditional grocery shelf.


&#174; energy fuel is the flavor innovator in the growing energy category with 14 unique flavors including six sugar free
 bringing variety and value to the widening consumer base. Rip It &#8220;Tribute&#8221; themed energy is a successful military inspired addition to the lineup with the latest addition Tribute CYP-X Orange Cr&#232;me. Building on the flavor tradition of original Rip It
 a 2 oz. sugar free shot version with seven flavors is marketed through our distribution system in multiple displayable package configurations. 


&#174; 100% juice and juice drinks are available in more than 35 flavors
 from such classics as Orange
 Cranberry and flavored lemonades to exotics that include Premium Papaya and Pineapple Mango. Originating in the Midwest
 the Everfresh signature package is a hot-filled
 16 oz. glass bottle primarily for single-serve consumption. Additional consumer

&#8482;
 a unique theme from Everfresh
 is positioned as a stand-alone brand for display in the produce section of supermarkets. Everfresh Premier Varietals is a premium line of 100% natural apple juice from a variety of apples specific to the taste of the varietal
 such as Granny Smith
 McIntosh
 Honey Crisp
 Golden Delicious
 Fuji and Pink Lady. Premier Varietals are packaged in award-winning 12 oz. glass bottles with decorative tamper-evident neck seals. 





 and distributed nationally
 Shasta&#174; is recognized as a bottling industry pioneer and innovator. As our largest volume brand
 Shasta features multiple flavors
 including products targeted to the growing Hispanic and other ethnic markets
 and continues to earn consumer loyalty by delivering value
 convenience and such unique tastes as California Dreamin&#8217;
 Very Cherry Twist and Fiesta Punch. Honoring its origin as a sparkling water company
 Shasta will soon introduce a new theme featuring Shasta&#8217;s classic flavors in an unsweetened
 zero-calorie
 refreshing sparkling water concept. 








More than 100 years old
 Faygo&#174; products are primarily distributed east of the Mississippi River and include numerous unique flavors including RedPop&#174;
 Moon Mist&#174;
 soft drinks and seltzers
 primarily in the southeastern U.S.
 in New Orleans and surrounding areas
 soft drinks during the holiday season. During recent years
 we reformulated many of our brands to reduce the caloric content while still preserving their time-tested flavor profiles.

Our Brands
 optically and content-wise
 are always a work in process. As often as innovation develops
 we endeavor to significantly improve them
 striving for quality and authenticity over cost.



Our twelve manufacturing facilities are strategically located near major metropolitan markets across the continental United States. The locations of our plants enable us to efficiently manufacture and distribute beverages to substantially all geographic markets in the United States
 including all of the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas. Each manufacturing facility is generally equipped to produce both canned and bottled beverage products in a variety of package sizes. We utilize numerous package types and sizes
 including cans ranging from eight to sixteen ounces and bottles ranging from ten ounces to three liters. 

We believe that the innovative and controlled vertical integration of our bottling facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely upon independent third party bottlers to manufacture and market their products. Since we control the national production
 distribution and marketing of our brands
 we believe we can more effectively manage product quality and customer service and respond quickly to changing market conditions. 

We produce a substantial portion of the flavor concentrates used in our branded products. By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network
 we can manufacture our products in accordance with uniform quality standards while tailoring flavors to regional taste preferences. We believe that the combination of a Company-owned bottling network
 together with uniform standards for packaging
 formulations and customer service
 provides us with a strategic advantage in servicing national retailers and mass-merchandisers. We also maintain research and development laboratories at multiple locations. These laboratories continually test products for compliance with our strict quality control standards as well as conduct research for new products and flavors.



We utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products through three primary distribution channels: take-home
 convenience and food-service. 

The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores
 warehouse clubs
 mass-merchandisers
 wholesalers and dollar stores. We distribute our products to this channel through the warehouse distribution system and the direct-store delivery system. Under the warehouse distribution system
 products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities to the retailer&#8217;s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its outlet locations with other goods. Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer&#8217;s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.








We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors. The convenience channel consists of convenience stores
 gas stations and other smaller &#8220;up-and-down-the-street&#8221; accounts. Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail
 we have undertaken several measures to expand convenience channel distribution. These include development of products
 packaging and graphics specifically targeted to this market.

Our food-service division distributes products to independent
 specialized distributors who sell to hospitals
 schools
 military bases
 airlines
 hotels and food-service wholesalers. Also
 our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other food-service customers. 

Our take-home
 convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands. We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers. We believe vending and cooler equipment increases beverage sales
 enhances brand awareness and develops brand loyalty.



We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as specialized broker networks. Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market
 focusing on one or more geographic territories
 distribution channels or product lines. We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level
 responsive service and support to our customers and markets.

The emphasis of our sales and marketing programs is to maintain and enhance consumer brand recognition and loyalty
 typically through a combination of regional advertising
 special event marketing
 endorsements
 sponsorships and social media
 along with consumer coupon distribution and product sampling. We retain advertising agencies to assist with media advertising programs for our brands. Additionally
 we offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers
 including cooperative advertising support
 in-store advertising materials and other incentives. These elements allow us to tailor our marketing and advertising programs to meet local and regional economic conditions and demographics. Additionally
 we sponsor special holiday promotions which feature St. Nick&#8217;s soft drink and special holiday flavors and packaging.



Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of raw materials and packaging goods. By consolidating the purchasing function for our manufacturing facilities
 we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers
 thereby enhancing our ability to compete as a low-cost producer of beverages.

The products we produce and sell are made from various materials including sweeteners
 juice concentrates
 carbon dioxide
 water
 glass and plastic bottles
 aluminum cans and ends
 paper
 cartons and closures. Most of our low-calorie soft drink products use sucralose
 aspartame
 stevia or acesulfame potassium. We manufacture a substantial portion of our flavor concentrates and purchase remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers. 

Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers
 although strikes
 weather conditions
 utility shortages
 governmental control or regulations
 national emergencies
 quality
 price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials. A significant portion of our raw material purchases
 including aluminum cans
 plastic bottles
 high fructose corn syrup
 corrugated packaging and juice concentrates
 are derived from commodities. Therefore
 pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide commodity market conditions. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. In certain cases
 we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers
 the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing
 minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations. Additionally
 we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.










The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months. We have sufficient production capacity to meet seasonal increases without maintaining significant quantities of inventory in anticipation of periods of peak demand. Additionally
 our sales can be influenced by weather conditions. 



The beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position varies in each of our market areas. Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment
 including soft drinks
 water products
 juices
 fruit drinks
 powdered drinks
 coffees
 teas
 energy drinks
 sports drinks
 dairy-based drinks
 functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages. We compete with bottlers and distributors of national
 regional and private label products. Several competitors
 including the two that dominate the soft drink industry
 PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company
 have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products can adversely affect sales of our brands. Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity
 advertising and marketing programs
 point-of-sale merchandising
 retail space management
 customer service
 product differentiation
 packaging innovations and distribution methods. We believe our Company differentiates itself through a diversified product portfolio
 strong regional brand recognition
 innovative flavor variety
 attractive packaging
 efficient distribution methods
 specialized advertising and
 for some product lines
 value pricing.







The production
 distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Lanham Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal
 state and local statutes regulating the production
 transportation
 sale
 safety
 advertising
 labeling and ingredients of such products. We believe that we are in compliance
 in all material respects
 with such existing legislation.








Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers. These requirements vary by each jurisdiction. Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities
 as well as by Congress. We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business
 financial condition or results of operations.

All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal
 state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position. We believe that our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law. Compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 



As of May 2
 2015
 we employed approximately 1
200 people
 of which approximately 300 are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.



Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K
 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
 Current Reports on Form 8-K
 proxy statements and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at www.nationalbeverage.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition
 our Code of Ethics is available on our website. The information on the Company&#8217;s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report that we file with
 or furnish to
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. 



In addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company&#8217;s business. Our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties
 including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company
 or that the Company currently deems immaterial
 may also impair our business and results of operations. 

 There has been an increasing focus on health and wellness by beverage consumers
 which may reduce demand for caloric carbonated soft drinks and increase the consumption of products perceived to deliver health
 wellness and/or functionality. If we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics
 consumer trends
 health concerns and product preferences
 our financial results could be adversely affected.

The beverage industry is extremely competitive. Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products
 most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial
 marketing and distribution resources. In order to generate future revenues and profits
 we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. Discounting and other actions by our competitors may make it more difficult to sustain revenues and profits.










 The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials
 including aluminum
 resin
 corn
 linerboard
 water and fruit juice. In addition
 the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources
 including natural gas
 fuel and electricity. These items are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors. Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy. We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken. In addition
 strikes
 weather conditions
 governmental controls
 national emergencies
 natural disasters
 supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply of raw materials and energy. If raw materials or energy costs increase
 or the availability is limited
 our financial results could be adversely affected.

Our business and properties are subject to various federal
 state and local laws and regulations
 including those governing the production
 packaging
 quality
 labeling and distribution of beverage products. In addition
 various governmental agencies have considered limiting the consumption of and imposing additional taxes on soft drinks and other sweetened beverages
 including those sweetened with high fructose corn syrup. Changes in existing laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.

 Our profitability is affected by the cost of medical and retirement benefits provided to employees. In recent years
 we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of certain factors beyond our control. Although we seek to limit these cost increases
 continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability. 

 Unfavorable weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Unusually cold or rainy weather may temporarily reduce demand for our products and contribute to lower sales
 which could adversely affect our profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which we do business could lead to restrictions on the use of water
 which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and distribute products.

 Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees
 both individually and as a group
 and our ability to retain and motivate them. Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them. If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel
 our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected.














Our principal properties include twelve manufacturing facilities located in ten states
 which aggregate approximately two million square feet. We own ten manufacturing facilities in the following states: California (2)
 Georgia
 Kansas
 Michigan (2)
 Ohio
 Texas
 Utah and Washington. Two manufacturing facilities
 located in Maryland and Florida
 are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2020. We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet our present needs. 

The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change. The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature
 such as the industry&#8217;s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields. We are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.

We own and lease trucks
 vans and automobiles used in the sale
 delivery and distribution of our products. In addition
 we lease office and warehouse space
 transportation equipment
 office equipment and certain manufacturing equipment.



From time to time
 we are a party to various litigation matters and claims&nbsp;arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

 2014 (&#8220;Fiscal 2014&#8221;). The higher sales resulted from a 1.1% increase in case volume partially offset by a .4% decline in average selling price per unit. The increase in case volume reflects a 2.9% increase in branded volume
 including a 15.3% case volume growth for our Power+ Brands
 partially offset by a decline in Allied Brands. The decline in selling price per unit is related to changes in product mix. 

Net sales for the fiscal year ended May 3
 2014 decreased 3.2% to $641.1 million as compared to $662.0 million for the fiscal year ended April 27
 2013 (&#8220;Fiscal 2013&#8221;). The lower sales resulted from a 7.5% volume decline in Carbonated Soft Drinks
 principally due to extended periods of unfavorable weather conditions and industry-wide consumption decline. This volume decline was partially offset by case volume growth of 8.2% for our Power+ Brands. Average net selling price per case was approximately the same for both years. 




Gross profit was 33.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2014
 which represents a 1.1% margin improvement compared to Fiscal 2013. The gross margin improvement is primarily due to favorable product mix changes and lower raw material costs. Cost of sales decreased 1.7% on a per case basis. 

Shipping and handling costs are included in selling
 general and administrative expenses
 the classification of which is consistent with many beverage companies. However
 our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Selling
 General and Administrative Expenses
Selling
 general and administrative expenses were $145.2 million or 22.5% of net sales for Fiscal 2015 compared to $153.2 million or 23.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 expenses reflect lower selling and marketing costs. 

Selling
 general and administrative expenses were $153.2 million or 23.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2014 compared to $146.2 million or 22.1% of net sales for Fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 expenses reflect higher selling and marketing costs
 primarily due to increased advertising expenses. 


Interest expense is comprised of interest on borrowings and fees related to maintaining lines of credit. The Company paid a special cash dividend of $118.1 million ($2.55 per common share) on December 27
 2012 from available cash and borrowings under our credit facilities. Due to repayments on borrowings
 interest expense decreased to $371
000 in Fiscal 2015 from $660
000 in Fiscal 2014 and $403
000 in Fiscal 2013. Other expense is net of interest income of $30
000 for Fiscal 2015
 $15
000 for Fiscal 2014 and $37
000 for Fiscal 2013. The change in interest income for Fiscal 2015
 Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 is due to changes in average invested balances. Other income for Fiscal 2015 includes a $1.3 million gain on sale of property.








Our effective tax rate was approximately 34% for Fiscal 2015
 30.9% for Fiscal 2014 and 33.4% for Fiscal 2013. The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes
 the manufacturing deduction and
 for Fiscal 2014
 adjustment of unrecognized tax benefits related to the resolution of certain open tax years. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.




Our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities. At May 2
 2015
 we maintained $100 million unsecured revolving credit facilities
 of which $10 million of borrowings were outstanding and $2.2 million were reserved for standby letters of credit. We believe that existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the next twelve months. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We continually evaluate capital projects to expand our production capacity
 enhance packaging capabilities or improve efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities. Expenditures for property
 plant and equipment amounted to $11.6 million for Fiscal 2015. There were no material capital expenditure commitments at May 2
 2015.

On January 25
 2013
 the Company sold 400
000 shares of Special Series D Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series D Preferred&#8221;)
 par value $1 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million. On May 2
 2014
 the Company redeemed 160
000 shares of Series D Preferred
 representing 40% of the amount outstanding
 for an aggregate price of $8 million. On August 1
 2014
 The Company redeemed 120
000 shares of Series D Preferred
 representing 50% of the amount outstanding
 for an aggregate price of $6 million. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company paid special cash dividends on common stock of $118.1 million ($2.55 per share) on December 27
 2012. 

Pursuant to a management agreement
 we incurred a fee to Corporate Management Advisors
 Inc. (&#8220;CMA&#8221;) of $6.5 million for Fiscal 2015
 $6.4 million for Fiscal 2014 and $6.6 million for Fiscal 2013. At May 2
 2015
 management fees payable to CMA were $1.6 million. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


During Fiscal 2015
 $58.0 million was provided by operating activities
 $9.7 million was used in investing activities and $25.8 million was used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased $5.6 million primarily due to increased earnings. Cash used in investing activities decreased $2.3 million reflecting lower capital expenditures and proceeds of $1.9 from the sale of property. Cash used in financing activities was $25.8 million which included a $6 million redemption of preferred stock and $20 million in principal repayments under credit facilities. 

During Fiscal 2014
 $52.4 million was provided by operating activities
 $12.1 million was used in investing activities and $28.7 million was used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased $12.1 million primarily due to changes in working capital. Cash used in investing activities increased $2.4 million reflecting higher capital expenditures in Fiscal 2014. Cash used in financing activities was $28.7 million reflecting an $8 million redemption of preferred stock and $20 million in principal repayments under credit facilities. 









During Fiscal 2015
 our working capital increased $22.9 million to $101.5 million primarily due to cash generated from operating activities. Trade receivables increased $1.7 million due to higher sales activity and days sales outstanding improved from 34.7 days to 33.1 days. Inventories decreased $1.0 million and annual inventory turns improved from 9.4 to 10.2 times. At May 2
 2015
 the current ratio was 2.5 to 1 as compared to 2.2 to 1 at May 3
 2014.

During Fiscal 2014
 our working capital increased $11.1 million to $78.6 million primarily due to cash generated from operating activities. Trade receivables decreased $5.9 million due to lower sales activity and days sales outstanding remain unchanged at 34.7 days. Inventories increased $4.7 million primarily due to higher quantities related to new products and to support more frequent customer promotions. At May 3
 2014
 the current ratio was 2.2 to 1 as compared to 2.1 to 1 at April 27
 2013.



Contractual obligations at May 2
 2015 are payable as follows:
















































































































































As of May 2
 2015
 we guaranteed the residual value of certain leased equipment in the amount of $4.9 million. If the proceeds from the sale of such equipment are less than the balance required by the lease when the lease terminates on August 1
 2017
 the Company shall be required to pay the difference up to such guaranteed amount. The Company expects to have no loss on such guarantee. 

We contribute to certain pension plans under collective bargaining agreements and to a discretionary profit sharing plan. Total contributions were $2.7 million for Fiscal 2015
 $2.7 million for Fiscal 2014 and $2.6 million for Fiscal 2013. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability
 medical and workers&#8217; compensation exposures. Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance
 based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience. Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly
 we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for specific periods and therefore have not been included in the table above. Standby letters of credit aggregating $2.2 million have been issued in connection with our self-insurance programs. These standby letters of credit expire through March 2016 and are expected to be renewed.










We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have
 or are reasonably likely to have
 a current or future material effect on our financial condition.



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management&#8217;s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future
 they may ultimately differ from actual results. We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For these policies
 we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.


We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer&#8217;s financial condition
 generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer. We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances
 credit conditions and historical write-offs. 


All long-lived assets
 excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization
 are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or
 for goodwill
 the carrying amount of its reporting unit
 is greater than its fair value.


Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable. Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed
 more likely than not
 that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.


We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability
 medical and workers&#8217; compensation exposures. Accordingly
 we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.


We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets. When the incentive is paid in advance
 we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise
 we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume. The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts. 










National Beverage and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial
 operational and business performance
 achievements
 objectives and strategies. These statements are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders. Certain statements including
 without limitation
 statements containing the words believes, anticipates, intends, plans, expects, and estimates constitute forward-looking statements and involve known and unknown risk
 uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results
 performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results
 performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include
 but are not limited to
 the following: general economic and business conditions
 pricing of competitive products
 success in acquiring other beverage businesses
 success of new product and flavor introductions
 fluctuations in the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies
 ability to pass along cost increases to our customers
 labor strikes or work stoppages or other interruptions in the employment of labor
 continued retailer support for our products
 changes in consumer preferences and our success in creating products geared toward consumers&#8217; tastes
 success in implementing business strategies
 changes in business strategy or development plans
 government regulations
 taxes or fees imposed on the sale of our products
 unseasonably cold 
wet weather conditions or droughts and other factors referenced in this report
 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports to our stockholders. We disclaim an obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.




We purchase various raw materials
 including aluminum cans
 plastic bottles
 high fructose corn syrup
 corrugated packaging and juice concentrates
 the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. At times
 we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain commodities. Additionally
 we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.


At May 2
 2015
 the Company had $10 million in borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of 1.0%. Interest rate hedging products are not currently used to mitigate risk from interest fluctuations. If the interest rate on our debt changed by 100 basis points (1%)
 our interest expense for Fiscal 2015 would have changed by approximately $200
000.&nbsp;

National Beverage Corp. develops
 manufactures
 markets and sells a diverse portfolio of flavored beverage products primarily in North America. Incorporated in Delaware in 1985
 National Beverage Corp. is a holding company for various operating subsidiaries. When used in this report
 the terms &#8220;we
&#8221; &#8220;us
&#8221; &#8220;our
&#8221; &#8220;Company&#8221; and &#8220;National Beverage&#8221; mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries. 














The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National Beverage Corp. and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Our fiscal year ends the Saturday closest to April 30 and
 as a result
 an additional week is added every five or six years. Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2013 consisted of 52 weeks while Fiscal 2014 consisted of 53 weeks. 








Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated in a similar manner
 but includes the dilutive effect of stock options amounting to 206
000 shares in Fiscal 2015
 188
000 shares in Fiscal 2014 and 172
000 shares in Fiscal 2013. 


The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate and lack of prepayment penalty. The estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments. These values represent the estimated amounts we would receive upon sale
 taking into consideration current market prices and credit worthiness. See Note 6. 


All long-lived assets
 excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization
 are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the best information available. Estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or
 for goodwill
 the carrying amount of its reporting unit
 is greater than its fair value.









Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable. Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed
 more likely than not
 that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.


We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability
 medical and workers&#8217; compensation exposures. Accordingly
 we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience. At May 2
 2015 and May 3
 2014
 other liabilities included accruals of $5.9 million and $6.1 million
 respectively
 for estimated non-current risk retention exposures
 of which $4.7 million and $5.1 million were covered by insurance.


Intangible assets as of May 2
 2015 and May 3
 2014 consisted of non-amortizable trademarks. 


Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in
 first-out cost or market. Inventories at May 2
 2015 were comprised of finished goods of $24.9 million and raw materials of $18.0 million. Inventories at May 3
 2014 were comprised of finished goods of $27.2 million and raw materials of $16.7 million. 


We are involved in a variety of marketing programs
 including cooperative advertising programs with customers
 to advertise and promote our products to consumers. Marketing costs are expensed when incurred
 except for prepaid advertising and production costs which are expensed when the advertising takes place. Marketing costs
 which are included in selling
 general and administrative expenses
 totaled $42.4 million in Fiscal 2015
 $50.2 million in Fiscal 2014 and $44.6 million in Fiscal 2013. 


In May 2014
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09
 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2014-09&#8221;).&nbsp; ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods or services.&nbsp;ASU 2014-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 30
 2017.&nbsp; We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Property
 Plant and Equipment
Property
 plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Additions
 replacements and betterments are capitalized
 while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed
 the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.









Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer
 which generally occurs upon delivery. Our policy is not to allow the return of products once they have been accepted by the customer. However
 on occasion
 we have accepted returns or issued credit to customers
 primarily for damaged goods. The amounts have been immaterial and
 accordingly
 we do not provide a specific valuation allowance for sales returns.


We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets. When the incentive is paid in advance
 we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise
 we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume. The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts. 


We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance. As such
 the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management. We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and
 therefore
 it is impractical to present such information.


Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling
 general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Such costs aggregated $44.4 million in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 and $44.2 million in Fiscal 2013. Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies
 our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.












We record trade receivables at net realizable value
 which includes an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts. We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer&#8217;s financial condition
 generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer. We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances
 credit conditions and historical write-offs. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:




















































































As of May 2
 2015 and May 3
 2014
 we did not have any customer that comprised more than 10% of trade receivables. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during any of the last three fiscal years. 


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management&#8217;s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions
 actual results may vary from reported amounts.

At May 2
 2015
 a subsidiary of the Company maintained unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks aggregating $100 million (the &#8220;Credit Facilities&#8221;). The Credit Facilities expire from October 10
 2017 to June 18
 2018 and current borrowings bear interest at .9% above one-month LIBOR (1.0% at May 2
 2015). Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities were $10 million at May 2
 2015 and $30 million at May 3
 2014. At May 2
 2015
 $2.2 million of the Credit Facilities were reserved for standby letters of credit and $87.8 million were available for borrowings. 

The Credit Facilities require the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios
 principally debt to net worth and debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities)
 and contain other restrictions
 none of which are expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial position. At May 2
 2015
 we were in compliance with all loan covenants. 










The Company paid special cash dividends on common stock of $118.1 million ($2.55 per share) on December 27
 2012.

On January 25
 2013
 the Company sold 400
000 shares of Special Series D Preferred Stock
 par value $1 per share (&#8220;Series D Preferred&#8221;) for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million. Series D Preferred has a liquidation preference of $50 per share and accrues dividends on this amount at an annual rate of 3% through April 30
 2014 and
 thereafter
 at an annual rate equal to 370 basis points above the 3-Month LIBOR. Dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly. Accrued dividends at May 2
 2015 and May 3
 2014 were $37
000 and $90
000
 respectively. The Series D Preferred is nonvoting and redeemable at the option of the Company beginning May 1
 2014 at $50 per share. The net proceeds of $19.7 million were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Facilities. In addition
 the Company has 150
000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock
 par value $1 per share
 which are held as treasury stock and
 therefore
 such shares have no liquidation value.

On May 2
 2014
 the Company redeemed 160
000 shares of Series D Preferred
 representing 40% of the amount outstanding
 for an aggregate price of $8 million plus accrued dividends. In connection therewith
 the Company accreted and charged to retained earnings $118
000 of original issuance costs
 which was deducted from income available to common shareholders for earnings per share calculation. In conjunction with the partial redemption
 the annual dividend rate on the outstanding Series D Preferred was reduced to 2.5% for the twelve month period beginning May 1
 2014. In evaluating the impact of the rate change
 the Company determined that the related fair value change was immaterial and that no adjustment was required. 

On August 1
 2014
 the Company redeemed 120
000 shares of Series D Preferred
 representing 50% of the amount outstanding
 for an aggregate price of $6 million plus accrued dividends. In connection therewith
 the Company accreted and charged to retained earnings $89
000 of original issuance costs
 which was deducted from income available to common shareholders for earnings per share calculation. 

On May 1
 2015
 the Company and the holders of the Series D Preferred agreed to extend the 2.5% annual dividend rate on the outstanding Series D Preferred through April 30
 2016. In evaluating the impact of the rate change
 the Company determined that the related fair value change was immaterial and that no adjustment was required.








In April 2012
 the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company&#8217;s Stock Buyback Program from 800
000 to 1.6 million shares of common stock. As of May 2
 2015
 502
060 shares were purchased under the program and 1
097
940 shares were available for purchase. There were no shares purchased during the last three fiscal years.

The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors
 Inc. (&#8220;CMA&#8221;)
 a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time. In 1994
 one of those public entities
 through a merger
 no longer was managed in this manner. Under the terms of the agreement
 CMA provides
 subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company
 (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company&#8217;s financial
 legal
 executive recruitment
 internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions
 dispositions and financings by the Company
 including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates
 negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction. CMA
 through its personnel
 also provides
 to the extent possible
 the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company
 its products and corporate image. In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement
 CMA employs numerous individuals
 whom
 acting as a unit
 provide management
 administrative and creative functions for the Company. The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company
 and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA. The Board of Directors on numerous occasions contemplated incentive compensation and
 while shareholder value has increased over 2
000% since the inception of this agreement
 no incentive compensation has been paid. We incurred management fees to CMA of $6.5 million for Fiscal 2015
 $6.4 million for Fiscal 2014 and $6.6 million for Fiscal 2013. Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $1.6 million at May 2
 2015 and at May 3
 2014.


















From time to time
 we enter into aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans. Such financial instruments are designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly
 gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) and reclassified into earnings through cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial. The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2015
 Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013:
























































































































































































As of May 2
 2015
 the notional amount of our outstanding aluminum swap contracts was $38.0 million and
 assuming no change in the commodity prices
 $3.0 million of unrealized loss before tax will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized in earnings over the next 12 months. See Note 1. 

As of May 2
 2015
 the fair value of the derivative liability and derivative long-term liability was $3.0 million and $751
000
 which was included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities
 respectively. As of May 3
 2014
 the fair value of the derivative asset was $5
000
 which was included in prepaid and other assets. Such valuation does not entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level 2 as defined by the fair value hierarchy as they are observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 












































































































Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of May 2
 2015 and May 3
 2014 consisted of the following:












































































































































































































State income taxes
 net of federal benefit








































































During April 2014
 the Company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its review of the Company&#8217;s federal income tax returns for the three years ended April 2013. No material adjustments were proposed and
 accordingly
 the Company adjusted the related unrecognized tax benefits during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014. 

As of May 2
 2015
 the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1.8 million and $191
000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2015. If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions
 the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $1.2 million. A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits
 which amounts are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
 is as follows: 









































































































 Includes $1
907 related to the Internal Revenue Service review of the Company&#8217;s federal income tax returns for the three years ended April 2013 noted above.








We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of May 2
 2015
 unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $269
000
 of which approximately $82
000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2015. 

We file annual income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position
 for which we have unrecognized tax benefits
 is resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position
 we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome. We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits
 as well as the related interest
 in light of changing facts and circumstances. The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution. Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2013 are subject to examination. Generally
 the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions are subject to examination for fiscal years ending after fiscal 2010. 












The 1991 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the &#8220;Omnibus Plan&#8221;) provides for compensatory awards consisting of (i) stock options or stock awards for up to 4
800
000 shares of common stock
 (ii) stock appreciation rights
 dividend equivalents
 other stock-based awards in amounts up to 4
800
000 shares of common stock and (iii) performance awards consisting of any combination of the above. The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage. The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1
680
000 during any year. Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as may be required by law. Options generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant
 vest over a five-year period and expire after ten years.

The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1
800
000 shares of common stock. Options may be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors. The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient&#8217;s ownership level of common stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period. Also
 the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50
000 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.

The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program (&#8220;KEEP Program&#8221;) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 240
000 shares of common stock to key employees
 consultants
 directors and officers. Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased
 up to a maximum of 6
000 shares in any two-year period. Options under the KEEP Program are forfeited in the event of the sale of shares used to acquire such options. Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 60% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired and the exercise price reduces to the stock par value at the end of the six-year vesting period. 








We account for stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the stock option fair value at date of grant. The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period. Stock options granted were 276
800 shares in Fiscal 2015
 5
245 shares in Fiscal 2014 and 2
000 shares in Fiscal 2013. The weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions for stock options granted are as follows: weighted average expected life of 7.4 years for Fiscal 2015
 8 years for Fiscal 2014 and 8 years for Fiscal 2013; weighted average expected volatility of 32.8% for Fiscal 2015
 35.8% for Fiscal 2014 and 38.1% for Fiscal 2013; weighted average risk free interest rates of 2.2% for Fiscal 2015
 1.9% for Fiscal 2014 and 1.6% for Fiscal 2013; and expected dividend yield of 4.6% for Fiscal 2015
 4.6% for Fiscal 2014 and 5.0% for Fiscal 2013.&nbsp; The expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience.&nbsp; The expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options. &nbsp;The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and ranged from 0% to 16% for Fiscal 2015
 Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.

As of May 2
 2015
 unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of our stock options was $872
000
 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 5.7 years. The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding as of May 2
 2015 was 4.3 years and $6.9 million
 respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options exercisable as of May 2
 2015 was 2.7 years and $4.4 million
 respectively.

We have a stock purchase plan which provides for the purchase of up to 1
536
000 shares of common stock by employees who (i) have been employed for at least two years
 (ii) are not part-time employees and (iii) are not owners of five percent or more of our common stock. As of May 2
 2015
 no shares have been issued under the plan.





















The Company contributes to certain pension plans under collective bargaining agreements and to a discretionary profit sharing plan. Total contributions (including contributions to multi-employer plans reflected below) were $2.7 million for Fiscal 2015
 $2.7 million for Fiscal 2014 and $2.6 million for Fiscal 2013. 

The Company participates in various multi-employer defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees whose employment is covered under collective bargaining agreements. If the Company chooses to stop participating in the multi-employer plan or if other employers choose to withdraw to the extent that a mass withdrawal occurs
 the Company could be required to pay the plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan. 

Summarized below is certain information regarding the Company&#8217;s participation in significant multi-employer pension plans including the financial improvement plan or rehabilitation plan status (&#8220;FIP/RP Status&#8221;) and the zone status under the Pension Protection Act (&#8220;PPA&#8221;). The most recent PPA zone status available in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 is for the plans&#8217; years ending December&nbsp;31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively. 









































Central States
 Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (EIN no. 36-6044243) (the &#8220;CSSS Fund&#8221;)




























For the plan years ended December&nbsp;31
 2013 and December 31
 2012
 the Company was not listed in the Form 5500 Annual Returns as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for the above plans. The collective bargaining agreements expire on October 18
 2016 for the CSSS Fund and May 14
 2016 for the WCT Fund.










































































































The trustees of one of the multi-employer pension plans that is not considered individually significant have notified a subsidiary of the Company that a mass withdrawal has occurred and have provided the subsidiary with a notice of withdrawal liability. The Company disputes various aspects of the withdrawal liability calculations and intends to challenge them in accordance with applicable Federal laws. The Company anticipates that the amount of its liability
 if any
&nbsp;will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.


















We lease buildings
 machinery and equipment under various non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2023. Certain of these leases contain scheduled rent increases and/or renewal options. Contractual rent increases are taken into account when calculating the minimum lease payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent expense under operating lease agreements totaled approximately $8.2 million for Fiscal 2015
 $7.9 million for Fiscal 2014 and $8.9 million for Fiscal 2013.

Our minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of May 2
 2015 were as follows: 


































































As of May 2
 2015
 we guaranteed the residual value of certain leased equipment in the amount of $4.9 million. If the proceeds from the sale of such equipment are less than the balance required by the lease when the lease terminates on August 1
 2017
 the Company shall be required to pay the difference up to such guaranteed amount. The Company expects to have no loss on such guarantee. 

We enter into various agreements with suppliers for the purchase of raw materials
 the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing and minimum purchase quantities. As of May 2
 2015
 we had purchase commitments for raw materials of $54.0 million for Fiscal 2016.

From time to time
 we are a party to various litigation matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National Beverage Corp. as of May 2
 2015 and May 3
 2014 and the related consolidated statements of income
 comprehensive income
 shareholders&#39; equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 2
 2015. We also have audited National Beverage Corp.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of May 2
 2015
 based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. National Beverage Corp.&#8217;s management is responsible for these financial statements
 for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the company&#39;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of National Beverage Corp. as of May 2
 2015 and May 3
 2014 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 2
 2015
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion
 National Beverage Corp. maintained
 in all material respects
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 2
 2015
 based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of the Company&#8217;s management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our &#8220;disclosure controls and procedures&#8221; (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)). Based upon that evaluation
 the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1)&nbsp;recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2)&nbsp;accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 


Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on that evaluation
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 2
 2015. 

Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting
 including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly
 even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further
 because of changes in conditions
 the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time. 

McGladrey LLP
 an independent registered public accounting firm
 has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and
 as part of their audit
 has issued their report
 included herein
 on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 


There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended May 2
 2015 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 we enter into aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans. Such financial instruments are designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly
 gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (&amp;#x201c;AOCI&amp;#x201d;) and reclassified into earnings through cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial. The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2015

The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage. The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1

The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient&amp;#x2019;s ownership level of common stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period. Also
 the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50

 2015 and May 3
















 the Company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its review of the Company&amp;#x2019;s federal income tax returns for the three years ended April 2013. No material adjustments were proposed and
 accordingly

 2015
 the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1.8 million and $191
000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2015. If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions
 the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $1.2 million. A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits
 which amounts are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets









 2015
 unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $269
000
 of which approximately $82

 for which we have unrecognized tax benefits
 is resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position
 we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome. We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits
 as well as the related interest
 in light of changing facts and circumstances. The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution. Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2013 are subject to examination. Generally

 2014 and
 thereafter
 at an annual rate equal to 370 basis points above the 3-Month LIBOR. Dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly. Accrued dividends at May 2

 2014
 the Company redeemed 160

 which was deducted from income available to common shareholders for earnings per share calculation. In conjunction with the partial redemption
 the annual dividend rate on the outstanding Series D Preferred was reduced to 2.5% for the twelve month period beginning May 1

 2014
 the Company redeemed 120

 Inc. (&amp;#x201c;CMA&amp;#x201d;)
 a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time. In 1994
 one of those public entities
 through a merger
 no longer was managed in this manner. Under the terms of the agreement
 CMA provides
 subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company
 (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company&amp;#x2019;s financial
 legal
 executive recruitment
 internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions
 dispositions and financings by the Company
 including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates
 negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction. CMA
 through its personnel
 also provides
 to the extent possible
 the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company
 its products and corporate image. In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement
 CMA employs numerous individuals
 whom
 acting as a unit
 provide management
 administrative and creative functions for the Company. The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company
 and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA. The Board of Directors on numerous occasions contemplated incentive compensation and
 while shareholder value has increased over 2
000% since the inception of this agreement
 no incentive compensation has been paid. We incurred management fees to CMA of $6.5 million for Fiscal 2015
 $6.4 million for Fiscal 2014 and $6.6 million for Fiscal 2013. Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $1.6 million at May 2

The maximum number of shares (or other type of equity) originally approved per individual (usually by shareholders and board of directors)
 net of any subsequent amendments and adjustments
 for awards under the equity-based compensation plan. As stock or unit options and equity instruments other than options are awarded to participants
 the shares or units remain authorized and become reserved for issuance under outstanding awards (not necessarily vested).



















































































































Represents information about the period in which participants in the Key Employee Equity Partnership Program who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased
 up to a maximum of 6
000 shares.




























Represents the expense recognized during the period arising from equity-based compensation arrangements (for example
 shares of stock
 unit
 stock options or other equity instruments) with employees
 directors and certain consultants qualifying for treatment as employees.

























































Weighted average period over which unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized for equity-based compensation plans
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format

 five months
 and thirteen days.

























































The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (&#x201c;GAAP&#x201d;) and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National Beverage Corp. and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Our fiscal year ends the Saturday closest to April 30 and
 as a result
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated in a similar manner
 but includes the dilutive effect of stock options amounting to 206
000 shares in Fiscal 2015
 188
000 shares in Fiscal 2014 and 172
The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate and lack of prepayment penalty. The estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments. These values represent the estimated amounts we would receive upon sale
All long-lived assets
 excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization
 are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the best information available. Estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or

Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable. Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed
 more likely than not
We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability
 medical and workers&#x2019; compensation exposures. Accordingly
 we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience. At May 2
 2015 and May 3
 2014
 other liabilities included accruals of $5.9 million and $6.1 million
 respectively
 for estimated non-current risk retention exposures
Intangible assets as of May 2
 2015 and May 3
Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in
 first-out cost or market. Inventories at May 2
 2015 were comprised of finished goods of $24.9 million and raw materials of $18.0 million. Inventories at May 3
We are involved in a variety of marketing programs
 including cooperative advertising programs with customers
 to advertise and promote our products to consumers. Marketing costs are expensed when incurred
 except for prepaid advertising and production costs which are expensed when the advertising takes place. Marketing costs
 which are included in selling
 general and administrative expenses
 totaled $42.4 million in Fiscal 2015
In May 2014
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09
 &#x201c;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#x201d; (&#x201c;ASU 2014-09&#x201d;).&nbsp; ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods or services.&nbsp;ASU 2014-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 30
Property
Property
 plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Additions
 replacements and betterments are capitalized
 while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed
Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer
 which generally occurs upon delivery. Our policy is not to allow the return of products once they have been accepted by the customer. However
 on occasion
 we have accepted returns or issued credit to customers
 primarily for damaged goods. The amounts have been immaterial and
 accordingly
We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets. When the incentive is paid in advance
 we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise
We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance. As such
 the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management. We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and
 therefore
Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling
 general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Such costs aggregated $44.4 million in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 and $44.2 million in Fiscal 2013. Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies
We record trade receivables at net realizable value
 which includes an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts. We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer&#x2019;s financial condition
 generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer. We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances
As of May 2
 2015 and May 3
 2014
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management&#x2019;s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions
 actual results may vary from reported amounts.

 the Company sold 400
000 shares of Special Series D Preferred Stock
 par value $1 per share (&#x201c;Series D Preferred&#x201d;) for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million. Series D Preferred has a liquidation preference of $50 per share and accrues dividends on this amount at an annual rate of 3% through April 30
 2014 and
 thereafter
 at an annual rate equal to 370 basis points above the 3-Month LIBOR. Dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly. Accrued dividends at May 2

The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors
 Inc. (&#x201c;CMA&#x201d;)
 a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time. In 1994
 one of those public entities
 through a merger
 no longer was managed in this manner. Under the terms of the agreement
 CMA provides
 subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company
 (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company&#x2019;s financial
 legal
 executive recruitment
 internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions
 dispositions and financings by the Company
 including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates
 negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction. CMA
 through its personnel
 also provides
 to the extent possible
 the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company
 its products and corporate image. In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement
 CMA employs numerous individuals
 whom
 acting as a unit
 provide management
 administrative and creative functions for the Company. The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company
 and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA. The Board of Directors on numerous occasions contemplated incentive compensation and
 while shareholder value has increased over 2
000% since the inception of this agreement
 no incentive compensation has been paid. We incurred management fees to CMA of $6.5 million for Fiscal 2015
 $6.4 million for Fiscal 2014 and $6.6 million for Fiscal 2013. Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $1.6 million at May 2
 2015 and at May 3
 2014.



































The entire disclosure for shareholders' equity comprised of portions attributable to the parent entity and noncontrolling interest
 including other comprehensive income. Includes
 but is not limited to
 balances of common stock
 preferred stock
 additional paid-in capital
 other capital and retained earnings
 accumulated balance for each classification of other comprehensive income and amount of comprehensive income.
