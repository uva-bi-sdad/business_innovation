Acquisition of Trace Analytics
On January 7
 2019
 the Company closed on a purchase of 520
410 shares of common stock of Trace Analytics
 Inc.
 a Washington corporation (&#8220;Trace Analytics&#8221;). Pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
 the Company purchased Trace Analytics at a purchase price of $2.40 per share
 for an aggregate purchase price of $1
250
000
 of which $750
000 was paid in cash and $500
000 was paid through the issuance of shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Trace Analytics is a cannabis testing laboratory acquired to enable the Company to position itself as the leading provider of testing solutions for CBD products for both compliance requirements and consumer safety as these products continue to increase in popularity. Immediately following the purchase
 the Company holds 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Trace Analytics. The Common Stock Purchase Agreement included the option for Trace to repurchase 205
410 shares of Common Stock based on the occurrence of certain Repurchase Triggering Events. Based on a review of the Repurchase Triggering Events
 it is considered unlikely that any of the events will occur. Additionally
The Company has included the financial results of Trace Analytics in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition
 January 1
 2019. The purchase price for Trace Analytics was $1
250
000. Based on management&#8217;s analysis of the acquisition transaction pursuant to the provisions of ASC 805
 the Company determined that any customer lists or business licenses held by Trace Analytics are immaterial in relation to the overall value of Trace; additionally
 Trace Analytics does not hold any patents or proprietary technology
 and does not have long-term contractual arrangements with customers. As such
 there are no separately identifiable intangible assets meeting the criteria of ASC 805. Concurrently
 the Company preliminarily allocated the $1
941
149 excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets of $509

: Revenue relate to shipments of cannabidiol (&#8220;CBD&#8221;) brand products and lab testing services. During our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 we earned revenue from our CBD product lines of $543
970 as compared to $197
554 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. The increase reflects higher sales from our expansion of our CBD brand product lines. Service revenue resulting from our lab testing is attributed solely to the acquisition of Trace Analytics on January 1
 2019
 and totaled $163
: Cost of goods sold is driven by product sales
 and primarily consists of purchases of inventory for sale. We generally purchase products that are private labels and brand the products using our tradenames. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 we incurred $498
993 of costs to purchase product which represented 91% of our product revenues as compared to $155
549 or 80% of our product revenues for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019. Cost of services of $22
781 is related to lab testing
 and is attributed solely to the acquisition of Trace Analytics on January 1
: For our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 gross margin from sale of our CBD products was $44
977 or 8% of our revenue as compared to $42
005 or 21% of our revenue for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. The lower gross margin percentage is primarily due a significant portion of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 derived from lower margin bulk sales of industrial Hemp. Gross margin from our lab testing services
 which started January 1
 2019
 totaled $140
: Sales and marketing expenses mainly comprised of advertising
 public relations
 events
 and website marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $698
185 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to $356
948 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. The majority of the increase related to public relation services

 travel expenses
 meals and entertainment and other office support costs. General and administrative expenses increased $1
139
291 to $2
092
775 for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to $953
484 for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. The majority of the increase related to increased utilization of common stock as compensation for services provided by certain officers
 advisory members and board members which totaled $1
343
690 for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to $598
000 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 driven by efforts to increase overall awareness and aid in raising capital. Additionally
 the acquisition of Trace Analytics in January 2019 contributed $171
132 of general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31
: Depreciation expense was $40
627 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to $224
770 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. The decrease relates to amortization during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 related to a brand that we acquired in February 2017
 which was fully expensed during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. We did not own any similar intangibles that required amortization during our fiscal year ended March 31
: During our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet our expectations. As such
 we were not able to achieve the expected operating results from the VitaCBD brand products. As a result
 we impaired the intangible asset related to the acquisition of the&nbsp;VitaCBD brand name&nbsp;and recorded an impairment charge of $893
667
 which reflected the net book value of the intangible as of March 31
 On April 1
 2018
 we adopted ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. As such
 during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 we measured our equity investments at each reporting period at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. During our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 we were able to obtain observable evidence that certain of our equity investments had increased to a total aggregate value of $898
292
 which was $429
755 higher than the original purchase price of these investments. As such
 we recorded an unrecognized gain from the change in market value of $429
755 during our fiscal year ended March 31
 In February 2019
 we received a distribution of $186
397 from our investment with Bailey Venture Partners XII LLC (&#8220;Bailey&#8221;) through Bailey&#8217;s investment in JUUL Labs
: During our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 we recorded $148
601 of interest costs related to a convertible notes that we entered into during our current fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 along with amortization of $500
A summary of our cash flows for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to our fiscal year ended March 31
Net cash used in operating activities was $905
051 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to $637
467 for our fiscal year ended March 31
Net cash used in investing activities was $713
294 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to $173
236 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. The increase in use of cash was primarily related to $711
739 related to our purchase of Trace Analytics as compared to our acquisition of equity investments of $168
537 during our fiscal year ended March 31
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1
604
455 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to $695
000 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. The increase primarily relates to our issuance of convertible notes totaling $1
529
455 during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 which we did not incur during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 as compared to sales of shares of our common stock which totaled $75
000 during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to $795
000 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. In addition
 during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 we paid $100
000 to repurchase 5
400
Our uses of cash have been primarily for strategic investments we made
 including the purchase of Trace Analytics
 and operations and marketing efforts to promote our products and company. Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by financing
 primarily through the sale of equity securities and issuance of convertible notes. We anticipate that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to expand and bring to market our products and investments before sufficient and consistent positive operating cash flows will be achieved. As such
 we anticipate that additional funds will be needed to continue operations
 obtain profitability and to achieve our objectives. As of the date of this Form 10-K
As reflected in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere is this Form 10-K
 as of March 31
 2019 we had cash on hand and had an accumulated deficit of $47
044 and $5
531
260
 respectively
 and during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 we utilized cash for operations and incurred a net loss of $905
051 and $2
679
022
 respectively. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Further
 our independent auditors in their audit report for our fiscal year ended March 31
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and income from our operations. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 we raised $1
529
455 through the issuance of convertible notes and $75
000 through the receipt of Subscription Agreements (&#8220;Subscription&#8221;) where we sold shares of our common stock to accredited investors. As of March 31
 2019
 we had cash on hand of $47
044. We estimate that such funds will not be sufficient to continue operations without obtaining additional funds. As such
 we are currently working on obtaining additional funds to operate our business through and beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing. However
 there can be no assurance that such funds will be available or at terms acceptable to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing
 it may contain undue restrictions and covenants on our operations
Financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Among other things
 estimates include the collectability of accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 assumptions made in determining impairment of investments and intangible
 useful life of our intangible
 and accruals for potential liabilities. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information and the prediction of future trends
Through March 31
 2018
 we used either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. We used the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which we were considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. We used the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
On April 1
 2018
 we adopted ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As such
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. &nbsp;The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the reporting unit. Estimations and assumptions regarding the number of reporting units
 future performances
 results of the Company&#8217;s operations and comparability of its market capitalization and net book value will be used. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is measured by the resulting amount. Because the Company has one reporting unit
 as part of the Company&#8217;s qualitative assessment an entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment is utilized. No impairment losses have been recorded in the fiscal years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018.&nbsp; The Company has currently recorded goodwill of $1
941
089 representing the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible assets in the acquisition of Trace Analytics.&nbsp; This is considered a provisional allocation of the purchase price and is subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained through the purchase price measurement period (a period of up to one year from the closing date of January 1
The Company accounts for its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting where the cost is allocated to the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired
 based on their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Identifiable assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally
 contingent consideration
 if any. is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired
 net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired

MARCH 31
Applied BioSciences Corp. (formerly First Fixtures
 Inc. and Stony Hill Corp. or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 21
 2014 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. The Company is a vertically integrated company focused on the development of science-driven cannabinoid therapeutics / biopharmaceuticals
Effective October 24
 2016 the Company changed its name from First Fixtures Inc. to Stony Hill Corp and on March 6
 2018
In January 2019
 the Company closed on a purchase of 520
410 shares of common stock of Trace Analytics
 Inc.
 a Washington corporation (&#8220;Trace Analytics&#8221;)
 for an aggregate purchase price of $1
250
000
 of which $750
000 was paid in cash and $500
000 was paid in shares of common stock of the Company. Trace Analytics is a cannabis testing laboratory. Immediately following the purchase
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the consolidated financial statements
 during the year ended March 31
 2019 the Company incurred a net loss of $2
679
022 and used $905
051 of cash in operating activities
 and had a working capital deficiency of $19
807 as of March 31
The Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and income from operations. During the fiscal period ended March 31
 2019
 the Company sold 37
500 shares of its common stock to accredited investors at a price of $2.00 per share for total proceeds of $75
000 and issued convertible notes for total proceeds of approximately $1
600
000 both in private placements to accredited investors. However
 the Company will need and is currently working on obtaining additional funds to operate its business through and beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing. There is no assurance that such funds will be available or at terms acceptable to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing
 it may contain undue restrictions and covenants on its operations
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries
 Applied Products LLC
 VitaCBD LLC
 an 80% owned entity
 Trace Analytics
 Inc.
 a 51% owned entity
 all Washington limited liability companies
 and SHL Management LLC
 a 100% owned entity
MARCH 31
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Among other things
 management estimates include the collectability of its accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 estimates of fair value of equity investments
 assumptions made in determining purchase price allocation
 impairment of investments and intangible assets
 accruals for potential liabilities
 and realization of deferred tax assets. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information and the prediction of future trends
The Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#8221;) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above

The Company&#8217;s revenue is principally derived from its subsidiaries
 Applied Products LLC
Applied Products LLC revenues are generated from sales of high-quality CBD products for consumer and pet health and wellness. Sales of these products were made to individual distributors and through online channels. Revenue from the sale of these products was $543
970 and $197
554 during the years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018
Trace Analytics generates revenue from services by offering state-of-the-art testing and analytics capabilities to CBD and hemp companies. Sales of these services are to marijuana producers and processors
 dispensaries
 and CBD and hemp companies. Revenue from the sale of these&nbsp;services was $163
092 during the years ended March 31
Prior to April 1
 2018
 
Effective April 1
 2018 the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-09
 (Topic 606) (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;) which superseded previous revenue recognition guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts
 which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer
 (2) identifying the Company&#8217;s performance obligations in the contract or agreement
 (3) determining the transaction price
 (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2019 and 2018 amounted to $541
873 and $160
295
 respectively
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on a first-in-first-out average cost basis. Inventories consist of finished goods held for sale. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand and records an inventory provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value
 based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess. There was no provision for inventory obsolescence necessary as of March 31
MARCH 31
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
 net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice and the collection history of each customer to determine whether a specific allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified. As of March 31
 2018
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2
227. The Company did not deem it necessary to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company uses an estimated useful life of three years for employee-related computers and software
 three years for other office equipment and computer hardware
Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Based upon management&#8217;s annual assessment
 there were no indicators of impairment of the Company&#8217;s property and equipment and other long-lived assets as of March 31
Through March 31
 2018
 the Company used either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company used the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company was considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. The Company used the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
On April 1
 2018
 the Company adopted ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As such
MARCH 31
Intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. The Company regularly reviews intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist
 the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
 if any
On February 23
 2017
 the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with mCig
 Inc. for the purchase of the VitaCBD brand name. In connection with the Agreement
 the Company recorded intangible assets of $1
138
135. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet management&#8217;s expectations and the Company was not able to achieve the expected operating results. As a result
 the Company impaired the intangible asset related to the acquisition of the&nbsp;VitaCBD brand name&nbsp;and recorded an impairment charge of $893
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. During the year ended March 31
 2019
 the Company recorded goodwill of $1
941
149 related to the purchase of Trace Analytics (see Note5). The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the reporting unit. Estimations and assumptions regarding the number of reporting units
 future performances
 results of the Company&#8217;s operations and comparability of its market capitalization and net book value will be used. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is measured by the resulting amount. Because the Company has one reporting unit
 as part of the Company&#8217;s qualitative assessment an entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment is utilized. No impairment losses have been recorded in the fiscal years ended March 31
The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions
 for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for share-based payments under the guidance as set forth in the Share-Based Payment Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;)
 which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees
 officers
 directors
 and consultants
 including employee stock options
 based on estimated fair values. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards to employees and directors on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
 and the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the required service period in the Company&#8217;s statements of operations. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Stock-based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised
 as necessary
&nbsp;The Company accounts for its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting where the cost is allocated to the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired
 based on their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Identifiable assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally
 contingent consideration
 if any. is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired
 net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired
MARCH 31
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company operates in one segment for the distribution of products and services. In accordance with the &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; Topic of the ASC
 the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer
 who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance
 which is based on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement
 manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment

In February 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02
 
 which was subsequently amended in 2018 by ASU 2018-10
 ASU 2018-11 and ASU 2018-20 (collectively
 Topic 842). Topic 842 will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. Topic 842 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption
 leases will be recognized and measured at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Topic 842 allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period the new lease standard is adopted and will not require restatement of prior periods. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of Topic 842 on the Company&#8217;s financial statements and disclosures
In July 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-11
 ASU 2017-11 allows companies to exclude a down round feature when determining whether a financial instrument (or embedded conversion feature) is considered indexed to the entity&#8217;s own stock. As a result
 financial instruments (or embedded conversion features) with down round features may no longer be required to be accounted for as derivative liabilities. A company will recognize the value of a down round feature only when it is triggered and the strike price has been adjusted downward. For equity-classified freestanding financial instruments
 an entity will treat the value of the effect of the down round as a dividend and a reduction of income available to common shareholders in computing basic earnings per share. For convertible instruments with embedded conversion features containing down round provisions
 entities will recognize the value of the down round as a beneficial conversion discount to be amortized to earnings. The guidance in ASU 2017-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
 and the guidance is to be applied using a full or modified retrospective approach. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2017-11 on April 1

(A) In November 2016
 the Company purchased 29
571 shares of Preferred A stock of Cannabi-Tech Ltd. (&#8220;Cannabi&#8221;)
 at a price of $1.69086 per share for total investment of $50
000. Cannabi is a private company incorporated in the State of Israel that provides lab-grade medical cannabis quality control testing systems used to test the quality of medical marijuana flowers. Cannabi subsequently changed its name to GemmaCert. In October 2017
 the Company purchased an additional 7
309 shares of Preferred A-1 stock of GemmaCert at a price of $2.536 per share for total investment of $18
537. At March 31
 2019
 the Company revalued all its shares of GemmaCert at $2.536 per share
 the most recent purchase price. This resulted in an aggregate increase in value of $24
992
MARCH 31
As a private company
 GemmaCert does not have a readily determinable fair value. Additionally
 there have been no observable price changes from transactions for similar investments in GemmaCert during the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019. As such
 the Company has measured the value of the investment at cost as of March 31
 2019
(B) In January 2017
 the Company entered in to an agreement to purchase 59
524 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $4.20 per share for total investment of $250
000
 which accounts for less than 5% investment in Hightimes Holdings Corp. (&#8220;Hightimes&#8221;). Hightimes owns High Times Magazine and hosts festivals
 events and competitions including the High Times Cannabis Cup and multiple e-commerce properties
 including HighTimes.com
 CannabisCup.com and 420.com. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 the Company was able to obtain observable evidence that the investment had a market value of $11.00 per share

NOTE 5 &#8211; ACQUISITION OF TRACE ANALYTICS
On January 7
 2019
 the Company closed on a purchase of 520
410 shares of common stock of Trace Analytics
 Inc.
 a Washington corporation (&#8220;Trace Analytics&#8221;). Pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
 the Company purchased Trace Analytics at a purchase price of $2.40 per share
 for an aggregate purchase price of $1
250
000
 of which $750
000 was paid in cash and $500
000 was paid through the issuance of shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Trace Analytics is a cannabis testing laboratory acquired to enable the Company to position itself as the leading provider of testing solutions for CBD products for both compliance requirements and consumer safety as these products continue to increase in popularity. Immediately following the purchase
 the Company holds 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Trace Analytics. The Common Stock Purchase Agreement included the option for Trace to repurchase 205
410 shares of Common Stock based on the occurrence of certain Repurchase Triggering Events. Based on a review of the Repurchase Triggering Events
 it is considered unlikely that any of the events will occur. Additionally
MARCH 31
The Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805 &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221;. The Company is in the process of performing an allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The fair values of the assets acquired
 as set forth below
 are considered provisional and subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained through the purchase price measurement period (a period of up to one year from the closing date). The provisional allocation of the purchase price is based on management&#8217;s preliminary estimates. Once management completes its analysis to finalize the purchase price allocation

Based on management&#8217;s analysis of the acquisition transaction pursuant to the provisions of ASC 805
 the Company determined that any customer lists or business licenses held by Trace Analytics are immaterial in relation to the overall value of Trace; additionally
 Trace Analytics does not hold any patents or proprietary technology
 and does not have long-term contractual arrangements with customers. As such
 there are no separately identifiable intangible assets meeting the criteria of ASC 805. Concurrently
 the Company preliminarily allocated the $1

274 in additional paid-in capital and debt discount representing the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature at the date of the borrowing against the Notes.

 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

As of the end of the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of members of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer (who is our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer)
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Our Chief Executive Officer has concluded
 based on his evaluation
 that as of March 31
 2019
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including the President and Secretary
 as appropriate
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process
 including policies and procedures
&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this assessment
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31
 2019 based on such criteria. Deficiencies existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i) lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and (ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Management believes that the lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures
A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met under all potential conditions
 regardless of how remote
 and may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
In connection with our continued monitoring and maintenance of our controls procedures as part of the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 we continue to review
 test
 and improve the effectiveness of our internal controls. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter and since the year ended March 31
 2019 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect

No director
 nominee for director
As of March 31
 2019
 the Company has no significant employees
Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early business development stage company and has only&nbsp;four directors
 and to date
 such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
There are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities
 file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on our review of filings made on the SEC website
 and the fact of us not receiving certain forms or written representations from certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements
 we believe that
 during the year ended March 31
 2019
 all of our executive officers
We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless
 every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors
 as applicable
 and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications
 and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year
The Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officers
 principal financial officer
 principal accounting officer or controller

Our Board is currently composed of four members. Our Common Stock is not currently listed for trading on a national securities exchange and
 as such
 we are not subject to any director independence standards. However
 we have determined that none of our directors would qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests
 such as that the director is not
 and has not been for at least three years
 one of our employees and that neither the director
 nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition

 in the opinion of our board of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director
 though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations

 the Company recognized its revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605 &lt;i&gt;Revenue Recognition&lt;/i&gt;&#13;

 2018 the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board&amp;#8217;s (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;)&#13;No. 2014-09
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&lt;/i&gt; (Topic 606) (&amp;#8220;ASC 606&amp;#8221;) which superseded previous revenue&#13;recognition guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to&#13;customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment&#13;when considering the terms of contracts
 which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer
 (2) identifying&#13;the Company&amp;#8217;s performance obligations in the contract or agreement
 (3) determining the transaction price
 (4) allocating&#13;the transaction price to the separate performance obligations

 2019 and 2018 amounted to $541

 based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to&#13;assess. There was no provision for inventory obsolescence necessary as of March 31

 net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the&#13;Company&amp;#8217;s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful&#13;accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice and the collection history of each customer to determine whether a&#13;specific allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts&#13;when identified. As of March 31
 2018
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2
227. The Company did not deem it necessary to&#13;provide an allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31

 three years for other office&#13;equipment and computer hardware

 there were no indicators of impairment of the Company&amp;#8217;s property and equipment and other long-lived assets&#13;as of March 31

&#13;2018
 the Company used either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company used the equity method for unconsolidated&#13;equity investments in which the Company was considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. The Company&#13;used the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an&#13;other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary

 2018
&#13;the Company adopted ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &amp;#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial&#13;Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation&#13;and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires certain equity investments&#13;to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As such

 the&#13;Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated&#13;with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
 if&#13;any

&#13;2017
 the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &amp;#8220;Agreement&amp;#8221;) with mCig
 Inc. for the purchase of the&#13;VitaCBD brand name. In connection with the Agreement
 the Company recorded intangible assets of $1
138
135. During the fiscal year&#13;ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet management&amp;#8217;s expectations and the Company was not able to&#13;achieve the expected operating results. As a result
 the Company impaired the intangible asset related to the acquisition of the&amp;#160;VitaCBD&#13;brand name&amp;#160;and recorded an impairment charge of $893

 2019
 the Company recorded goodwill of $1
941
149 related to the purchase&#13;of Trace Analytics (see Note5). The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events and changes&#13;in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its annual impairment analysis in&#13;the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting&#13;unit&amp;#8217;s carrying amount
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the reporting unit. Estimations and assumptions regarding&#13;the number of reporting units
 future performances
 results of the Company&amp;#8217;s operations and comparability of its market capitalization&#13;and net book value will be used. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 goodwill is considered impaired&#13;and an impairment loss is measured by the resulting amount. Because the Company has one reporting unit
 as part of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;qualitative assessment an entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment is utilized. No impairment losses have been recorded&#13;in the fiscal years ended March 31

 for services and for financing&#13;costs. The Company accounts for share-based payments under the guidance as set forth in the Share-Based Payment Topic of the FASB&#13;Accounting Standards Codification (&amp;#8220;ASC&amp;#8221;)
 which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for&#13;all share-based payment awards made to employees
 officers
 directors
 and consultants
 including employee stock options
 based&#13;on estimated fair values. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards to employees and directors on the&#13;date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
 and the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected&#13;to vest is recognized as expense over the required service period in the Company&amp;#8217;s statements of operations. The Company&#13;accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance&#13;whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance&#13;commitment is reached
 or b) the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Stock-based&#13;compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated&#13;at the time of grant and revised
 as necessary

 based on their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated&#13;fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Identifiable assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling&#13;interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally
 contingent consideration
&#13;if any. is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by&#13;which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the&#13;acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired
 net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value&#13;of assets acquired


 the Company&amp;#8217;s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer
 who reviews operating&#13;results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance
 which&#13;is based on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly&#13;and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which the entity&#13;holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &amp;#8220;Segment Reporting&amp;#8221;&#13;due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement
&#13;manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment

&#13;the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02
 &lt;i&gt;Leases&lt;/i&gt;
 which was&#13;subsequently amended in 2018 by ASU 2018-10
 ASU 2018-11 and ASU 2018-20 (collectively
 Topic 842). Topic 842 will require the&#13;recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
&#13;for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease&#13;term on a straight-line basis
 with all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance&#13;leases
 interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement&#13;of comprehensive income and the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity&#13;while the interest component will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. Topic 842 is effective for&#13;annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption
 leases will&#13;be recognized and measured at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Topic 842&#13;allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period the new lease standard is adopted and will not require restatement of prior&#13;periods. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of Topic 842 on the Company&amp;#8217;s financial statements and disclosures

 the&#13;FASB issued ASU 2017-11
 &lt;i&gt;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Accounting for Certain Financial&#13;Instruments with Down Round Features.&lt;/i&gt; ASU 2017-11 allows companies to exclude a down round feature when determining whether&#13;a financial instrument (or embedded conversion feature) is considered indexed to the entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. As a result
 financial&#13;instruments (or embedded conversion features) with down round features may no longer be required to be accounted for as derivative&#13;liabilities. A company will recognize the value of a down round feature only when it is triggered and the strike price has been&#13;adjusted downward. For equity-classified freestanding financial instruments
 an entity will treat the value of the effect of the&#13;down round as a dividend and a reduction of income available to common shareholders in computing basic earnings per share. For&#13;convertible instruments with embedded conversion features containing down round provisions
 entities will recognize the value of&#13;the down round as a beneficial conversion discount to be amortized to earnings. The guidance in ASU 2017-11 is effective for fiscal&#13;years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
 and the guidance&#13;is to be applied using a full or modified retrospective approach. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2017-11 on April 1

 2019
 the Company closed on a purchase of 520
410 shares of common stock of Trace Analytics
 Inc.
 a Washington corporation&#13;(&amp;#8220;Trace Analytics&amp;#8221;). Pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
 the Company purchased Trace Analytics at a purchase&#13;price of $2.40 per share
 for an aggregate purchase price of $1
250
000
 of which $750
000 was paid in cash and $500
000 was paid&#13;through the issuance of shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock. Trace Analytics is a cannabis testing laboratory acquired&#13;to enable the Company to position itself as the leading provider of testing solutions for CBD products for both compliance requirements&#13;and consumer safety as these products continue to increase in popularity. Immediately following the purchase
 the Company holds&#13;51% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Trace Analytics. The Common Stock Purchase Agreement included the&#13;option for Trace to repurchase 205
410 shares of Common Stock based on the occurrence of certain Repurchase Triggering Events.&#13;Based on a review of the Repurchase Triggering Events
 it is considered unlikely that any of the events will occur. Additionally

 as set forth below
 are considered provisional and subject to adjustment as additional&#13;information is obtained through the purchase price measurement period (a period of up to one year from the closing date). The&#13;provisional allocation of the purchase price is based on management&amp;#8217;s preliminary estimates. Once management completes its&#13;analysis to finalize the purchase price allocation

 the Company determined that&#13;any customer lists or business licenses held by Trace Analytics are immaterial in relation to the overall value of Trace; additionally
&#13;Trace Analytics does not hold any patents or proprietary technology
 and does not have long-term contractual arrangements with&#13;customers. As such
 there are no separately identifiable intangible assets meeting the criteria of ASC 805. Concurrently
 the&#13;Company preliminarily allocated the $1

 the Company recognized its revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605 &lt;i&gt;Revenue&#13;Recognition&lt;/i&gt; 

 2018 the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board&amp;#8217;s (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) Accounting Standards Update&#13;(&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2014-09
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&lt;/i&gt; (Topic 606) (&amp;#8220;ASC 606&amp;#8221;) which superseded&#13;previous revenue recognition guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods&#13;or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise&#13;judgment when considering the terms of contracts
 which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer
&#13;(2) identifying the Company&amp;#8217;s performance obligations in the contract or agreement
 (3) determining the transaction price
&#13;(4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations

 net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance&#13;for doubtful accounts is based on the Company&amp;#8217;s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews&#13;the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice and the collection history&#13;of each customer to determine whether a specific allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged&#13;against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified. As of March 31
 2018
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2
227.&#13;The Company did not deem it necessary to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31


 three years&#13;for other office equipment and computer hardware

 there were no indicators of impairment of the Company&amp;#8217;s property and equipment and&#13;other long-lived assets as of March 31

    

 2018
 the Company used either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company used the equity method&#13;for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company was considered to have significant influence over the operations of&#13;the investee. The Company used the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost&#13;basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary

 2018
 the Company adopted ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &amp;#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial&#13;Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value&#13;option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires&#13;certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As such


&#13;the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows&#13;associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
&#13;if any

 2017
 the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &amp;#8220;Agreement&amp;#8221;) with mCig
 Inc. for the purchase&#13;of the VitaCBD brand name. In connection with the Agreement
 the Company recorded intangible assets of $1
138
135. During the&#13;fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet management&amp;#8217;s expectations and the Company was&#13;not able to achieve the expected operating results. As a result
 the Company impaired the intangible asset related to the acquisition&#13;of the&amp;#160;VitaCBD brand name&amp;#160;and recorded an impairment charge of $893


 2019
 the Company recorded goodwill of $1
941
149 related&#13;to the purchase of Trace Analytics (see Note5). The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events&#13;and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its annual impairment&#13;analysis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing&#13;the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s carrying amount
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the reporting unit. Estimations and assumptions&#13;regarding the number of reporting units
 future performances
 results of the Company&amp;#8217;s operations and comparability of its&#13;market capitalization and net book value will be used. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 goodwill&#13;is considered impaired and an impairment loss is measured by the resulting amount. Because the Company has one reporting unit
&#13;as part of the Company&amp;#8217;s qualitative assessment an entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment is utilized. No&#13;impairment losses have been recorded in the fiscal years ended March 31


 for&#13;services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for share-based payments under the guidance as set forth in the Share-Based&#13;Payment Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&amp;#8220;ASC&amp;#8221;)
 which requires the measurement and recognition&#13;of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees
 officers
 directors
 and consultants
 including&#13;employee stock options
 based on estimated fair values. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards to&#13;employees and directors on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
 and the value of the portion of&#13;the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the required service period in the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;statements of operations. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance&#13;with the authoritative guidance whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at&#13;either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) the date at which the necessary performance to earn the&#13;equity instruments is complete. Stock-based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated&#13;forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised
 as necessary




 the Company&amp;#8217;s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer
 who reviews&#13;operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance
&#13;which is based on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information&#13;quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which&#13;the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &amp;#8220;Segment&#13;Reporting&amp;#8221; due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services;&#13;and procurement
 manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment


 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02
 &lt;i&gt;Leases&lt;/i&gt;
&#13;which was subsequently amended in 2018 by ASU 2018-10
 ASU 2018-11 and ASU 2018-20 (collectively
 Topic 842). Topic 842 will require&#13;the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease&#13;payments
 for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over&#13;the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.&#13;For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset&#13;in the statement of comprehensive income and the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified&#13;as a financing activity while the interest component will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.&#13;Topic 842 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted.&#13;Upon adoption
 leases will be recognized and measured at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective&#13;approach. Topic 842 allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period the new lease standard is adopted and will not require&#13;restatement of prior periods. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of Topic 842 on the Company&amp;#8217;s financial&#13;statements and disclosures

 the FASB issued ASU 2017-11
 &lt;i&gt;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Accounting&#13;for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features.&lt;/i&gt; ASU 2017-11 allows companies to exclude a down round feature when&#13;determining whether a financial instrument (or embedded conversion feature) is considered indexed to the entity&amp;#8217;s own stock.&#13;As a result
 financial instruments (or embedded conversion features) with down round features may no longer be required to be&#13;accounted for as derivative liabilities. A company will recognize the value of a down round feature only when it is triggered&#13;and the strike price has been adjusted downward. For equity-classified freestanding financial instruments
 an entity will treat&#13;the value of the effect of the down round as a dividend and a reduction of income available to common shareholders in computing&#13;basic earnings per share. For convertible instruments with embedded conversion features containing down round provisions
 entities&#13;will recognize the value of the down round as a beneficial conversion discount to be amortized to earnings. The guidance in ASU&#13;2017-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early&#13;adoption is permitted
 and the guidance is to be applied using a full or modified retrospective approach. The Company plans to&#13;adopt ASU 2017-11 on April 1

 based on their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the&#13;estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Identifiable assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and&#13;any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally
&#13;contingent consideration
 if any. is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. Goodwill is&#13;recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling&#13;interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired

Description
of the Company

Applied
BioSciences Corp. (formerly First Fixtures
 Inc. and Stony Hill Corp. or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State
of Nevada on February 21
 2014 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. The Company is a vertically integrated company focused
on the development of science-driven cannabinoid therapeutics / biopharmaceuticals
 and delivering high-quality CBD products as
well as state-of-the-art testing and analytics capabilities.

Effective
October 24
 2016 the Company changed its name from First Fixtures Inc. to Stony Hill Corp and on March 6
 2018
 the Company changed
its name from Stony Hill Corp. to Applied BioSciences Corp.

In
January 2019
 the Company closed on a purchase of 520
410 shares of common stock of Trace Analytics
 Inc.
 a Washington corporation
(&#8220;Trace Analytics&#8221;)
 for an aggregate purchase price of $1
250
000
 of which $750
000 was paid in cash and $500
000
was paid in shares of common stock of the Company. Trace Analytics is a cannabis testing laboratory. Immediately following the
purchase
 the Company holds 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Trace Analytics.

Going
concern

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize
its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the consolidated
financial statements
 during the year ended March 31
 2019 the Company incurred a net loss of $2
679
022 and used $905
051 of
cash in operating activities
 and had a working capital deficiency of $19
807 as of March 31
 2019. These and other factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements
are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

The Company&#8217;s ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues
and income from operations. During the fiscal period ended March 31
 2019
 the Company sold 37
500 shares of its common stock
to accredited investors at a price of $2.00 per share for total proceeds of $75
000 and issued convertible notes for total proceeds
of approximately $1
600
000 both in private placements to accredited investors. However
 the Company will need and is currently
working on obtaining additional funds to operate its business through and beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing. There is no
assurance that such funds will be available or at terms acceptable to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional
financing
 it may contain undue restrictions and covenants on its operations
 in the case of debt financing or cause substantial
dilution for its stockholders in the case of convertible debt and equity financing.

 descriptions of the basis of presentation

 significant accounting policies
 consolidations
 reclassifications

 a Nevada limited liability company. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Management evaluates its investments on an individual basis for purposes of determining whether or not consolidation is appropriate.




consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Among other things
management estimates include the collectability of its accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 estimates of fair value
of equity investments
 assumptions made in determining purchase price allocation
 impairment of investments and intangible assets
accruals for potential liabilities
 and realization of deferred tax assets. These estimates generally involve complex issues and
require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information and the prediction of future trends
 and are subject to change from
period to period. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.




paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#8221;) to measure the fair
value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about
fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes
a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.
The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

    
    
    



are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.


gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described
above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.


of the Company&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities
 such as accounts receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair
values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its investments.

 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

revenue is principally derived from its subsidiaries
 Applied Products LLC
 and Trace Analytics.



    
    
Applied Products LLC revenues are generated from sales of high-quality CBD products for consumer and pet health and wellness. Sales of these products were made to individual distributors and through online channels. Revenue from the sale of these products was $543
970 and $197
554 during the years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively

    
    
    

    
    
Trace Analytics generates revenue from services by offering state-of-the-art testing and analytics capabilities to CBD and hemp companies. Sales of these services are to marijuana producers and processors
 dispensaries
 and CBD and hemp companies. Revenue from the sale of these&#160;services was $163
092 during the years ended March 31
 2019. There were no such sales during the previous period.



2018
 the Company recognized its revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605 

 upon the delivery of its services or products when: (1) delivery had occurred or services rendered; (2) persuasive evidence of
an arrangement existed; (3) there are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related accounts receivable
was probable.


1
 2018 the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;)
No. 2014-09
 (Topic 606) (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;) which superseded previous revenue
recognition guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to
customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment
when considering the terms of contracts
 which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer
 (2) identifying
the Company&#8217;s performance obligations in the contract or agreement
 (3) determining the transaction price
 (4) allocating
the transaction price to the separate performance obligations
 and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it
is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients. The Company has concluded that the new guidance did not
require any significant change to its revenue recognition processes and the implementation of ASC 606 did not have a material impact
on the Company&#8217;s financial statements.




amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping as revenue. The costs incurred by the Company for shipping
are classified as cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.




advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2019 and 2018 amounted to $541
873 and
$160
295
 respectively
 and were included in &#34;Sales and marketing expenses&#34; in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.




stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on a first-in-first-out average cost basis. Inventories consist
of finished goods held for sale. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand and records an inventory provision for
excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference
between the cost of the inventory and market value
 based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to
assess. There was no provision for inventory obsolescence necessary as of March 31
 2019 and 2018.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts


are recorded at the invoiced amount
 net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the
Company&#8217;s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful
accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice and the collection history of each customer to determine whether a
specific allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts
when identified. As of March 31
 2018
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2
227. The Company did not deem it necessary to
provide an allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31
 2019.




are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
Company uses an estimated useful life of three years for employee-related computers and software
 three years for other office
equipment and computer hardware
 and five years for machinery and furniture. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter
of the lease-term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.


reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently
if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Based upon management&#8217;s
annual assessment
 there were no indicators of impairment of the Company&#8217;s property and equipment and other long-lived assets
as of March 31
 2019.




(loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#8217;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares during the period. Shares of common stock to be issued are included in weighted average shares
calculation from the date of grant. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#8217;s net income
(loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted
weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted average number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive
debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items.




2018
 the Company used either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company used the equity method for unconsolidated
equity investments in which the Company was considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. The Company
used the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an
other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
 the Company
writes down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable value.


 2018
the Company adopted ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation
and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires certain equity investments
to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As such
 the Company measures its equity investments
at their fair value at end of each reporting period.

Consolidated Balance Sheets.




are recorded when such assets are acquired and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. The Company
regularly reviews intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed from the
original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist
 the
Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated
with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
 if
any
 are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment
determination was made.


2017
 the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with mCig
 Inc. for the purchase of the
VitaCBD brand name. In connection with the Agreement
 the Company recorded intangible assets of $1
138
135. During the fiscal year
ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet management&#8217;s expectations and the Company was not able to
achieve the expected operating results. As a result
 the Company impaired the intangible asset related to the acquisition of the&#160;VitaCBD
brand name&#160;and recorded an impairment charge of $893
667.




the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in
a business combination. During the year ended March 31
 2019
 the Company recorded goodwill of $1
941
149 related to the purchase
of Trace Analytics (see Note5). The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events and changes
in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its annual impairment analysis in
the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting
unit&#8217;s carrying amount
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the reporting unit. Estimations and assumptions regarding
the number of reporting units
 future performances
 results of the Company&#8217;s operations and comparability of its market capitalization
and net book value will be used. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 goodwill is considered impaired
and an impairment loss is measured by the resulting amount. Because the Company has one reporting unit
 as part of the Company&#8217;s
qualitative assessment an entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment is utilized. No impairment losses have been recorded
in the fiscal years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018.




issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions
 for services and for financing
costs. The Company accounts for share-based payments under the guidance as set forth in the Share-Based Payment Topic of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;)
 which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for
all share-based payment awards made to employees
 officers
 directors
 and consultants
 including employee stock options
 based
on estimated fair values. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards to employees and directors on the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
 and the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected
to vest is recognized as expense over the required service period in the Company&#8217;s statements of operations. The Company
accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance
whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance
commitment is reached
 or b) the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Stock-based
compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated
at the time of grant and revised
 as necessary
 in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.



accounts for its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting where the cost is allocated to the underlying net
tangible and intangible assets acquired
 based on their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Identifiable assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally
 contingent consideration
if any. is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by
which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired
 net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value
of assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests requires management&#8217;s judgment and often involves the
use of significant estimates and assumptions.




the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.




in one segment for the distribution of products and services. In accordance with the &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; Topic of the
ASC
 the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer
 who reviews operating
results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance
 which
is based on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly
and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which the entity
holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221;
due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement
manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment
 all financial information required by &#8220;Segment
Reporting&#8221; can be found in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02
 
 which was
subsequently amended in 2018 by ASU 2018-10
 ASU 2018-11 and ASU 2018-20 (collectively
 Topic 842). Topic 842 will require the
recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease
term on a straight-line basis
 with all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance
leases
 interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement
of comprehensive income and the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity
while the interest component will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. Topic 842 is effective for
annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption
 leases will
be recognized and measured at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Topic 842
allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period the new lease standard is adopted and will not require restatement of prior
periods. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of Topic 842 on the Company&#8217;s financial statements and disclosures
though the adoption is expected to result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities reflected on the Company&#8217;s
balance sheets.


 the
FASB issued ASU 2017-11

Instruments with Down Round Features.
a financial instrument (or embedded conversion feature) is considered indexed to the entity&#8217;s own stock. As a result
 financial
instruments (or embedded conversion features) with down round features may no longer be required to be accounted for as derivative
liabilities. A company will recognize the value of a down round feature only when it is triggered and the strike price has been
adjusted downward. For equity-classified freestanding financial instruments
 an entity will treat the value of the effect of the
down round as a dividend and a reduction of income available to common shareholders in computing basic earnings per share. For
convertible instruments with embedded conversion features containing down round provisions
 entities will recognize the value of
the down round as a beneficial conversion discount to be amortized to earnings. The guidance in ASU 2017-11 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
 and the guidance
is to be applied using a full or modified retrospective approach. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2017-11 on April 1
 2019. The
adoption of ASU 2017-11 is not expected to have an impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements and related disclosures because
the conversion feature of the Company&#8217;s warrants have features other than down round provisions that require the current
accounting treatment and classification.

Cannabi subsequently changed its name to GemmaCert. In October 2017
 the Company purchased an additional 7
309 shares of Preferred
A-1 stock of GemmaCert at a price of $2.536 per share for total investment of $18
537. At March 31
 2019
 the Company revalued
all its shares of GemmaCert at $2.536 per share
 the most recent purchase price. This resulted in an aggregate increase in value
of $24
992
 which was reflected as unrealized gain from the change in GemmaCert&#8217;s market value.

As
a private company
 GemmaCert does not have a readily determinable fair value. Additionally
 there have been no observable price
changes from transactions for similar investments in GemmaCert during the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019. As such
 the Company
has measured the value of the investment at cost as of March 31
 2019
 which we believe approximates market value.

(B)
In January 2017
 the Company entered in to an agreement to purchase 59
524 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $4.20
per share for total investment of $250
000
 which accounts for less than 5% investment in Hightimes Holdings Corp. (&#8220;Hightimes&#8221;).
Hightimes owns High Times Magazine and hosts festivals
 events and competitions including the High Times Cannabis Cup and multiple
e-commerce properties
 including HighTimes.com
 CannabisCup.com and 420.com. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 the
Company was able to obtain observable evidence that the investment had a market value of $11.00 per share
 or an aggregate value
of $654
763. As such
 the Company recorded an unrealized gain from the change in market value of $404
763 during the fiscal year
ended March 31
 2019.

(C)
In June 2017
 the Company entered in a Subscription Agreement to purchase 0.5% interest in Precision Cultivation Systems
 LLC
(&#8220;Precision&#8221;)
 a Delaware limited liability company
 for a purchase price of $50
000. Precision is developing a growth
system that capitalizes on a patent-pending cultivation method that utilizes proprietary irrigation and root zone conditioning.
As part of the Subscription Agreement
 $42
500 of the investment is subject to repayment on a pro-rata basis with other investors
who have entered into similar Subscription Agreements. Amounts subject to repayment are solely at the discretion of Precision.

As
a private company
 Precision does not have a readily determinable fair value. Additionally
 there have been no observable price
changes from transactions for similar investments in Precision during the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019. As such
 the Company
has measured the value of the investment at cost as of March 31
 2019
 which we believe approximates market value.

(D)
In January 2018
 the Company paid $100
000 for the purchase of a Membership Interest in Bailey Venture Partners XII LLC (&#8220;Bailey&#8221;)
representing less than 5% interest in Bailey. Along with other funds received from third-party investors
 Bailey plans to invest
funds received in various strategic investments. In February 2019
 the Company received a distribution of $186
397 from Bailey&#8217;s
investment in JUUL Labs
 Inc.

As
a private company
 Bailey does not have a readily determinable fair value. Additionally
 there have been no observable price changes
from transactions for similar investments in Bailey during the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019. As such
 the Company has measured
the value of the investment at cost as of March 31
 2019
 which we believe approximates market value.

As
the Company does not participate in the management of these companies nor has the ability to exercise significant influence over
these companies
 the Company recorded these investments at cost
 and as of April 1
 2018
 adjusted the cost basis to market at
the end of each reporting period. Dividends
 if any
 are recognized when received.

ACQUISITION OF TRACE ANALYTICS
 INC.


Mar. 31
 2019






NOTE 5 - ACQUISITION OF TRACE ANALYTICS
 INC

On
January 7
 2019
 the Company closed on a purchase of 520
410 shares of common stock of Trace Analytics
 Inc.
 a Washington corporation
(&#8220;Trace Analytics&#8221;). Pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
 the Company purchased Trace Analytics at a purchase
price of $2.40 per share
 for an aggregate purchase price of $1
250
000
 of which $750
000 was paid in cash and $500
000 was paid
through the issuance of shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Trace Analytics is a cannabis testing laboratory acquired
to enable the Company to position itself as the leading provider of testing solutions for CBD products for both compliance requirements
and consumer safety as these products continue to increase in popularity. Immediately following the purchase
 the Company holds
51% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Trace Analytics. The Common Stock Purchase Agreement included the
option for Trace to repurchase 205
410 shares of Common Stock based on the occurrence of certain Repurchase Triggering Events.
Based on a review of the Repurchase Triggering Events
 it is considered unlikely that any of the events will occur. Additionally
the Company entered into a Voting Agreement with Trace concurrent with the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. The Voting Agreement
provided for the designation of three out of five positions on the Trace Analytics Board of Directors by the Company. The Voting
Agreement also detailed certain transactions that require two-thirds approval by the Board of Directors. The Voting Agreement
is not considered to impact the ability of the Company to control the operations and assets of Trace Analytics.

The
Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805 &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221;.
The Company is in the process of performing an allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed. The fair values of the assets acquired
 as set forth below
 are considered provisional and subject to adjustment as additional
information is obtained through the purchase price measurement period (a period of up to one year from the closing date). The
provisional allocation of the purchase price is based on management&#8217;s preliminary estimates. Once management completes its
analysis to finalize the purchase price allocation
 it is reasonably possible that there could be changes to the preliminary values.
The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.

The
following table summarizes the provisional amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:

Based
on management&#8217;s analysis of the acquisition transaction pursuant to the provisions of ASC 805
 the Company determined that
any customer lists or business licenses held by Trace Analytics are immaterial in relation to the overall value of Trace; additionally
Trace Analytics does not hold any patents or proprietary technology
 and does not have long-term contractual arrangements with
customers. As such
 there are no separately identifiable intangible assets meeting the criteria of ASC 805. Concurrently
 the
Company preliminarily allocated the $1
941
149 excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets of $509
831 to goodwill.
&#160;

The
following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined results of operations as if the business combination with Trace
Analytics had been completed on April 1
 2017
 the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. These unaudited
pro forma results are presented for informational purpose only and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of
operations of the combined company would have been if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period presented
 nor
are they indicative of future results of operations:

Mar. 31
 2019








During
the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019
 the Company issued separate Convertible Promissory Notes (&#8220;Notes&#8221;) having a
total principal amount of $1
529
455 to certain accredited holders. Interest ranged from 1% to 8% per month
 and the note holders
at their sole discretion and election
 were allowed to convert any part or all of the then outstanding principal and/or interest
on these Notes into shares of common stock of the Company at a fixed price per share of $1.00. As of March 31
 2019
 all holders
of the Notes converted the principal portion of their Notes to 1
529
455 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock and accrued
interest of $75
501
 of which 54
995 shares with fair value of $54
995 had not been issued as of March 31
 2019 and were reflected
in &#8220;Common stock to be issued&#8221; in the consolidated statement of stockholders&#8217; equity.

A
portion of the Notes were issued when the market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock was in excess of the $1.00 per share
conversion price creating a beneficial conversion feature associated with these Notes with an aggregate amount of $500
274 upon
issuance dates. As such
 the Company recorded $500
274 in additional paid-in capital and debt discount representing the intrinsic
value of the beneficial conversion feature at the date of the borrowing against the Notes. The value of the beneficial conversion
feature was fully amortized as interest expense upon conversion of all of the outstanding Notes and reflected as interest expense
for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019.

The
Company has no tax provision for any period presented due to its history of operating losses. As of March 31
 2019
 the Company
had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $4.6 million that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income
through 2039. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements
as management has determined that their realization of the Company&#8217;s net deferred tax assets of approximately $1
312
000
was not likely to occur and accordingly
 the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating
to tax loss carry-forward.

The
Company adopted accounting rules which address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on
a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under these rules
 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. These accounting rules also provide guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. As of March 31
 2019
 no liability for unrealized tax benefits
was required to be recorded.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries
 Applied Products LLC
VitaCBD LLC
 an 80% owned entity
 Trace Analytics
 Inc.
 a 51% owned entity
 all Washington limited liability companies
 and SHL
Management LLC
 a 100% owned entity
 a Nevada limited liability company. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation. Management evaluates its investments on an individual basis for purposes of determining whether or not consolidation
is appropriate.




Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. Among other things
 management estimates include the collectability of its accounts receivable
 recoverability
of inventory
 estimates of fair value of equity investments
 assumptions made in determining purchase price allocation
 impairment
of investments and intangible assets
 accruals for potential liabilities
 and realization of deferred tax assets. These estimates
generally involve complex issues and require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information and the prediction of future
trends
 and are subject to change from period to period. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.





The
Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#8221;) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:



Level
    1
    
Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    2
    
Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    3
    
Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.


Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.

The
carrying amounts of the Company&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities
 such as accounts receivables and accounts payable approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its investments.

The
changes in carrying amounts of the equity investments the years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

The
Company&#8217;s revenue is principally derived from its subsidiaries
 Applied Products LLC
 and Trace Analytics.



    
    
Applied
    Products LLC revenues are generated from sales of high-quality CBD products for consumer and pet health and wellness. Sales
    of these products were made to individual distributors and through online channels. Revenue from the sale of these products
    was $543
970 and $197
554 during the years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively

    
    
    

    
    
Trace
    Analytics generates revenue from services by offering state-of-the-art testing and analytics capabilities to CBD and hemp
    companies. Sales of these services are to marijuana producers and processors
 dispensaries
 and CBD and hemp companies. Revenue
    from the sale of these&#160;services was $163
092 during the years ended March 31
 2019. There were no such sales during the
    previous period.


Prior
to April 1
 2018

Recognition
 upon the delivery of its services or products when: (1) delivery had occurred or services rendered; (2) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement existed; (3) there are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related
accounts receivable was probable.

Effective
April 1
 2018 the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Update
(&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-09
 (Topic 606) (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;) which superseded
previous revenue recognition guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods
or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise
judgment when considering the terms of contracts
 which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer
(2) identifying the Company&#8217;s performance obligations in the contract or agreement
 (3) determining the transaction price
(4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations
 and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect
the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients. The Company has concluded that the
new guidance did not require any significant change to its revenue recognition processes and the implementation of ASC 606 did
not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements.




The Company recognizes amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping as revenue.
The costs incurred by the Company for shipping are classified as cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.





The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2019 and 2018 amounted
to $541
873 and $160
295
 respectively
 and were included in &#34;Sales and marketing expenses&#34; in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.




Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on a first-in-first-out average cost basis. Inventories
consist of finished goods held for sale. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand and records an inventory provision
for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the
difference between the cost of the inventory and market value
 based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently
difficult to assess. There was no provision for inventory obsolescence necessary as of March 31
 2019 and 2018.




Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
 net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance
for doubtful accounts is based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice and the collection history
of each customer to determine whether a specific allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged
against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified. As of March 31
 2018
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2
227.
The Company did not deem it necessary to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31
 2019.





Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. The Company uses an estimated useful life of three years for employee-related computers and software
 three years
for other office equipment and computer hardware
 and five years for machinery and furniture. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of the lease-term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Management
regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Based upon
management&#8217;s annual assessment
 there were no indicators of impairment of the Company&#8217;s property and equipment and
other long-lived assets as of March 31
 2019.





The basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#8217;s net income (loss) available
to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Shares of common stock to be issued are
included in weighted average shares calculation from the date of grant. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by
dividing the Company&#8217;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted average number of
shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss)
per share due to the lack of dilutive items.





Through
March 31
 2018
 the Company used either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company used the equity method
for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company was considered to have significant influence over the operations of
the investee. The Company used the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost
basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
the Company writes down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable value.

On
April 1
 2018
 the Company adopted ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value
option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires
certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As such
 the Company
measures its equity investments at their fair value at end of each reporting period.

Investments&#160;accounted
for under the equity method or cost method of accounting above are included in the caption &#34;Equity investments&#34; on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.






Intangible
assets are recorded when such assets are acquired and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. The
Company regularly reviews intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed
from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist
the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows
associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
if any
 are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the
impairment determination was made.

On
February 23
 2017
 the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with mCig
 Inc. for the purchase
of the VitaCBD brand name. In connection with the Agreement
 the Company recorded intangible assets of $1
138
135. During the
fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet management&#8217;s expectations and the Company was
not able to achieve the expected operating results. As a result
 the Company impaired the intangible asset related to the acquisition
of the&#160;VitaCBD brand name&#160;and recorded an impairment charge of $893
667.





Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired in a business combination. During the year ended March 31
 2019
 the Company recorded goodwill of $1
941
149 related
to the purchase of Trace Analytics (see Note5). The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events
and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its annual impairment
analysis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing
the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the reporting unit. Estimations and assumptions
regarding the number of reporting units
 future performances
 results of the Company&#8217;s operations and comparability of its
market capitalization and net book value will be used. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 goodwill
is considered impaired and an impairment loss is measured by the resulting amount. Because the Company has one reporting unit
as part of the Company&#8217;s qualitative assessment an entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment is utilized. No
impairment losses have been recorded in the fiscal years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018.





The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions
 for
services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for share-based payments under the guidance as set forth in the Share-Based
Payment Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;)
 which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees
 officers
 directors
 and consultants
 including
employee stock options
 based on estimated fair values. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards to
employees and directors on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
 and the value of the portion of
the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the required service period in the Company&#8217;s
statements of operations. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance
with the authoritative guidance whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at
either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) the date at which the necessary performance to earn the
equity instruments is complete. Stock-based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated
forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised
 as necessary
 in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates.




&#160;The
Company accounts for its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting where the cost is allocated to the underlying
net tangible and intangible assets acquired
 based on their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Identifiable assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and
any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally
contingent consideration
 if any. is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. Goodwill is
recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired
 net of assumed liabilities. Determining
the fair value of assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests requires management&#8217;s judgment and often
involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.




The
Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.




The
Company operates in one segment for the distribution of products and services. In accordance with the &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221;
Topic of the ASC
 the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer
 who reviews
operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance
which is based on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information
quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which
the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &#8220;Segment
Reporting&#8221; due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services;
and procurement
 manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment
 all financial information
required by &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; can be found in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.




. For the
fiscal year ended March 31

 and 10% of revenue were generated from our three largest customers.

.
At March 31

On
March 31
 2019
 accounts payable to the Company&#8217;s largest vendor represented 52%.&#160; There was no vendor that represented
10% or more of the Company&#8217;s accounts payable balance on March 31
 2018.





In
February 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02
 
which was subsequently amended in 2018 by ASU 2018-10
 ASU 2018-11 and ASU 2018-20 (collectively
 Topic 842). Topic 842 will require
the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease
payments
 for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over
the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.
For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset
in the statement of comprehensive income and the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified
as a financing activity while the interest component will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.
Topic 842 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
Upon adoption
 leases will be recognized and measured at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
approach. Topic 842 allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period the new lease standard is adopted and will not require
restatement of prior periods. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of Topic 842 on the Company&#8217;s financial
statements and disclosures
 though the adoption is expected to result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities reflected
on the Company&#8217;s balance sheets.

In
July 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-11

for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features.
determining whether a financial instrument (or embedded conversion feature) is considered indexed to the entity&#8217;s own stock.
As a result
 financial instruments (or embedded conversion features) with down round features may no longer be required to be
accounted for as derivative liabilities. A company will recognize the value of a down round feature only when it is triggered
and the strike price has been adjusted downward. For equity-classified freestanding financial instruments
 an entity will treat
the value of the effect of the down round as a dividend and a reduction of income available to common shareholders in computing
basic earnings per share. For convertible instruments with embedded conversion features containing down round provisions
 entities
will recognize the value of the down round as a beneficial conversion discount to be amortized to earnings. The guidance in ASU
2017-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption is permitted
 and the guidance is to be applied using a full or modified retrospective approach. The Company plans to
adopt ASU 2017-11 on April 1
 2019. The adoption of ASU 2017-11 is not expected to have an impact on the Company&#8217;s financial
statements and related disclosures because the conversion feature of the Company&#8217;s warrants have features other than down
round provisions that require the current accounting treatment and classification.

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB
 including its Emerging Issues Task Force
 the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants
 and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company&#8217;s present or future financial statements.&#160;
