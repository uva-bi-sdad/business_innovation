Iced Tea&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; are trademarks of ours. We do not currently have a federal

 we are pursuing such registration and intend to seek registration in other

Tea&rdquo; on August 28
 2012 and subsequently for the registration of the trademark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; on July
23
 2013. Both applications encountered resistance to registration as a result of the existence of the mark &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo;
for &ldquo;iced tea.&rdquo; We determined that the mark &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo; for &ldquo;iced tea&rdquo; was abandoned. As
a result we filed a petition to cancel the registration on this ground. In January 2015
 the petition was granted and the mark
was cancelled. Our application for the mark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; is now pending on the supplemental registry.


 we have filed trademark
applications for &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; as a standard character mark and as a stylized mark
 which are pending
review by the USPTO. In each case
 the application is for use of the trademark with iced tea
 tea based products
 juices
 water
beverages and other similar products. &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; standard character trademark has been in use

our marks in federal court

 however
 that the USPTO will approve these applications.
For example
 even though we have been successful in our cancellation petition with respect to the &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo; mark
as described above
 we still may not be able to obtain registered ownership of the mark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; if
the USPTO determines that the mark is generic or deceptively misdescriptive (due to the connotation that the beverages contain
alcohol). The USPTO raised concerns over these two issues in the applications for &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; and &ldquo;Long
Island Brand Iced Tea&rdquo; marks. Similar issues
 or other issues
 also may arise in connection with the other marks for which
we are seeking or plan to seek registration. With respect to the pending trademark applications for &ldquo;The Original Long Island
Brand&rdquo; (standard character mark and stylized mark)
 the USPTO has made an initial determination that both marks are geographically
descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded the company the opportunity to produce evidence to establish
that the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce.

Current global economic conditions may adversely affect
our industry
 business and result of operations.


in the past several years have included diminished liquidity and credit availability
 a decline in consumer confidence
 a decline
in economic growth
 an increased unemployment rate and uncertainty about economic stability. While certain of these negative trends
have reversed in recent years
 there can be no assurance that there will not be renewed deterioration in credit and financial markets
and confidence in economic conditions. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways
 making
it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Any adverse global economic conditions and tightening
of credit in financial markets may lead consumers to postpone spending
 which may cause our customers to cancel
 decrease or delay
their existing and future orders with us. In addition
 financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers
 manufacturers
 distributors
or customers could result in product delays
 increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. We are unable to
predict the likely duration and severity of disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions.

We depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant
portion of our sales.


Consolidation has resulted in large
 sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist
our price increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger
 more tailored promotional
and product delivery programs. If we
 and our bottlers and distributors
 do not successfully provide appropriate marketing
 product
packaging
 pricing and service to these retailers
 our product availability
 sales and margins could suffer. Certain retailers
that we service primarily through our distributors make up a significant percentage of our products&rsquo; retail volume
 including
volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. We also sell directly to certain retail accounts
 including Costco
 and to the distribution
facilities of such retailers. During the year ended December 31
 2015
 sales to Wakefern Food Corp. represented approximately 10%
of our net sales. While sales to Costco diminished in 2015
 sales to Costco made up a substantial portion of our sales during 2014.
During the year ended December 31
 2015
 sales to Costco represented approximately 6% of our sales
 while such sales represented
32% of our sales during the year ended December 31
 2014. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete
with some of our brands. The loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our
business and financial performance.

 we do not currently have
registered ownership of the trademark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; as
described below and elsewhere herein. We and third parties
 including competitors
 could come into conflict over intellectual
property rights. Litigation could disrupt our business
 divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect
our rights or defend ourselves against claims. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be
sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. Our business is also highly dependent upon our

 2012. We filed for the trademark of &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; on July 23
 2013. Both applications
encountered resistance to registration as a result of the existence of the mark &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo; for &ldquo;iced tea.&rdquo;
We determined that the mark &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo; for &ldquo;iced tea&rdquo; had been abandoned and filed a petition to cancel
the registration of this mark with the USPTO. In January 2015
 this petition was granted and the mark for &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo;
for &ldquo;iced tea&rdquo; was cancelled. Accordingly
 we intend to petition for the mark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; to
be placed on the supplemental registry. If this second petition is successful
 we will be able to use the &ldquo;&reg;&rdquo; symbol
to notify others that its mark is federally registered and may sue for infringement of its mark in federal court. Upon completion
of this second petition
 we plan to file for placement on the primary register. However
 even though the cancellation petition was successful
we still may not be able to obtain registered ownership of the mark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; if the USPTO determines
that the mark is generic or misdescriptive (due to the connotation that the beverages contain alcohol). The USPTO raised concerns
over these two issues in the initial applications.


 we have filed trademark applications for
&ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; as a standard character mark and as a stylized mark
 which applications are
pending review by the USPTO. The applications are for use of the trademarks with iced tea
 tea based products
 juices
 water
beverages and other similar products. LIBB also plans to file for stylized marks protecting certain other tag lines and
product designs. With respect to the pending trademark applications for &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo;
(standard character mark and stylized mark)
 the USPTO has made an initial determination that both marks are geographically
descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded the company the opportunity to produce evidence to
establish that the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce. There can be no assurance that the USPTO will
approve these applications.



    
    



Our substantial debt could adversely affect our liquidity

 which bears interest at the
prime rate plus 7.5%). In addition
 in March 2016
 the Lenders approved an increase of $500

Credit Agreement and approved advances under the Credit Agreement in the same amount
 of which $250
000 will be advanced no later
than March 24
 2016 and the remaining $250
000 will be advanced no later than April 22
 2016. Although we may pay interest that
accrues on the loans under the Credit Agreement by capitalizing the interest and adding it to the principal balance of such loans
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt in future years. If new debt is added to our current debt levels
the related risks for us could intensify.

 if we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants

 there could be a default under the terms of such agreements.
In such event
 or if we are otherwise in default under the Credit Agreement or such other agreements
 including pursuant to the
cross-default provisions of such agreements
 the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and
declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Furthermore
 our lenders under the Credit Agreement could foreclose on their security
interests in our assets
 including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries. If any of those events occur
 our assets
might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing.
Even if we could obtain alternative financing
 it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally
we may not be able to amend the Financing Agreement or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial
costs. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial
position.

The loss of the services of our key personnel could negatively
affect our business
 as could our inability to attract and retain qualified management

needed.

 including Philip Thomas (co-founder of LIBB and our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer) and Peter Dydensborg (our Chief Operating Officer). As we have a limited operating history
 we are highly dependent upon
their knowledge

discontinue their employment with us. If so
 we may not be able to find adequate replacements for them. Without their experience
expertise and reputation
 our development efforts and future prospects would be substantially impaired. We have employment agreements
in place with these individuals that include non-competition provisions.

We may not comply with applicable government laws and
regulations

 state and local laws
and regulations in the U.S.
 and other countries in which we do business. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our
business including the manufacture

 labeling
 transportation
 advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these
laws or regulations could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition
 any
significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation
 or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent
laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For example
 changes in recycling and bottle
deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health

marketing of food products is increasing. Certain state warning and labeling laws
 such as California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prop 65
&rdquo;
which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects
 could
become applicable to our products. Some local and regional governments and school boards have enacted
 or have proposed to enact
regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in schools. Any violations or changes of regulations could have
a material adverse effect on our profitability
 or disrupt the production or distribution of our products

 we cannot assure you that adequate capital
will be available to finance our current growth plans

any of which could harm our business.




losses. There is no guarantee that we will become a profitable business. Further
 our future operating results depend upon a number
of factors
 including our ability to manage our growth
 retain our customer base and to successfully identify and respond to emerging
trends in our market areas.

While we currently produce only non-alcoholic beverages
we are exploring entry into the alcoholic beverage industry. To the extent that we expand our operations into new sectors of the
beverage industry
 our business operations may suffer from a lack of experience
 significant costs of entry and the competitive
conditions in the market
 among other factors
 which could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition
 results
of operations and cash flows.


As we principally have been engaged in the production of NARTD teas
 we have limited experience with developing
 producing
 marketing
and distributing alcoholic beverages. Additionally
 we will be exposed to significant operating costs associated with developing
new products and entering a new sector of the beverage industry and will face new regulatory burdens
 which could have an adverse
impact on our business as well as place us at a disadvantage relative to more established alcoholic beverage market participants.
Furthermore
 the alcoholic beverage industry is highly competitive. We will compete with multinational corporations with significant
financial resources. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes
in consumer preferences by introducing new products
 reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. In addition:


We may not be able to adequately distinguish our alcohol products from our non-alcohol products. Our inability to create the
proper differentiation could result in customer confusion and could have adverse regulatory consequences.


We may not be able establish the proper infrastructure to support the supply chain from the manufacturing of the product to
the ultimate purchase by the end consumer.


Our current management team lacks significant experience in the alcoholic beverage industry. We may be unable to attract and
retain the necessary talent at the executive officer and board levels to execute our strategies in the alcoholic beverage industry.


Our product designs and formulas are subject to federal and state regulations. As a result
 we may incur substantial product
development costs on products that are not approved for sale.


 we may be unsuccessful
in expanding our business to include alcoholic beverages. Furthermore
 attempting such an expansion will require a substantial
investment of resources and management time
 which could materially adversely affect our more established non-alcoholic beverage
business as well. Accordingly
 we can offer no assurance that if we expand our business beyond NARTD teas
 we will be able to effectively
develop
 produce
 market and distribute such beverages
 and such failure could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial
condition
 results of operations and cash flows.

Act
 and the other rules and regulations of the SEC
 including Sarbanes-Oxley
 upon consummation of the Business Combination with
LIBB and Cullen as described in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K. These requirements and rules may place a strain on our systems
and resources and those of our subsidiaries
 including LIBB
 which was not previously subject to such regulation. For example
the Exchange Act requires that we file annual
 quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition
and Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.
These reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on our management
 administrative
 operational and accounting
resources
 will make certain activities more time-consuming and will cause us to incur significant legal
 accounting and other
expenses that we had not previously incurred. Furthermore
 the expenses incurred by public companies
 generally
 for reporting
and corporate governance purposes have been increasing
 which may further strain our resources. We may need to upgrade our systems
or create new systems
 implement additional financial and management controls
 reporting systems and procedures
 expand or outsource
our internal audit function
 and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives
in a timely and effective fashion
 our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to
reporting companies could be impaired. In addition
 our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties in complying
with these reporting and other requirements while focusing on executing our business strategy. Our incremental general and administrative
expenses as a publicly traded corporation will include costs associated with reports to stockholders
 tax returns
 investor relations
registrar and transfer agent&rsquo;s fees
 incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director compensation.
During 2015
 we estimate that we incurred approximately $283
000 in additional costs in connection with being a public company
excluding compensation to directors and additional employees and all stock-based compensation. We cannot predict or estimate the
amount of the additional costs we may incur in future years
 the timing of any increases in such costs or the degree of impact
that our management&rsquo;s attention to these matters will have on our business.



    
    



404 of Sarbanes-Oxley as early as December 31
 2016
 although as an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; we will be exempt from
certain of its requirements for so long as we remain as such. For example
 Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we and our
independent auditors report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; however
 as an &ldquo;emerging
growth company&rdquo; we may take advantage of an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement. Once we are no longer an
&ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; or
 if prior to such date
 we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption
we will be required to include an opinion from our independent auditors on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting
 unless at such time we are a &ldquo;non-accelerated filer.&rdquo; We currently qualify as a &ldquo;non-accelerated filer&rdquo;
and will generally continue to qualify as such for each fiscal year thereafter where our public float remains below $75 million
as of the last day of the second fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year
 except that
 regardless of our public float
 we will
continue to be a &ldquo;non-accelerated filer&rdquo; until we have filed our first annual report on Form 10-K and have been subject
to the reporting obligations under the Exchange Act for 12 months. Management
 however
 is not exempt from Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley
and will be required to
 among other things
 maintain and periodically evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and
disclosure controls and procedures. In particular
 we will need to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal
control over financial reporting to allow us to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 as
required. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our
business
 prospects
 liquidity
 results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore
 if we are unable to satisfy our obligations
as a public company
 we could be subject to fines
 sanctions and other regulatory action.


&rdquo; we also intend
to continue to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not &ldquo;emerging growth companies&rdquo; including
 but not limited to
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements
 and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition
as a &ldquo;smaller reporting company
&rdquo; we are permitted to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements
 some of which
are the same as the exemptions available to an &ldquo;emerging growth company.&rdquo; In general
 we will remain a &ldquo;smaller
reporting company&rdquo; for each fiscal year where our public float remains below $75 million as of the last day of the second
fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year. We intend to take advantage of these exemptions and reduced reporting requirements until
we are no longer an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and/or a &ldquo;smaller reporting company
&rdquo; at which time
 we expect
to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with these additional
requirements
 including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley.

We may become subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions
and you may have difficulty selling shares of the common stock.


15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act
 commonly referred to as the &ldquo;penny stock rule.&rdquo; Section 15(g) sets forth
certain requirements for transactions in penny stock
 and Rule 15g-9(d) incorporates the definition of &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo;
that is found in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. The SEC generally defines a penny stock to be any equity security that has a
market price less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions. We may become subject to the SEC&rsquo;s penny stock rules
if the market price of our common stock declines.


stock
 trading in the shares of the common stock may become subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
who sell penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. An individual qualifies as an accredited
investor if he or she
 together with his or her spouse
 has assets in excess of $1
000
000 (excluding the value of such person&rsquo;s
primary residence) or annual income exceeding $200
000 or $300
000 together with their spouse. For transactions covered by these
rules
 broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such security and must have the purchaser&rsquo;s
written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally
 for any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
the rules require the delivery
 prior to the first transaction
 of a risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC relating to the
penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative
and current quotations for the securities. Finally
 monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the
penny stocks held in an account and information to the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently
 these rules may restrict the
ability of broker-dealer to trade and/or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to
sell their shares of common stock.



    
    



 there can
be no assurance that our shares of common stock will qualify for an exemption from the penny stock rule. In any event
 even if
the common stock was exempt from the penny stock rule
 we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act
 which gives
the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the SEC finds that such a restriction
would be in the public interest.

 LIBB. We are engaged in the production and distribution of premium NARTD tea in the beverage industry. We are currently
organized around our flagship brand Long Island Iced Tea
 a premium NARTD tea made from a proprietary recipe and with quality components
sold primarily on the East Coast of the United States through a network of national and regional retail chains and distributors.
Our mission is to provide consumers with premium iced tea offered at an affordable price.



    
    



beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers. There are two major target markets for Long Island Iced Tea: consumers
on the go and health conscious consumers. Consumers on the go are families
 employees
 students and other consumers who lead a
busy lifestyle. With increasingly hectic and demanding schedules
 there is a need for products that are accessible and readily
available. Health conscious consumers are individuals who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included
in their diets
 causing them to shift away from the less healthy options such as CSDs towards alternative beverages such as iced
tea.

are highlights of our operating results for the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014:


. During the year ended December 31
 2015
 we had net sales of $1
899
230
 an increase of $154
790 over the
year ended December 31
 2014. The primary drivers of this change were increases in our gallon sales which were launched for the
first time in May 2015 as well as expansion into new markets. These increases were offset by a decline in our sales to Costco from
the prior year as our product was not carried in Costco&rsquo;s product line
 and we performed fewer road shows in the current
year.


. Our margin increased by 4% for the year ended December 31
 2015 as compared to the year ended December
                                                                    31

                                                                    fact that the Company received a credit of $120
000 from one of the
                                                                    Company&rsquo;s vendors related to production issues during the first quarter of 2015
 which resulted in a reduction of the
                                                                    cost of the inventory affected by the production issues. Our ability to sell this inventory has resulted in improved margins
                                                                    of approximately 6% during the year ended December 31
 2015. These positive impacts were partially offset by the addition of
                                                                    smaller                                                                     margin

. During the year ended December 31
 2015
 our operating expenses were $3
395
319
 an increase of
$113
942 as compared to the year ended December 31
 2014. These increases were primarily the result of costs for stock based compensation
and other fees related to our board of directors and advisory board as well as an increase in our general and administrative salaries.
These increases were offset by decreases in operating expenses for the year-end period related primarily to decreased advertising
and other marketing expenses as a result of the cost of our marketing campaigns for 2015 as well as decreased costs related to
the performance of our roadshows at Costco as compared to the prior year.


 our cash generated from operations has not been
sufficient to meet our expenses. Accordingly
 we have historically financed our business through the sale of equity interests or
through the issuance of promissory notes. During the year ended December 31
 2015
 our cash flows used in operations were $3
084
756
and our net cash provided by financing activities was $2

 we may need
to continue to raise additional funds through private equity offerings

 or other means. There are no assurances
that we will be able to raise such funds on acceptable terms or at all.


in Our Business


are as follows:


We believe that using various marketing tools
 which may result in significant advertising expenses
 will be necessary in order
to increase product awareness in order to compete with our competitors
 including large and well established brands with access
to significant capital resources.


Customer trends and tastes can change for a variety of reasons including health consciousness
 government regulations and variation
in demographics. We will need to be able to adapt to changing preferences in the future.


Our sales growth is dependent upon maintaining our relationships with existing and future customers who may generate substantial
portions of our revenue
 which includes sales to retailers where there may be concentrations. During the year ended December 31
2014
 from April through September
 we sold to Costco both at road shows as well as in Costco&rsquo;s product line
 which represented
32% of the Company&rsquo;s sales. While the Company performed road shows at Costco through September 2015
 sales to Costco decreased
from approximately $562
000 for the year ended December 31
 2014 to $118
000 for the year ended December 31
 2015. This was due
to the fact that for the year ended December 31
 2014
 we performed more road shows and product demonstrations than during the
year ended December 31
 2015. In addition
 during the year ended December 31
 2014 we were sold in Costco&rsquo;s product line
while our product was not sold in Costco&rsquo;s regular product line during the year ended December 31
 2015. We are currently
not performing road shows at Costco
 and our product is not currently part of Costco&rsquo;s regular product line. However
 another
customer
 Wakefern Food Corp.
 accounted for 10% of our sales during the year ended December 31
 2015. Wakefern Food Corp. was
a new customer in the second half of 2015.


Our sales are subject to seasonality. Our sales are typically the strongest in the summer months in the northeastern United
States.


We are currently involved in litigation. Please refer to Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10-K. There are no assurances that there
will be successful outcomes to these matters.


We developed a gallon product line featuring four of our existing flavors in May 2015. The Company&rsquo;s gross margins are
minimal on this product. As a result of the minimal gross margins and the expenses related to delivery of the product to the end
customers
 we recorded an adjustment of $41
790 to reduce the cost of our gallons to the estimated net realizable value.


We are exploring potential opportunities to expand our business to include alcoholic beverages. This expansion may require
a substantial investment of resources and management time
 and there can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful.




United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of the assets and liabilities
 revenues and expenses
 and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in these
consolidated financial statements. We believe that
 of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 of the financial statements
included in this Form 10-K)
 the following policies are the most critical.



    
    





customers. Net sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met: (1) the price is fixed and determined; (2) evidence
of a binding arrangement exists (generally
 purchase orders); (3) products have been delivered and there is no future performance

with customers designed to increase the sale of its products. Among these programs are arrangements under which allowances can
be earned by customers for attaining agreed upon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs. The Company
believes that its participation in these programs is essential to ensuring volume and revenue growth in a competitive marketplace.
The costs of all these various programs are recorded as a reduction of sales in the consolidated financial statements.

 generally without requiring collateral
 based on its evaluation of the customer&rsquo;s
financial condition. Potential losses on the Company&rsquo;s receivables are dependent on each individual customer&rsquo;s financial
condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date. The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net
realizable value. Typically
 accounts receivable have terms of net 30 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure
to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances
by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its high-risk
customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the Company&rsquo;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the
amount due. Accounts receivable are stated at the amounts management expects to collect.

 the Business Combination was treated
as an acquisition of Cullen by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB
 as the former LIBB members hold a large percentage of the
Company&rsquo;s shares and exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the consolidated entity
and the Company was a public shell company at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;)
805-10-55-11 through 55-15
 the merger or acquisition of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell with nominal
assets is considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business combination. As a result
 the condensed consolidated
balance sheet
 statement of operations
 and statement of cash flows of LIBB have been retroactively updated to reflect the recapitalization.
Additionally
 the historical condensed consolidated financial statements of LIBB are now reflected as those of the Company.

 2015 increased by
$154
790
 or 9%
 to $1
899
230 as compared to $1
744
440 for the year ended December 31
 2014. The sales increase was primarily
driven by the sales of our gallons which were introduced during May 2015. Sales of our gallons were approximately $351
000 during
the year ended December 31
 2015
 including sales to one customer which accounted for approximately 10% of our sales for the year
ended December 31
 2015. The Company also experienced an increase in sales as a result of the Company&rsquo;s focus on increasing
brand recognition and expanding its customer base through the utilization of new distributors particularly in the New Jersey
 Philadelphia
Florida
 Virginia
 and New England areas. These sales increases were offset by decreases in our sales to Costco from approximately
$562
000 for the year ended December 31
 2015 to approximately $118
000 for the year ended December 31
 2014. This was due to the
fact that for the year ended December 31
 2014
 we performed more road shows and product demonstrations. In addition
 during the
year ended December 31
 2014 we were sold in Costco&rsquo;s product line. During the year ended December 31
 2015
 our product
was not sold in Costco&rsquo;s regular product line.


796
 or 43%
 from $240
294 for
the year ended December 31
 2014 to $343
090 for the year ended December 31
 2015. Gross profit percentage increased by 4% from
14% for the year ended December 31
 2014 to 18% for the year ended December 31
 2015. The primary reason for the increase was due
to the fact that the Company received a credit of $120
000 from one of the Company&rsquo;s vendors related to production issues.
The cost of the inventory affected by these production issues was reduced by $91
523 resulting in a positive impact of $28
477
on our gross profit. The Company maintained this inventory
 and as a result
 sales of this inventory over the remainder of this
fiscal year resulted in a positive impact on our margins which may not be indicative of future results. Our margins were also positively
impacted by the fact that in some regions we were selling directly to retailers which resulted in higher case prices. These increases
in our margins were offset by the sales of our gallon product line
 which have lower gross margins. In addition
 during the year
ended December 31
 2015
 we recorded an adjustment of $41
790 to reduce the cost of our gallons to the estimated net realizable
value
 which further offset the increase in our margins.



    
    



expenses

 increased by $872
403
 or 81%
 to $1
946
270 as compared to $1
073
867 for the year ended December 31
 2014. During the
year ended December 31
 2015
 costs incurred related to our board of directors and advisory board were $240
000
 which consisted
of fees to be paid in common stock to the directors and advisory board members
 as compared to $0 during the year ended December
31
 2014. During the year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company&rsquo;s general and administrative salaries increased by $251
624
as compared to the year ended December 31
 2014. This was primarily the result of officers&rsquo; salaries including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of the Company. In addition
 the Company incurred $251
019 in stock based compensation
expense that was allocated to general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31
 2015. In addition
 there were
increases in insurance expense of $54
538 primarily related to our directors and officers insurance. Depreciation and amortization
expense increased by $39
481 primarily as a result of increased capital expenditures in the prior year related to display items
such as wood racks and refrigerators as well as automobiles and trucks. SEC filing expenses
 stock transfer fees
 and other filing
fees also increased by $63
567
 primarily as a result of the fact that the Company became a public entity on May 27
 2015. The
Company also experienced increases in office expenses
 rent expense (including storage fees)
 and bad debt expense. These increases

 decreased by approximately $232

 2015 as compared to the

000
as a commitment fee

390 as a non-accountable expense allowance. In addition
 at the final closing
we issued the placement agent a warrant to purchase 15
575 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share.
As we did not sell the full $3
000
000 of units in the October Private Placement
 the placement agent was not entitled to a right

 2015
 we commenced the February Private Placement

 2015
 we completed the Business Combination contemplated
by the Merger Agreement. Prior to the closing of the Business Combination
 we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cullen formed solely
for the purpose of consummating the Business Combination
 LIBB was a private operating company and Cullen was a public company
seeking alternative strategic opportunities in all industries and regions in an effort to maximize stockholder value. Upon the
closing of the Business Combination
 we became the new public company and Cullen and LIBB became wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours.
As a result of the consummation of the Business Combination
 we gained access to the cash held by Cullen of $120
841. Under the
Merger Agreement
 upon consummation of the Business Combination
 the holders of the LIBB membership interests received 2
633
334
shares of Company common stock
 subject to adjustment based on LIBB&rsquo;s and Cullen&rsquo;s net working capital at the closing.
On July 16
 2015
 the payment of the net working capital adjustment under the Merger Agreement was waived by the parties.




 LIBB entered into various loan agreements for the
purchase of trucks and automobiles. The total amount of borrowing for these loans was $84
795. The loans require monthly installments
of principal ranging from $282 to $758 per month. Interest rates on these loans range from 3.59% to 10.74%. These loans mature
at various dates through 2019.

&rdquo;). The
Nortle Loan was secured by the inventory and accounts receivable of LIBB. The Nortle Loan provided for Nortle to lend the Company
an aggregate of $200
000
 bearing interest at 6% per annum. The Nortle Loan and all accrued interest thereon
 were due and payable
on August 31
 2014. The Nortle Option Agreement provided that through October 18
 2013
 Nortle had the option to loan LIBB an additional
$300
000
 on the same terms as the Nortle Loan (&ldquo;Nortle Option&rdquo;). In the event that Nortle did not exercise the Nortle
Option by October 18
 2013
 then on such date
 the interest rate on the existing loan with Nortle would increase to 12% per annum
for the remaining term. Due to the fact that the Nortle Option to advance additional funds was not exercised
 the interest rate
was increased to 12% per annum. On June 25
 2014
 Nortle converted its loan and accrued interest of $217
951 into equity interests
of LIBB. Such equity interests were converted into shares of our common stock in the Business Combination.

option to loan LIBB an additional $600

000 of the loan to repay
certain outstanding indebtedness. On December 5
 2013
 Cullen exercised its option and extended to LIBB an additional loan in the
amount of $600
000 also bearing interest at 6% per annum with principal and accrued interest due on August 31
 2014. On April 1
2014

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING










and Procedures



to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the rules and forms of the SEC.
Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Accounting
Officer
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As required by paragraph (b) of Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act
 our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive) and Chief Accounting Officer
(our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2015. Based on this evaluation
 our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in paragraph
(e) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) were not effective as December 31
 2015 due to a material weakness in
our internal control over financial reporting as described below.


Oversight Board&rsquo;s Auditing Standard No. 5
 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial
reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company&rsquo;s annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined that our internal control of financial reporting
had the following material weakness:


Due
to the small size of the Company
 the Company does not maintain sufficient segregation of duties to ensure the processing
 review
and authorization of all transactions including non-routine transactions.


The Company is evaluating this weakness to determine the appropriate remedy. Because disclosure controls and procedures include
those components of internal control over financial reporting that provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 management
determined that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the foregoing material weakness in its
internal control over financial reporting.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR








 2015
 we entered into a reimbursement agreement
&rdquo;)
 an entity managed by Philip Thomas
 our Chief Executive Officer and a
director of ours
 and certain of his family members
 and owned by Mr. Thomas&rsquo; father. In exchange for the exclusive right
to stock vending machines owned by Magnum
 we agreed to reimburse Magnum for certain costs that Magnum incurred to acquire the
machines. The reimbursements will be made in 35 monthly payments
 the first three in the amount of $14
544 and the remaining
payments in the amount of $3
819. Upon completion of these payments
 Magnum will transfer the vending machines to us. In addition
in exchange for the right to stock certain other vending machines that Magnum has the right to use
 we agreed to purchase the products
required to be displayed in those vending machines from Magnum
 at a price equal to Magnum&rsquo;s cost for such products. We may
terminate the agreement and all obligations to make future payments on ten days&rsquo; written notice to Magnum.


 2015
 we entered into (the Credit
Agreement
 as amended as of January 10
 2016
 by and among LIBB
 us and the Lender. The Lender is controlled by Eric Watson
who currently beneficially owns approximately 28.1% of our outstanding common stock. The Credit Agreement provides for a
revolving Credit Facility in an initial Available Amount of up to $1
000
000
 subject to increases as provided in the Credit
Agreement
 up to a maximum Facility Amount of $5
000
000. We also paid the Lender a one-time facility fee equal to 1.75% of
the Facility Amount
 which was capitalized and added to the principal amount of the loan
 and will pay the Lender $30
000 for
its expenses at the maturity date. On March 17
 2016
 the Lenders approved an increase of $500
000 in the Available Amount
under the Credit Agreement and approved advances under the Credit Agreement in the same amount
 of which $250
000 will be
advanced no later than March 24
 2016 and the remaining $250
000 will be advanced no later than April 22
 2016. The Credit
Facility bears interest at rate equal to the prime rate plus 7.5%
 compounded quarterly
 and matures on November 23
 2018. As
of December 31
 2015
 the outstanding balance of the loans under the Credit Facility was approximately $1
091
571
 which is
also the largest amount outstanding since the inception of the loans
 but which excludes the $500
000 of advances approved on
March 17
 2016. No principal or interest has been paid since the inception of the loans
 except that $4
071 of interest was
compounded by adding to the outstanding balance of the loans. The loans under the Credit Agreement are evidenced by the
Lender Note. The Lender may elect to convert the outstanding principal and interest under the Lender Note into shares of our
common stock at a conversion price of $4.00 per share. In addition
 in connection with the establishment of the
Credit Facility
 we issued the Lender Warrant to the Lender. The Lender Warrant entitles the holder to purchase 1

 we adopted a Related
Person Policy that requires us (and our subsidiaries
 including LIBB) to avoid
 wherever possible
 all related party transactions
that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests
 except as approved by unconflicted executives
 the board of directors
or audit committee in accordance with guidelines approved by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions
are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed the lesser of $120
000
or one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years
 (2) the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is a participant
 and (3) any (a) executive officer
 director or nominee for election as a director
 (b) greater
than 5% beneficial owner of our shares of common stock
 or (c) immediate family member
 of the persons referred to in clauses (a)
and (b)
 has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than
10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests
that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person
or a member of his or her family
 receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.


 pursuant to its written charter
 will be responsible
for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions. The audit committee will
consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction
 including whether the related party
transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar
circumstances and the extent of the related party&rsquo;s interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval
of any transaction in which he is a related party
 but that director is required to provide the audit committee with all material
information concerning the transaction. Additionally
 we will require each of its directors and executive officers to complete
an annual directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.


party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director
 employee
or officer.


    
    





exchange
 we have elected to adhere to the rules of Nasdaq in determining whether a director is independent. Our board of directors
consults with its counsel to ensure that the board&rsquo;s determinations are consistent with those rules and all relevant securities
and other laws and regulations regarding the independence of directors. Nasdaq requires that a majority of the board must be composed
of &ldquo;independent directors
&rdquo; which is defined generally as a person other than an officer of a company
 who does not
have a relationship with the company that would interfere with the director&rsquo;s exercise of independent judgment in carrying
out the responsibilities of a director. Consistent with these considerations
 we have determined that each of Messrs. Hanson and

significant estimates made by management

our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

LONG ISLAND ICED TEA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES



NOTE 1 &ndash; BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
 LIQUIDITY AND MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S
PLANS




 a Delaware C-Corporation
 was formed
on December 23
 2014. Long Island Iced Tea Corp. was formed in order to allow for the completion of mergers between Cullen Agricultural
Holding Corp. (&ldquo;Cullen&rdquo;) and Long Island Brand Beverages LLC (&ldquo;LIBB&rdquo;). As a result of the merger which
was consummated on May 27
 2015
 Long Island Iced Tea Corp. consisted of its wholly owned subsidiaries
 Long Island Brand Beverages
LLC (its operating subsidiary) and Cullen Agricultural Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
 Cullen Agricultural Technologies
Inc. and Natural Dairy
 Inc. (collectively the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;).


 2014
 the Company entered into a merger
agreement (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;)
 as amended as of April 23
 2015
 with Cullen
 a public company
 LIBB
 Cullen Merger Sub
Inc. (&ldquo;Cullen Merger Sub&rdquo;)
 LIBB Acquisition Sub
 LLC (&ldquo;LIBB Merger Sub&rdquo;)
 and the founders of LIBB
(&ldquo;Founders&rdquo;). Pursuant to the merger agreement
 (a) Cullen Merger Sub was to be merged with and into Cullen
 with
Cullen surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Long Island Iced Tea Corp. and (b) LIBB Merger Sub was to be
merged with and into LIBB
 with LIBB surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Long Island Iced Tea Corp. (the
&ldquo;Mergers&rdquo;).


 upon consummation of the company merger
the holders of the LIBB membership interests (the &ldquo;LIBB members&rdquo;) would receive 2
633
334 shares of common stock of
Holdco (or approximately 63%)
 subject to adjustment based on LIBB&rsquo;s and Cullen&rsquo;s net working capital at closing.


less than its net working capital target
 the number of shares of Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rsquo;s common stock to be received
by the LIBB members at the closing was to be reduced by a number of shares
 allocated among the LIBB members pro rata
 equal to
such deficiency divided by $3.00. If LIBB&rsquo;s estimated net working capital at the closing was more than its net working capital
target
 the number of shares of Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rsquo;s common stock to be received by the LIBB members at the closing
was to be increased by a number of shares
 allocated among the LIBB members pro rata
 equal to such excess divided by $3.00. LIBB&rsquo;s
net working capital target was $70
069
 except that for each day after February 15
 2015
 the target was reduced by $3
333 for
each day after such date through and including the closing date.


more than its net working capital target
 the number of shares of Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rsquo;s common stock to be received
by the LIBB members at the closing was to be reduced by a number of shares
 allocated among the LIBB members pro rata
 equal to
such excess divided by $3.00. If Cullen&rsquo;s estimated net working capital at the closing was less than its net working capital
target
 the number of shares of Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rsquo;s common stock to be received by the LIBB members at the closing
was to be increased by a number of shares
 allocated among the LIBB members pro rata
 equal to such deficiency divided by $3.00.
Cullen&rsquo;s net working capital target was $786
985
 except that for each day after February 15
 2015
 the target was reduced
by $667 for each day after such date through and including the closing date.


 2015
 the Mergers were consummated.


 2015
 the parties to the Mergers agreed to waive the
provisions of the working capital adjustment.


 Long Island Iced
Tea Corp.&rsquo;s and LIBB&rsquo;s post-Closing rights to indemnification under the Merger Agreement
 an aggregate of 500
000
of the Merger Shares (&ldquo; Indemnity Shares &rdquo;) were placed in escrow
 in accordance with an escrow agreement (the
&ldquo; Escrow Agreement &rdquo;) executed by Long Island Iced Tea Corp.
 Philip Thomas
 as the representative of the LIBB
members under the Merger Agreement (the &ldquo; LIBB Representative &rdquo;)
 and Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust
Company
 as escrow agent (the &ldquo; Escrow Agent &rdquo;). The escrow is the sole remedy for Cullen
 Long Island Iced Tea
Corp. and LIBB for their rights to indemnification under the Merger Agreement. The Members&rsquo; right to indemnification
will be satisfied through the issuance by Long Island Iced Tea Corp. of up to 500
000 additional shares of Long Island Iced
Tea Corp.&rsquo;s Common Stock.


    
    


LONG ISLAND ICED TEA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES




registered public accounting firm has issued its report relating to its financial statement for its fiscal year ending December
31
 2015
 the Indemnity Shares remaining in escrow will be released to the former LIBB Members except for any shares subject to
pending indemnification claims.


 the Mergers were treated as an acquisition
of Cullen by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB
 as the former LIBB members hold a large percent of the Long Island Iced Tea
Corp.&rsquo;s shares and will exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the consolidated entity
and the Company was a public shell company at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;)
805-10-55-11 through 55-15
 the merger or acquisition of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell with nominal
assets is considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business combination. As a result
 the consolidated balance
sheets
 statements of operations
 and statements of cash flows of LIBB have been retroactively updated to reflect the recapitalization.
Additionally
 the historical consolidated financial statements of LIBB are now reflected as those of the Company.

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;) requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements
 and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for
each period. Actual results could differ from those which result from using such estimates. Management utilizes various other
estimates
 including but not limited to
 assessing the collectability of accounts receivable
 accrual of rebates to
customers
 the valuation of inventory
 determining the estimated lives of long-lived assets
 determining the potential
impairment of intangibles
 the fair value of warrants issued

 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting
and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of
the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or
loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income
taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&rsquo;s assets and
liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates
the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion
or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might
be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&rsquo;s opinion
 adequate provisions
for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals
of reserves may be necessary.


 it has been concluded that
there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.
The evaluation was performed for the 2015 tax year

taxes. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any
adjustments that will result in a material change to its financial position or results of operations.


associated with tax audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties
and interest for years ended December 31
 2015 and December 31

change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant
payments
 accruals or material deviations from its position.




with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (&ldquo;ASC 718&rdquo;). ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based awards
exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718
 stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over the employee&rsquo;s requisite service period (generally
the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&rsquo;s common stock options is estimated using the Black
Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility
 dividend rate
 risk free interest rate and the
expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical volatility of comparable companies over the
most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available information indicates that future volatility
may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company does not expect to pay or declare any
cash dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant exercise activity on stock options.
Due to the lack of historical information
 the Company determined the expected term of its stock option awards issued using the
simplified method. The simplified method assumes each vesting tranche of the award has a term equal to the midpoint between when
the award vests and when the award expires. The Company expenses stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method.

in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance

&ldquo;Accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after
the requisite service period
&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2014-12&rdquo;) which requires performance-based awards with a performance target
that affects vesting and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period to be accounted for as
a performance condition. If performance targets are clearly defined and it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved
stock-based expense should be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. This guidance will be effective for fiscal
years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15
 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is in the process of evaluating the provisions of the ASU and assessing the potential effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial position

 &ldquo;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&rdquo; related to
disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on
determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new
standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern
within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain
disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 which requires entities
to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability
on the balance sheet as opposed to being presented as a deferred charge. ASU 2015-03 does not contain guidance for debt issuance
costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Consequently
 in August 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to add paragraphs indicating
that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements
as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement
regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The effective date of these pronouncements
is for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015
 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this new guidance
to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements. The Company currently capitalizes debt issuance
costs related to its line of credit agreement as an asset in accordance with ASU 2015-03.


 the FASB issued ASU
2015-11
 &ldquo;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory&rdquo;
 which changed the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower
of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling prices
in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. No other changes
were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on
its financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 which simplifies
the presentation of deferred income taxes in a classified statement of financial position. Current GAAP require an entity to
separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. ASU 2015-17 amends current GAAP to require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as
noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This pronouncement is effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods with earlier
application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect this new
guidance to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.



 the FASB
 issued ASU 2016-01
&ldquo;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities
&rdquo; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and
measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial
instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred
tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and are to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment
to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not
permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option
resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of adopting this standard.


 the FASB issued new lease accounting
guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required to
recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&lsquo;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a
discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&rsquo;s right to use
 or control the
use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less.
Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years
beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon
issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases)
must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the
earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any
transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not
apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the
consolidated financial statements.

I understand that I must bear the economic risk of the investment in the Option Shares
 which cannot be sold by me unless they
are registered under the 1933 Act or an exemption therefrom is available thereunder and that the Company is under no obligation
to register the Option Shares for sale under the 1933 Act;



    
    



I agree that I will not sell
 transfer by any means or otherwise dispose of the Option Shares acquired by me hereby except
in accordance with Company&rsquo;s Insider Trading Policy;


in my position with the Company
 I have had both the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the officers and
directors of the Company and all persons acting on its behalf concerning the terms and conditions of the offer made hereunder and
to obtain any additional information to the extent the Company possesses or may possess such information or can acquire it without
unreasonable effort or expense necessary to verify the accuracy of the information obtained pursuant to clause (ii) above;


my rights with respect to the Option Shares shall
 in all respects
 be subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option
Agreement.


I am aware that the Company shall place stop transfer orders with its transfer agent against the transfer of the Option Shares
in the absence of registration under the 1933 Act or an exemption therefrom as provided herein; and


if
 at the time of issuance of the Option Shares
 the issuance of such shares have not been registered under the 1933 Act
the certificates evidencing the Option Shares shall bear the following legends:


been acquired for investment and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The shares may not be sold or transferred
in the absence of such registration or an exemption therefrom under said Act.&rdquo;


been acquired pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement dated as of May 27
 2015
 a copy of which is on file with the Company
 and may
not be transferred
 pledged or disposed of except in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof.&quot;

 the number of shares of Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&amp;#8217;s common stock to be received by the LIBB members at the closing was to be increased by a number of shares
 allocated among the LIBB members pro rata
 equal to such excess divided by $3.00. LIBB&amp;#8217;s net working capital target was $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;70
069&lt;/font&gt;
 except that for each day after February 15

 2015
 the parties to the Mergers agreed to waive the provisions of the working capital adjustment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=CLEAR:both; FONT-FAMILY:Times New Roman;FONT-SIZE: 10pt;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&gt; &lt;font style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;font style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;&lt;font style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;To provide a fund for satisfaction of Cullen

 the Mergers were treated as an acquisition of Cullen by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB
 as the former LIBB members hold a large percent of the Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&amp;#8217;s shares and will exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the consolidated entity and the Company was a public shell company at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (&amp;#8220;ASC&amp;#8221;) 805-10-55-11 through 55-15
 the merger or acquisition of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell with nominal assets is considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business combination. As a result
 the consolidated balance sheets
 statements of operations
 and statements of cash flows of LIBB have been retroactively updated to reflect the recapitalization. Additionally

 2015
 the Company completed the Mergers
 whereby LIBB was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of Cullen. The historical financial statements were those of LIBB. From the date of the Mergers
 the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations began to be taxed as a C corporation. Prior to the Mergers
 the Company&amp;#8217;s operations were taxed as a limited liability company
 whereby the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns. Therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for operating results prior to May 27

 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASC 740&amp;#8221;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&amp;#8217;s assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&amp;#8217;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates

 it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2015 tax year

 2015 and December 31
 2014. The Company does not expect its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments

 Compensation - Stock Compensation (&amp;#8220;ASC 718&amp;#8221;). ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718
 stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over the employee&amp;#8217;s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock options is estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility
 dividend rate
 risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical volatility of comparable companies over the most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available information indicates that future volatility may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company does not expect to pay or declare any cash dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant exercise activity on stock options. Due to the lack of historical information

 &amp;#8220;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. In accordance with ASC 505-50

 the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes those with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Company&amp;#8217;s common shares during the periods presented. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes outstanding options in periods where the exercise of such options would be antidilutive. For the year ended December 31

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). It outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09&amp;#160;is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods
 for public companies
 and for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods

 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12
 &amp;#8220;Accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period
&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2014-12&amp;#8221;) which requires performance-based awards with a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period to be accounted for as a performance condition. If performance targets are clearly defined and it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved
 stock-based expense should be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-15
 &amp;#8220;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&amp;#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#8221; related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December&amp;#160;15

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 which requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability on the balance sheet as opposed to being presented as a deferred charge. ASU 2015-03 does not contain guidance for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Consequently
 in August 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to add paragraphs indicating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement
 regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The effective date of these pronouncements is for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
 &amp;#8220;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory&amp;#8221;
 which changed the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes in a classified statement of financial position. Current GAAP require an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 amends current GAAP to require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This pronouncement is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB
 issued ASU 2016-01
 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
&amp;#8221; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017

 the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 &lt;i&gt;Leases).&lt;/i&gt; Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&amp;#8216;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after

 the Company completed the Mergers
 whereby LIBB was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of Cullen. The historical financial statements were those of LIBB. From the date of the Mergers
 the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations began to be taxed as a C corporation. Prior to the Mergers
 the Company&amp;#8217;s operations were taxed as a limited liability company
 whereby the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns. Therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for operating results prior to May 27

 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASC 740&amp;#8221;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&amp;#8217;s assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&amp;#8217;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates

 it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2015 tax year

 2015 and December 31
 2014. The Company does not expect its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments

 the Mergers represented a more than 50 percentage point change in ownership of Cullen
 with the result that Cullen&amp;#8217;s NOLs are subject to a limitation under Section 382. Upon a change of ownership under Section 382
 such losses
 provided that certain requirements for business continuity are met
 would be subject to an annual limitation based upon the fair value of Cullen multiplied by the long-term tax exempt bond rate. The company determined that it did not meet the business continuity requirements

 the Company determined that a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is required. As of December 31

 the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 the Company tested the domain name utilizing the qualitative method. Based on this analysis
 it was determined that there was no indicators of impairment as of December 31

000&lt;/font&gt;. The domain name is considered to have a perpetual life and as such

 an entity managed by Philip Thomas
 the Company&amp;#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company
 and certain of his family members. In exchange for the exclusive right to stock vending machines owned by Magnum
 the Company agreed to reimburse Magnum for the cost of products to stock the machines and the costs that Magnum incurred to acquire the machines including machines which were purchased with an equipment loan. The total principal amount of the payments underlying the agreement upon inception was $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;117

819&lt;/font&gt; with an interest rate of &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt; 10&lt;/font&gt;%. Upon completion of these payments in October 2018
 Magnum will transfer ownership of the vending machines to the Company. In addition
 in exchange for the right to stock certain other vending machines that the Company&amp;#160;has the right to use
 the Company agreed to purchase the products required to be displayed in those vending machines from Magnum
 at a price equal to Magnum&amp;#8217;s cost for such products (See Note 14). The Company may terminate the agreement and all obligations to make future payments on ten days&amp;#8217; written notice to Magnum. As of December 31
 2015
 the outstanding balance on the equipment loan was $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;113

000&lt;/font&gt;

 2014&lt;/font&gt;. The Cullen Loan Agreement provided Cullen with the option to loan the Company an additional $600
000. The Cullen Loan Agreement also required that the Company utilize $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;450
000&lt;/font&gt; of the loan to repay the Line of Credit &amp;#150; Member. On December 5

 2014&lt;/font&gt;. The maturity date of the Cullen Loans have been extended until March 15
 2016. These Cullen loans are secured by the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company. On March 26
 2015
 the Company received $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;250
000&lt;/font&gt; as proceeds from an additional loan from Cullen

 2016&lt;/font&gt;. On May 27

 the Company consummated the Mergers. In connection with the Mergers
 $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;1

 2013
 the Company and Nortle Holdings Limited (&amp;#8220;Nortle&amp;#8221;) entered into a loan (&amp;#8220;Nortle Loan&amp;#8221;) and option agreement (&amp;#8220;Nortle Option Agreement&amp;#8221;). The Nortle Loan was secured by the inventory and accounts receivable of the Company. The Nortle Loan provided for Nortle to lend the Company an aggregate of $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;200
000&lt;/font&gt;
 bearing interest at &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;% per annum. The Nortle Loan and all accrued interest thereon
 was due and payable on &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;August 31
 2014&lt;/font&gt;. The Nortle Option Agreement provided that through &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;October 18
 2013&lt;/font&gt;
 Nortle had the option to loan the Company an additional $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;300
000&lt;/font&gt;
 on the same terms as the Nortle Loan (&amp;#8220;Nortle Option&amp;#8221;). In the event that Nortle did not exercise the Nortle Option by October 18
 2013
 then on such date
 the interest rate on the existing loan with Nortle would increase to &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt; 12&lt;/font&gt;% per annum for the remaining term. Due to the fact that the Nortle Option to advance additional funds was not exercised
 the interest rate was increased to 12% per annum. On June 25
 2014
 Nortle converted its loan and accrued interest of $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;217

 2014
 the Company and Ivory Castle Limited (&amp;#8220;Ivory Castle&amp;#8221;) entered into a loan (&amp;#8220;Ivory Castle Loan&amp;#8221;). The Ivory Castle Loan provided for Ivory Castle to lend the Company an aggregate of $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;1
300
000&lt;/font&gt; bearing interest at &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt; 6&lt;/font&gt;%. The Ivory Castle Loan
 together with accrued interest
 was due and payable on &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;August 31

309
107&lt;/font&gt; was converted into &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt; 54

 as a condition of the conversion
 the Company was required to obtain Ivory Castle&amp;#8217;s approval in the event of a proposed business combination or in the event that the Company seeks equity financing in excess of $1
000
000 prior to June 25
 2015. On May 4

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). It outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09&amp;#160;is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods
 for public companies
 and for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods

 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12
 &amp;#8220;Accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period
&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2014-12&amp;#8221;) which requires performance-based awards with a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period to be accounted for as a performance condition. If performance targets are clearly defined and it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved
 stock-based expense should be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-15
 &amp;#8220;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&amp;#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#8221; related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December&amp;#160;15

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 which requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability on the balance sheet as opposed to being presented as a deferred charge. ASU 2015-03 does not contain guidance for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Consequently
 in August 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to add paragraphs indicating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement
 regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The effective date of these pronouncements is for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
 &amp;#8220;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory&amp;#8221;
 which changed the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes in a classified statement of financial position. Current GAAP require an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 amends current GAAP to require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This pronouncement is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB
 issued ASU 2016-01
 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
&amp;#8221; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017

 the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 &lt;i&gt;Leases).&lt;/i&gt; Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&amp;#8216;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after

Effective May 27
 2015
 the Company completed the Mergers
 whereby LIBB was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of Cullen. The historical financial statements were those of LIBB. From the date of the Mergers
 the Company&#8217;s results of operations began to be taxed as a C corporation. Prior to the Mergers
 the Company&#8217;s operations were taxed as a limited liability company
 whereby the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns. Therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for operating results prior to May 27
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&#8217;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
Based on the Company&#8217;s evaluation
 it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2015 tax year
The Company&#8217;s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties and interest for years ended December 31
 2015 and December 31
 2014. The Company does not expect its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments
The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;). ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718
 stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over the employee&#8217;s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock options is estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility
 dividend rate
 risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical volatility of comparable companies over the most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available information indicates that future volatility may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company does not expect to pay or declare any cash dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant exercise activity on stock options. Due to the lack of historical information
 The Company accounts for stock and other equity instruments granted to consultants using the accounting guidance included in ASC 505-50
 &#8220;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. In accordance with ASC 505-50
Basic net earnings per common share is computed by dividing income/loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect
 in periods in which they have a dilutive effect
 the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes those with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Company&#8217;s common shares during the periods presented. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes outstanding options in periods where the exercise of such options would be antidilutive. For the year ended December 31

The carrying amounts of cash
 accounts receivable

In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). It outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09&#160;is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods
 for public companies
 and for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods
In June 2014
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12
 &#8220;Accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period
&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2014-12&#8221;) which requires performance-based awards with a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period to be accounted for as a performance condition. If performance targets are clearly defined and it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved
 stock-based expense should be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15
In August 2014
 the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-15
 &#8220;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221; related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December&#160;15
In April 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 which requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability on the balance sheet as opposed to being presented as a deferred charge. ASU 2015-03 does not contain guidance for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Consequently
 in August 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to add paragraphs indicating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement
 regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The effective date of these pronouncements is for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015
In July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
 &#8220;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory&#8221;
 which changed the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
In November 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes in a classified statement of financial position. Current GAAP require an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 amends current GAAP to require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This pronouncement is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15
In January 2016
 the FASB
 issued ASU 2016-01
 &#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
&#8221; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
In February 2016
 the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&#8216;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
The Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Based upon the review
 other than described in Note 1 &#150;Business Organization
 Liquidity
 and Management&#8217;s Plans
 Note 7 &#150; Line of Credit and Note 15 &#150; Subsequent Events
 the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.

 the Company does not recognize gains or losses on the disposal of individual units of equipment when the disposal occurs in the normal course of business. The Company capitalizes the costs of refurbishing its cold-drink containers and depreciates those costs over the estimated period until the next scheduled refurbishment or until the equipment is retired. The estimated useful lives are typically 3 to 5 years for office furniture and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis.

Income Tax
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
Effective May 27
 2015
 the Company completed the Mergers
 whereby LIBB was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of Cullen. The historical financial statements were those of LIBB. From the date of the Mergers
 the Company&#8217;s results of operations began to be taxed as a C corporation. Prior to the Mergers
 the Company&#8217;s operations were taxed as a limited liability company
 whereby the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns. Therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for operating results prior to May 27
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&#8217;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
Based on the Company&#8217;s evaluation
 it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2015 tax year
The Company&#8217;s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties and interest for years ended December 31
 2015 and December 31
 2014. The Company does not expect its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments
 accruals or material deviations from its position.



Earnings Per Share
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
Basic net earnings per common share is computed by dividing income/loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect
 in periods in which they have a dilutive effect
 the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes those with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Company&#8217;s common shares during the periods presented. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes outstanding options in periods where the exercise of such options would be antidilutive. For the year ended December 31

New Accounting Pronouncements
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). It outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09&#160;is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods
 for public companies
 and for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods
In June 2014
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12
 &#8220;Accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period
&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2014-12&#8221;) which requires performance-based awards with a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period to be accounted for as a performance condition. If performance targets are clearly defined and it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved
 stock-based expense should be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15
In August 2014
 the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-15
 &#8220;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221; related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December&#160;15
In April 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 which requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability on the balance sheet as opposed to being presented as a deferred charge. ASU 2015-03 does not contain guidance for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Consequently
 in August 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to add paragraphs indicating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement
 regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The effective date of these pronouncements is for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015
In July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
 &#8220;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory&#8221;
 which changed the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
In November 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes in a classified statement of financial position. Current GAAP require an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 amends current GAAP to require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This pronouncement is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15
In January 2016
 the FASB
 issued ASU 2016-01
 &#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
&#8221; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
In February 2016
 the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&#8216;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
