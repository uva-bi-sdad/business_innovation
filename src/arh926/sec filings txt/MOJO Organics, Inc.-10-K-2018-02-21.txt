PART
I
ITEM
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;BUSINESS

COMPANY
OVERVIEW

MOJO
Organics
 Inc. (&ldquo;MOJO&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) a Delaware Corporation is headquartered in Jersey City
 NJ. The
Company engages in new product development
 production
 marketing
 distribution and sales of beverage brands that are natural
and Non GMO Project Verified.

CURRENT
OPERATIONS

Sales
and Distribution

The
Company began selling MOJO Pure Coconut Water in December 2015. In addition to Pure Coconut Water
 the Company produces Sparkling
Coconut Water
 Coconut Water + Peach Mango Juice and Coconut Water + Pineapple Juice. We seek to grow the market share of our
products by expanding our distribution network through the relationships and efforts of our management and third party distribution
relationships.

Production


The
Company has multiple sources for its products.&nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s fruit sources are of high quality and are part of the
overall taste and quality of its products. &nbsp;The Company&rsquo;s current arrangements for production and packaging exceed
required levels.



The
beverage industry is competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition
 ingredient sourcing
 and
product shelf space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitors have similar distribution channels and retailers to deliver and sell their products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Government
Regulation

Within
the United States
 beverages are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &ldquo;FDA&rdquo;).&nbsp;&nbsp;As such
it is necessary for the Company to establish
 maintain and make available for inspection records as well as to develop labels
(including nutrition information) that meet FDA requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&rsquo;s production facilities are subject
to FDA regulation.



As
of February 21
 2018
 the Company had four employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also uses the services of contractors
 consultants
and other third-parties. We contract with food brokers to represent our products to sales channels. We utilize the services of
direct sales and distribution companies that sell our products to their customers. We contract with manufacturing facilities to
produce our products and outsource the storage and transportation of our products.

CORPORATE
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

The
Company was incorporated in 2007 and since then has undergone several changes to its business structure. MOJO Organics Inc is
headquartered in Jersey City
 and our internet site is www.mojoorganicsinc.com. MOJO&rsquo;s stock is traded on the OTC Markets
under the symbol &ldquo;MOJO&rdquo;. On January 20
 2016
 the Company approved a subscription agreement (the &ldquo;2016 Subscription&rdquo;)
whereby shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 $0.001 par value (&ldquo;Common Stock&rdquo;) were offered to accredited investors
for $0.35 per share. For every two shares purchased
 the investor received a warrant to acquire one share of Common Stock at an
exercise price of $0.70 per share exercisable for a period of two years from the date of issuance. The Company issued a total
of 964
286 shares of Common Stock and two year purchase warrants to acquire a total of 482
143 shares of Common Stock to four
accredited investors for consideration of $337
500. The warrants expired on February 16
 2018.&nbsp;


    
    

ITEM
1A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RISK FACTORS

In
addition to the other information set forth in this report
 you should consider the following factors
 which could materially
affect our business
 financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only
risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business
 financial condition or results of operations in future periods.

If
we are unable to expand our operations in the marketplace
 our growth rate could be negatively affected. 

Our
success depends in part on our ability to grow our business. We have adopted and implemented a strategic plan to increase awareness
of our products
 secure additional distribution channels
 and foster and strengthen our supply
 manufacturing and distribution
relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our strategic plan includes addressing changes in the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no assurance
that we will achieve the growth necessary to achieve our objectives.

We
could need additional capital in the future to expand our operations and execute our business objectives.

Should
we need additional capital to expand our operations
 financing transactions may include the issuance of equity
 debt securities
and obtaining credit facilities.

The
challenges of competing with other beverage companies could result in reductions to our revenue and operating margins.

The
nonalcoholic beverage segment of the beverage industry is competitive. We compete with numerous beverage companies
 including
those marketing similar products. All beverages companies are competing for stomach share on a daily basis which is approximately
64 oz. of fluid per day
 per person. Our success depends on our ability to secure distribution channels for our products
 our
ability to make consumers aware of our products and the appeal of our products to consumers.&nbsp;

Disruption
of supply
 increase in costs or shortage of ingredients could affect our operating results.

Availability
of supply and the prices charged by the producers of production inputs used in our products can be affected by a variety of factors
including the general demand by other buyers for the same fruits used by us in our products
 and politics and economics in the
regions in which our fruit is grown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The
quality of fruit we seek trades on a negotiated basis
 depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An increase
in the pricing of any fruit that we use in our products will have a negative effect on our margins. Higher energy costs may affect
the cost of transporting our supplies
 thereby increasing costs. Conversely
 lower fruit prices and energy prices will have a
positive result on transport and packaging costs.


    
    


We
use independent bottlers for the production and filling of our products and
 as such
 are subject to the bottler&rsquo;s production
and quality control. 

We
use independent bottlers for the production and filling of our products.&nbsp;&nbsp;We play an active role in the manufacturing
of our products
 supervision of the production process lies with the bottlers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly
 we are dependent on the
bottlers and their ability to meet production demands and to achieve product quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Litigation
and publicity concerning food quality
 health claims
 and other issues could expose us to significant liabilities.

Food
product businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from
product quality
 health claims
 allergens
 illness
 and injury. Adverse publicity about these allegations will negatively affect
us
 regardless of whether the allegations are true. In addition
 the food industry has been subject to a number of claims based
on the nutritional content of food products they sell
 and disclosure and advertising practices. Due to the inherent uncertainties
of litigation and regulatory proceedings
 we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome
will have an adverse impact on our business. In addition
 any litigation or regulatory proceedings may result in substantial costs.

Our
Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&ldquo;MD&amp;A&rdquo;) is provided
in addition to the accompanying financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations
 financial
condition and cash flows. MD&amp;A is organized as follows:



    
    
Critical Accounting
    Policies &mdash; Accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated
    in our reported financial results and forecasts.




    
    
Results of Operations
    &mdash; Analysis of our financial results comparing the year ended December 31
 2017 to 2016. 




    
    
Liquidity and Capital
    Resources &mdash; Analysis of changes in our cash flows
 and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of
    liquidity.


This
report includes a number of forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward looking statements are often identified by words like: believe
 expect
 estimate
 anticipate
intend
 project and similar expressions
 or words which
 by their nature
 refer to future events.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should not place
undue certainty on these forward looking statements
 which apply only as of the date of this annual report.&nbsp;&nbsp;These forward
looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
results or our predictions.

Critical
Accounting Policies

We
have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 which
requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the reporting period. We base these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions
we believe to be reasonable based upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur
 as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included
in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different
assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

All
of our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 to our financial statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies and estimates
which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties
 are the most pervasive and important
to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different
results under different assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation
of our financial statements:

Use
&nbsp;&mdash; The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (&quot;GAAP&quot;). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Stock-based
&nbsp;&mdash; ASC Topic 718
&rdquo; prescribes accounting
and reporting standards for employee stock-based compensation plans
 including employee stock options
 restricted stock
 employee
stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights.


    
    


ASC
Topic 718 requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value method. The Company accounts for employee
stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718.&nbsp;
Determining
the appropriate fair value of the stock-based compensation requires the input of subjective assumptions
 including the expected
life of the stock-based payment and stock price volatility. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing option model to
value its stock option awards which incorporate the Company&rsquo;s stock price
 volatility
 U.S. risk-free rate
 dividend rate
and estimated life.

The
Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50
 &ldquo;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees.&rdquo; &nbsp;ASC Topic 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever
is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of (i) common stock issued
for payments to non-employees is measured at the market price on the date of grant; (ii) equity instruments
 other than common
stock
 is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general
 we recognize an asset or expense in the same manner
as if it is to pay cash or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.

Fair
&nbsp;&mdash; Our short-term financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts receivable
accounts payable and other liabilities
 consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities. We believe that the fair
values of our current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
May 2014

with Customers
 which will supersede the current revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605
.
The ASC is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August
2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The new guidance will be effective
for public companies for annual periods beginning January 1
 2018. The ASU permits application of the new revenue recognition
guidance to be applied using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company currently recognizes revenue as soon as
delivery of goods has occurred. The new pronouncement will not have a material impact on the financial statements.

Results
of Operations

Years
Ended December 31
 2017 and 2016



During
the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company reported revenue of $1
314
722
 a decrease of $ 16
830 or 1.3% over revenue of $1
331
552
for the year ended December 31
 2016. The decline in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in private label business
 partially
offset by an increase in MOJO branded business. In addition to that
 there were ads and promotional activities that were done
at store levels in 2017. The costs of these ads were passed on to the company as sales deductions which reduced the 2017 revenue&nbsp;.


Cost
of Revenue

Cost
of Revenue includes finished goods purchase costs
 and freight in costs.&nbsp; Also included in Cost of Revenue are adjustments
made to inventory carrying amounts
 including markdowns to market.

For
the year ended December 31
 2017
 cost of revenue was $786
914 or 60% of revenue
 compared to $741
898 or 56% of revenue for the
year ended December 31
 2016. The increase is due to the increases in finished goods purchase costs and freight costs. Also
 during
the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company started the production of MOJO Sparkling Coconut Water.


    
    



Operating
Expenses

For
the year ended December 31
 2017
 selling
 general and administrative expenses were $1
762
876
 a decrease of $95
213 over selling
general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31
 2016 of $1
858
089.&nbsp;


This
decrease in selling
 general and administrative expenses of $95
213 was primarily comprised of a decrease in compensation costs
of $11
140 and a decrease in selling costs of $127
134 offset by an increase in stock based compensation costs of $111
130. Compensation
costs decreased by $11
140 in 2017 from 2016. This is primarily attributable to lower employee salary costs
 offset by an increase
in stock compensation costs. Selling costs
 including freight and delivery expenses
 broker fees and outside sales fees decreased
by $127
134 from 2016 to 2017. This is a result of the decrease in outside sales fees and lower sales commissions. 
Stock-based
compensation costs to directors and employees
 which consist of charges to income for vesting in connection with restricted stock
issuances
 stock options and warrants
 were $1
235
463 &nbsp;for the year ended December 31
 2017
 compared to $511
231 for the
year ended December 31
 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; This represents a reduction in selling
 general and administrative expenses of $724
232
Although stock-based compensation costs reduce the Company&rsquo;s earnings
 they do not reduce cash and have no effect on working
capital.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources



As
of December 31
 2017
 the Company had working capital of $359
814. Net cash used in operating activities was $16
311 for the year
ended December 31
 2017
 a decrease of $297
963 over net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31
 2016
of $314
274. Net cash provided by financing activities was $0 for the year ended December 31
 2017 compared to $337
500 for the
year ended December 31
 2016.

Working
Capital Needs

Our
working capital requirements increase as demand grows for our products. During 2017
 the Company did not require additional funding.
Due to increased demand
 the Company raised $337
500 in January and February 2016 through the issuance of Common Stock and warrants.
See Note 5 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further discussion. If the Company requires additional working capital
during the next twelve months
funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Financing transactions may include
the issuance of equity or debt securities or obtaining credit facilities.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures&nbsp;

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure
controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be
noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
regardless of how remote.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company&rsquo;s senior management
 consisting of the Company&rsquo;s principal
executive and financial officer and the Company&rsquo;s principal accounting officer
 the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the &ldquo;Evaluation Date&rdquo;). Based on this evaluation
the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and financial officer concluded
 as of the Evaluation Date
 that the Company&rsquo;s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
management of MOJO Organics
 Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Therefore
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In
evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this
evaluation
 our officers concluded that
 during the period covered by this annual report
 our internal controls over financial
reporting were not operating effectively.

As
previously reported
 the Company does not have an audit committee and is not currently obligated to have one. Management does
not believe that the lack of an audit committee is a material weakness.

Attestation
Report

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting as such report is not required for non-accelerated filers.



    
    




Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31
 2016 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.

500
000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
2012 Plan and the 2015 Plan
 respectively. The options were priced at the fair market value of the Common Stock and are immediately

On
October 20
 2015
 the 2015 Plan was approved by the Board of Directors.&nbsp;The 2015 Plan provides the Company with the ability
to issue stock options
 stock awards and/or restricted stock purchase&nbsp;offers for up to an aggregate of 1

ITEM
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Other
than as disclosed below and in this Form 10-K
 there have been no transactions
 since January 1
 2015
 or any currently proposed
transaction
 in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120
000 or 1% of the average
of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any of our directors
 executive officers
or beneficial holders of more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock
 or any of their respective immediate family members

had or will have any direct or material indirect interest.&nbsp;

On
March 2
 2017
 the Company entered into an amendment to the Spinner Agreement effective December 31
 2016 reducing the Spinner
Bonus Plan by 1
500
000 shares.

In
connection with two private placement offerings in March 2014
 investors received one purchase warrant at $0.91 per share for
each share of stock purchased. The warrants issued to Wyatts were incorrectly calculated. On March 6
 2017
 the Company issued
warrants to purchase 915
447 shares of Common Stock at $0.91 per share to Wyatts to correct for this error. There was no financial
impact resulting from this warrant understatement other than an understatement of potentially dilutive shares.



    
    


In
January 2016
 Wyatts purchased 285
715 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2016 Subscription. The purchase price of the shares
was $0.35 per share

858 shares at a price of $0.70 per share. The five year warrant is
immediately exercisable.

In
August 2015
 the Company entered into a subscription agreement (the &ldquo;2015 Subscription&rdquo;) whereby 750

Common Stock were sold to Wyatts

000
 along with a purchase warrant for 1
500
000 shares of Common Stock
at a price of $0.40 per share. The five year warrant is immediately exercisable.

On
December 8
 2015
 the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Richard Seet
 a former officer and director
 pursuant to
which the parties agreed (i) to terminate that certain Employment Agreement entered into between the Company and Seet dated October
1
 2012 and that certain Amended and Restated Restricted Stock Agreement entered into between the Company and Seet dated December
4
 2013 and all obligations set forth therein; (ii) that Seet will return stock certificates representing 1
165
251 shares of
Common Stock of the Company that would have vested upon certain revenue milestones to the Company for cancellation; (iii) the
Company will issue to Seet settlement shares of the Company which will be subject to a certain lock up legend providing that Seet
may only sell 145
656 of the settlement shares per quarter upon the Rule 144 holding period being satisfied and upon the Company
generating a minimum of $5
000
000 in revenue during any 12 month period; and (iv) Seet will provide the Company with a release
and discharge from any and all liability.

On

Director
Independence

We
are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has
requirements that a majority of the board of directors be &ldquo;independent&rdquo; and
 as a result
 we are not at this time
required to (and we do not) have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority of &ldquo;Independent Directors.&rdquo;

Our
Board of Directors has considered the independence of its directors in reference to the definition of &ldquo;independent director&rdquo;
established by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2). In doing so
 the Board of Directors has reviewed all commercial and other
relationships of each director in making its determination as to the independence of its directors. After such review
 the Board
of Directors has determined that Mr. Devlin and Mr. Kaufman qualify as independent under the requirements of the Nasdaq listing
standards.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To
the shareholders and directors of
MOJO Organics
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of MOJO Organics
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31
 2017 and 2016
the related statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity/deficit
 and cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended December 31
 2017
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;).
In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;
as of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31
 2017
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent wih respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal controls over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes
to Financial Statements
December
31
 2017 and 2016

NOTE
1 &ndash; BUSINESS 



MOJO
Organics
 Inc. (&ldquo;MOJO&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 2
 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;Headquartered
in Jersey City
 NJ
 the Company engages in new product development
 production
 marketing
 distribution and sales of beverage
brands that are natural and Non GMO Project Verified.

NOTE
2 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use
of Estimates

The
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&quot;GAAP&quot;). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash
equivalents include investment instruments and time deposits purchased with a maturity of three months or less. As of December
31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 the Company did not have any cash equivalents.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company provides for probable
uncollectible amounts based upon its assessment of the current status of the individual receivables and after using reasonable
collection efforts. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31
 2017 and 2016 was zero and $3
000 respectively.



Inventories
consisting solely of finished goods
 are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out method) or net realizable value (&ldquo;NRV&rdquo;).
When necessary
 the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventories to the lower of cost or NRV.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue
from sales of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 delivery of products has occurred
 the
sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Costs incurred for sales incentives and discounts
are accounted for as a reduction in revenue.

Deductions
from Revenue

Costs
incurred for sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction in revenue. These costs include payments to customers
for performing merchandising activities on our behalf
 including in-store displays
 promotions for new items and obtaining optimum
shelf space.


    
    


Shipping
and Handling Costs

Shipping
and Handling Costs incurred to move finished goods from our sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in the
line Selling
 General and Administrative Expenses in our Statements of Operations.

Net
Loss Per Common Share

The
Company computes per share amounts in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting
Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 260
&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;ASC Topic 260 requires
presentation of basic and diluted EPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.

The
following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of weighted average shares outstanding for the
years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
 as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact on the Company&rsquo;s net loss per common
share:

Income
Taxes

The
Company provides for income taxes using the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
if
 based on the weight of available evidence
 it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized.

The
Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31
 2017 and
December 31
 2016
 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties. The Company has had no Federal or state tax examinations
in the past nor does it have any at the current time.

Stock-Based
Compensation

ASC
Topic 718
&rdquo; prescribes accounting and reporting standards for employee
stock-based compensation plans
 including employee stock options
 restricted stock
 employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation
rights. ASC Topic 718 requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value method. The Company&nbsp;accounts
for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions&nbsp;of ASC Topic 718.

The
Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50
 &ldquo;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees.&rdquo; &nbsp;ASC Topic 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever
is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of (i) common stock issued
for payments to non-employees is measured at the market price on the date of grant; (ii) equity instruments
 other than common
stock
 is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general
 we recognize an asset or expense in the same manner
as if it is to pay cash or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.

Fair
value of financial instruments

The

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
May 2014
 FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) No. 2014-09
 which creates ASC Topic 606

from Contracts with Customers&rdquo;
 and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605

Recognition&rdquo;
 including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
In addition
 ASU 2014-09 supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35

and Production-Type Contracts
&rdquo; and creates new Subtopic 340-40

with Customers
 the core principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services
are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim
periods within that reporting period
 and early application is not permitted. Therefore the amendments in ASU 2014-09 will become
effective for us as of the beginning of our 2017 fiscal year. The The Company currently recognizes revenue as soon as delivery
of goods has occurred. The new pronouncement will not have a material impact on the financial statements.

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting standards
 if currently adopted
 would have
a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.

Stock
Warrants

In
connection with two private placement offerings in March 2014 (the &ldquo;2014 Offerings&rdquo;)
 investors received one purchase
warrant at $0.91 per share for each share of Common Stock purchased. The warrants issued to Wyatts Torch Equity Partners
 LP (&ldquo;Wyatts&rdquo;)
were incorrectly calculated. On March 6
 2017
 the Company issued warrants to purchase 915
447 shares of Common Stock at $0.91
per share to Wyatts to correct for this error. There was no financial impact resulting from this warrant understatement other
than an understatement of potentially dilutive shares.

In
connection with the February 2016 Subscription
 warrants to purchase 482
143 shares of Common Stock were issued at a price of
$0.70 per share and are exercisable for a period of two years from the date of issuance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 &amp;#8220;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.&amp;#8221; &amp;#160;ASC Topic&#13;505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration&#13;received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued

 which creates ASC Topic 606
 &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;
&#13;and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605
 &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Revenue Recognition&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;
 including most industry-specific&#13;revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition
 ASU 2014-09 supersedes the cost guidance&#13;in Subtopic 605-35
 &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Revenue Recognition&amp;#8212;Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts&lt;/i&gt;

 &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Other Assets and Deferred Costs&amp;#8212;Contracts with Customers&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;#8221; In summary
 the core&#13;principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that&#13;reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective&#13;for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within that reporting period
 and early&#13;application is not permitted. Therefore the amendments in ASU 2014-09 will become effective for us as of the beginning of our 2017&#13;fiscal year. The The Company currently recognizes revenue as soon as delivery of goods has occurred. The new pronouncement will&#13;not have a material impact on the financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=margin: 0&gt;Management does not believe that any other recently issued

the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences

 based on the weight of available evidence
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605

revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition
 ASU 2014-09 supersedes the cost guidance

 the core
principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within that reporting period
 and early
application is not permitted. Therefore the amendments in ASU 2014-09 will become effective for us as of the beginning of our 2017
fiscal year. The The Company currently recognizes revenue as soon as delivery of goods has occurred. The new pronouncement will
not have a material impact on the financial statements.

In connection
with two private placement offerings in March 2014 (the &#8220;2014 Offerings&#8221;)
 investors received one purchase warrant
at $0.91 per share for each share of Common Stock purchased. The warrants issued to Wyatts Torch Equity Partners
 LP (&#8220;Wyatts&#8221;)
were incorrectly calculated. On March 6
 2017
 the Company issued warrants to purchase 915
447 shares of Common Stock at $0.91
per share to Wyatts to correct for this error. There was no financial impact resulting from this warrant understatement other
than an understatement of potentially dilutive shares.

In connection
with the February 2016 Subscription
 warrants to purchase 482
143 shares of Common Stock were issued at a price of $0.70 per share
and are exercisable for a period of two years from the date of issuance.&#160;&#160;

Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-09

revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition

 the core
principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean.
