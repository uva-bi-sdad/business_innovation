ITEM 5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY
Our common stock trades over-the-counter and is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol &#8220;NHMD.&#8221; The table below sets forth the high and low bid prices for our common stock as reflected on the OTC Bulletin Board for the last two fiscal years. Quotations represent prices between dealers

 our stock is characterized as a &#8220;penny stock&#8221; under applicable securities regulations. Our stock therefore is subject to rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock must furnish his customer a document containing information prescribed by the SEC and obtain from the customer an executed acknowledgment of receipt of that document. The broker or dealer must also provide the customer with pricing information regarding the security prior to the transaction and with the written confirmation of the transaction. The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction and with the written confirmation of the trade. The broker or dealer must also send an account statement to each customer for which he has executed a transaction in a penny stock each month in which such security is held for the customer&#8217;s account. The existence of these rules may have an effect on the price of our stock

The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However
 the Company has negative working capital
 recurring losses
In the coming year
 the Company&#8217;s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business
 maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
Historically
 it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company&#8217;s stock or through loans from private investors
Our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis
 management evaluates its estimates and judgments
 including those related to revenue recognition
 accrued expenses
 financing operations
 and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

 the Company&#8217;s cash position is insufficient to maintain its operations at the current level for the next 12 months. Any expansion may cause the Company to require additional capital until such expansion began generating revenue. It is anticipated that the raise of additional funds will principally be through the sales of our securities. As of the date of this report

Our critical accounting policies
 including the assumptions and judgments underlying them
We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 commonly referred to as the JOBS Act. We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years
 or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion
 (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
As an &#8220;emerging growth company
&#8221; we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including
not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section&nbsp;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (we also will not be subject to the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404(b) as long as we are a &#8220;smaller reporting company
In addition
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision
 an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. In other words
 an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of such accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies until the first to occur of the date the subject company (i) is no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B). The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period and
 as a result
 our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. Accordingly
 until the date that we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B)
 upon the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to your financial statements and has a different effective date for public and private companies
In the next twelve months

 as of May 31
 2015 and 2014
 and the related statements of expenses
 changes in stockholder&#8217;s equity and cash flows for the year ended May 31
 2015 and the period from May 12
 2014 (inception) through May 31
We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatements. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of May 31
 2015 and 2014
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended 2015 and the period from May 12

 &#8220;our&#8221;
 the Company or the Registrant) was incorporated in the state of Colorado on January 12
 2000. Nate&#8217;s Food Co. is domiciled in the state of Colorado
 and its corporate headquarters are located in Huntington Beach
 California. The Company selected May 31 as its fiscal year end. On May 12
 2014
 Nate&#8217;s Pancakes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Indiana. On May 19
 2014
 the Company completed a reverse merger between with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes
 Inc.. Nate&#8217;s Pancakes was the surviving Company. In May 2014
For purposes of the statement of cash flows
The Company applies Topic 718 &#8220;Share-Based Payments&#8221; (&#8220;Topic 718&#8221;) to share-based compensation
The Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 &#8220;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees&#8221; (&#8220;Topic No. 505-50&#8221;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
It is the company&#8217;s policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 &#8220;Revenue Recognition.&#8221; Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue earning activities are recognized upon the sale and delivery of its products. As of May 31
 2015
 the Company has generated $3
996 in revenue. Consideration received prior to our delivery of the product is deferred until delivery. We had $29
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes.&#8221; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity&#8217;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence
ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
We employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition
activities related to the development of new products. Research and development expense was $105
232
 and $0 in fiscal 2015 and 2014
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
For federal income tax purposes
 depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes
During the Fiscal Year ended May 31
 2015
 the Company acquired food-processing equipment for $85
004. The equipment has a useful life of 10 years. The equipment was installed and began being used in September 2015. As such
Level 2 -&nbsp;Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from
 or corroborated by
NSL's financial instruments consist principally of cash
 accounts payable
 and accrued liabilities. Pursuant to ASC 820 and 825
 the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs
The following table sets forth by level with the fair value hierarchy the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on May 31
221
221
The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 260
. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS

We have not had any disagreements with our auditors on any matters of accounting principles

Our principal executive and principal financial officers have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a &#8211; 15(e) and 15d &#8211; 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods required under the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 as appropriate
Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management&#8217;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to Rule 308(b) of Regulation S-K
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30
 2014. Based on this assessment
 management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as a result of the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. In making this assessment
 management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 or COSO. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company's internal control system
 including (i) the control environment
 (ii) risk assessment
 (iii) control activities
 (iv) information and communication
A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency
 or combination of control deficiencies
Management identified the following material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of April 30
Ineffective controls over financial reporting: The Company intends to hire additional staff members
 either as employees or consultants
&nbsp;prior to December 31
 2015. These additional staff members will be responsible for making sure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported as and when required and will the staff members will have segregated responsibilities with regard to these responsibilities. The costs associated with the hiring the additional staff members will increase the Company's Sales
 General and Administration (SG&amp;A) Expense. It is anticipated the cost of the new staff members will be approximately $60
000 per year. As of April 30
 2015
 we have no full-time employees with the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. As a result
: After the election of the independent directors at the 2015 annual shareholder meeting
: We need to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions
 including equity transactions
 and prepare
As our resources allow
 we will add financial personnel to our management team. We plan to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions
As of April 30
 2015
 the Company has not taken any remediation actions to address these weaknesses in our controls even though they were identified during the year. The Company&#8217;s management expects
 once it is in the financial position to do so
 to hire additional staff in its accounting department to be able to segregate the duties. The Company expects that the expense will be approximately $60

 income&#13;tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences&#13;of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred&#13;tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those&#13;temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in&#13;tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is &amp;#34;more&#13;likely than not&amp;#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination

The tax benefit of a qualifying&#13;position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon&#13;ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest&#13;and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that&#13;are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties

 &amp;#34;Accounting for Income Taxes.&amp;#34; Under this method
 income&#13;tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences&#13;of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred&#13;tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those&#13;temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in&#13;tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided&#13;to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence

 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is &amp;#34;more&#13;likely than not&amp;#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying&#13;position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon&#13;ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest&#13;and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that&#13;are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties

The Company's financial statements are prepared
using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
 which contemplates
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However
 the Company has negative working
capital
 recurring losses
 and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.


going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually
attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the
Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


 the Company's foreseeable
cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business
 maintaining its good standing and making
the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business
developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.


 it has mostly relied upon internally
generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital
by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company's stock or through loans from private investors
although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company's failure to do so could have a material
and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.

Summary of significant accounting policies
of Nate's Food Co. (the &#34;Company&#34;) is presented to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. The accounting
policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have
been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are
representations of the Company's management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.


Standards Update No. 2014-10
 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements.
The adoption of this ASU allows the Company to remove the inception to date information and all references to development stage.

 the &#34;Company&#34; or the &#34;Registrant&#34;) was incorporated in the state of Colorado on January 12
2000. Nate's Food Co. is domiciled in the state of Colorado
 and its corporate headquarters are located in Huntington Beach
 California.
The Company selected May 31 as its fiscal year end. On May 12
 2014
 Nate's Pancakes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Indiana.
On May 19
 2014
 the Company completed a reverse merger between with Nate's Pancakes
 Inc.. Nate's Pancakes was the surviving Company.
In May 2014
 the Company changed its name from Capital Resource Alliance to Nate's Food Co.




the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.




accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements' estimates
or assumptions could have a material impact on Nate's Food Co. financial condition and results of operations during the period
in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Nate's Food Co.'s financial statements reflect
all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations
for the periods presented.




Payments&#34; (&#34;Topic 718&#34;) to share-based compensation
 which requires the measurement of the cost of services received
in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized
when the event occurs. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted.


with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 &#34;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees&#34; (&#34;Topic
No. 505-50&#34;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at
the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable.




gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 &#34;Revenue Recognition.&#34; Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue
earning activities are recognized upon the sale and delivery of its products. As of May 31
 2015
 the Company has generated $3
996
in revenue. Consideration received prior to our delivery of the product is deferred until delivery. We had $29
250 in deferred
revenue for a deposit from a related party. See footnote 3 for details.




of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 &#34;Accounting for Income Taxes.&#34; Under this method
 income
tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences
of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided
to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#34;more
likely than not&#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying
position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest
and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that
are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as
components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.

 and $0 in fiscal 2015 and 2014
 respectively.




Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life
of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period.

by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
(denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period
using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average
stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options

The Company analyzed the conversion option
for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815

 and hedging
 and determined that the instrument
should be classified as a liability since the conversion option becomes effective at issuance resulting in there being no explicit
limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options.


 2015
the convertible promissory note in the amount of $110
000 became convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at issuance.
The fair value of the conversion option of the unsecured convertible promissory note was determined to be $221
040 using a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model as of May 31
 2015. The Company recognized a total $111
040 as a loss on derivative related to this convertible
note. The Company calculated the liability on issuance and as of May 31
 2015. On issuance the company recognized debt discount
of $110
000
 derivative liability of $224
954 and day one loss of $114
954 related to this convertible note which was offset by
a gain of $3
914 when remeasured at May 31
 2015 to $221
040.

For purposes of the statement of cash flows
the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.




The preparation of financial statements in
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements' estimates
or assumptions could have a material impact on Nate's Food Co. financial condition and results of operations during the period
in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Nate's Food Co.'s financial statements reflect
all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations
for the periods presented.




The Company applies Topic 718 &#34;Share-Based
Payments&#34; (&#34;Topic 718&#34;) to share-based compensation
 which requires the measurement of the cost of services received
in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized
when the event occurs. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted.


with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 &#34;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees&#34; (&#34;Topic
No. 505-50&#34;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at
the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable.




It is the company's policy that revenues and
gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 &#34;Revenue Recognition.&#34; Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue
earning activities are recognized upon the sale and delivery of its products. As of May 31
 2015
 the Company has generated $3
996
in revenue. Consideration received prior to our delivery of the product is deferred until delivery. We had $29
250 in deferred
revenue for a deposit from a related party. See footnote 3 for details.




The Company uses the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 &#34;Accounting for Income Taxes.&#34; Under this method
 income
tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences
of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided
to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#34;more
likely than not&#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying
position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest
and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that
are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as
components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.




We employ processes at our principal manufacturing
locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition
we conduct research


products. Research and development expense was $105
232
 and $0 in fiscal 2015 and 2014
 respectively.




Property and equipment are carried at cost.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life
of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period.

the Company acquired food-processing equipment for $85

and began being used in September 2015. As such
 the Company will begin to deprecate it starting September 2015.

The Company computes net income (loss) per
share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;ASC&#34;) 260
&#34;. ASC 260
requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed
by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
(denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period
using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average
stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options
or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.




The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (&#34;U.S.&#160;GAAP&#34;). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since
