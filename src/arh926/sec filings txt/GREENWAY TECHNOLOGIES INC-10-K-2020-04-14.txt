We
&rdquo;)
conversion systems and micro-plants that can be scaled to meet specific gas field production requirements. Our patented and proprietary
&rdquo;)
 a unique
component used to convert natural gas into Syngas
&rdquo;) reactor
and catalyst
 produces fuels including gasoline
 diesel
 jet fuel and methanol. G-Reformer units can be deployed to process a
variety of natural gas streams including pipeline gas
 associated gas
 flared gas
 vented gas
 coal-bed methane and/or biomass
gas. When derived from any of these natural gas sources
 the liquid fuels created are incrementally cleaner than conventionally
produced oil-based fuels. Our Company&rsquo;s objective is to become a material direct and licensed producer of renewable GTL
synthesized diesel and jet fuels
 with a near -term focus on U.S. market opportunities. For more information about our Company
please visit our website located at 

Our
GTL Technology

In
August 2012
 we acquired 100% of GIE
 pursuant to that certain Purchase Agreement
 by and between us and GIE
 dated August 29
2012
 and filed as Exhibit 10.5 to this Form 10-K
&rdquo;).
GIE owns patents and trade secrets for a proprietary technology to convert natural gas into Syngas. Based on a new
 breakthrough
&rdquo;)
 we believe that the G-Reformer
 combined with conventional
FT processes
 offers an economical and scalable method to converting natural gas to liquid fuel. On February 15
 2013
 GIE filed
for its first patent on this GTL technology
 resulting in the issue of U.S. Patent 8
574
501 B1 on November 5
 2013. On November
4
 2013
 GIE filed for a second patent covering other unique aspects of the design and was issued U.S. Patent 8
795
597 B2 on
August 5
 2014. The Company has several other pending patent applications
 both domestic and international
 related to various
components and processes relating to our proprietary GTL methods
 complementing our existing portfolio of issued patents and pending
patent applications.

On
June 26
 2017
&rdquo;) announced that we had successfully demonstrated
our GTL technology at our sponsored Conrad Greer Laboratory at UTA
 proving the viability of the science behind the technology.

On
March 6
 2018
 we announced the completion of our first commercial scale G-Reformer
 a critical component in what we call the
 A team
consisting of individuals from our Company
 UTA and our Company&rsquo;s contracted G-Reformer manufacturer worked together to
test and calibrate the newly built G-Reformer unit. The testing substantiated the units&rsquo; Syngas generation capability and
demonstrated additional proficiencies within certain proprietary prior prescribed testing metrics.

On
July 23
 2019
 we announced that Mabert LLC
&rdquo;)
 controlled by Kevin
Jones
 one of our directors
 acquired INFRA Technology Group&rsquo;s U.S. GTL plant and technology located in Wharton
 Texas (the
t&rdquo;). Mabert purchased the entire 5.2-acre site
 plant and equipment
 including INFRA&rsquo;s proprietary
FT reactor system and operating license agreement.

On
August 29
 2019
 to further facilitate the commercialization process
 we announced that it entered into the joint venture
 OPM
Green Energy
 LLC
&rdquo;)
 for an ownership interest in the Wharton Plant.
The other members of OPMGE are Mabert and Tom Phillips
 Vice President of Operations for GIE. Our involvement in OPMGE is intended
to facilitate third-party certification of our G-Reformer and related equipment and technology. In addition
 we anticipate that
OPMGE&rsquo;s operations will demonstrate that the G-Reformer is a commercially viable technology for producing Syngas and marketable
fuel products. As the first operating GTL plant to use our proprietary reforming technology and equipment
 the Wharton Plant is
initially expected to yield a minimum of 75 - 100 barrels per day of gasoline and diesel fuels from converted natural gas.


    
    


Ultimately
we believe that our proprietary G-Reformer is a major innovation in gas reforming and GTL technology in general. Initial tests
have demonstrated that our Company&rsquo;s solution appears to be superior to legacy technologies
 which are more costly
 have
a larger footprint
 and cannot be easily deployed at field sites to process associated gas
 stranded gas
 coal-bed methane
 vented
gas
 or flared gas. In addition
 the Wharton Plant is anticipated to prove out the economics for the Company&rsquo;s technology
and GTL processes.

The
technology for the G-Reformer is unique
 because it permits for transportable (mobile) GTL plants with much smaller footprints
compared to legacy large-scale technologies. Thus
 we believe that our technologies and processes will allow for multiple small-scale
GTL plants to be built with substantially lower up-front and ongoing costs
 resulting in more profitable results for oil and gas
operators

GTL
Industry &ndash;Market

GTL
converts natural gas &ndash; the cleanest-burning fossil fuel &ndash; into high-quality liquid products that would otherwise be
made from crude oil. These products include transport fuels
 motor oils
 and the ingredients for everyday necessities like plastics
detergents
 and cosmetics. GTL products are colorless
 odorless
 and contain almost none of the impurities
 (e.g.
 sulphur
 aromatics
and nitrogen) that are found in crude oil.

According
to publicly available industry research from Shell Oil
 MarketResearcEngine.com
 among others
 the market for GTL products is
said to have accounted for approximately $11.9 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $20.1billion by 2023
 growing at a compound
annual growth rate of 11.03% over that period. Products created by the GTL process include GTL Diesel
 GTL Naphtha
 GTL Other
(e.g.
 lubricants)
 with GTL Diesel accounting for more than 68% of the product market. Market share of these products has not
changed significantly over the last four years. Increasing population across the globe have led to an increase in power consumption
&rdquo;). In the commercial sector
 there has
been generally high demand for NGL products among petrochemical plants and refineries for blendstock
 i.e.
 a blend of unfinished
oils that creates a refined product
 as well as in the automotive and packaging industries
 among others. Due to their relatively
clean burning nature
 NGL products may be used as fuel in motor vehicles
 in furnaces for heating and cooking and household energy
source. Our planned focus is in technology licensing for our GTL plant technology
 and in some cases
 the direct production and
sale of high cetane diesel and jet fuels
 a multi-billion-dollar market segment.

Development
of stringent environmental regulations by numerous governments to control pollution and promote cleaner fuel sources is expected
to complement industry growth. For example
 we believe that U.S. guidelines such as the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board
Act
 2006
 Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act of 1948
 and Oil Industry (Development) Act
 1974 are likely to continue
to encourage GTL applications in diverse end-use industries to conserve natural gas and other resources. Under the Clean Air Act
(CAA)
 the EPA sets limits on certain air pollutants
 including setting limits on how much can be in the air anywhere in the United
States. The Clean Air Act also gives EPA the authority to limit emissions of air pollutants coming from sources like chemical
plants
 refineries
 utilities
 and steel mills. Individual states or tribes may have stronger air pollution laws
 but they may
not have weaker pollution limits than those set by EPA. Because our G-Reformer based GTL plants are not considered refineries
they do not fall under any related current EPA air quality guidelines. More information can be found under the EPA&rsquo;s New
Source Performance Standards which are published under 40 CFR 60.



Key
industry players include: Chevron Corporation; KBR Inc
 PetroSA
 Qatar Petroleum
 Royal Dutch Shell; and Sasol Limited. In terms
of global production and consumption
 Shell had the largest market share in 2019
 with virtually all current production located
overseas. Our technology is not designed to compete with the large refinery-size GTL plants operated by such large industry operators.
Our plants are designed to be scaled to meet individual gas field production requirements on a distributed and mobile basis. According
to a report released in July 2019 by the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (&ldquo;GGFRP&rdquo;)
 there are currently only
5 small-scale GTL plant technologies that have been proven and are now available for gas flares monetization available in the
U.S.
 including: Greyrock (&ldquo;Flare to Fuels&rdquo;); Advantage Midstream (licensing Greyrock technology); EFT (&ldquo;Flare
Buster&rdquo;); Primus GE and GasTechno (&ldquo;Methanol in a Box&rdquo;). We were not a direct part of this study
 as we had
not received 3rd party certification of our proprietary technology as of the date of this report.

However
the GGFRP report mentioned us as follows
 &ldquo;Greenway Technologies announced on July 23 that Mabert LLC
 a major investor
in Greenway
 acquired the whole INFRA plant including an operating license agreement. The purpose of the acquisition is the incorporation
and commercial demonstration of Greenway&rsquo;s &lsquo;G-Reformer&rsquo; technology. We will see whether the new team will be
able to make the plant with the new reformer operational. (Globe Newswire

Mining
Interests

In
December 2010
 UMED acquired the rights to approximately 1
440 acres of placer mining claims located on Bureau of Land Management
&rdquo;) land in Mohave County
 Arizona (such property
&rdquo;)
 in an Assignment
Agreement dated December 27
 2010
 and filed as Exhibit 10.31 to this Form 10-K
 between Melek Mining
 Inc.
 4HM Partners
 Inc.
and the Company
 in exchange for 5
066
000 shares of our common stock. Early indications from samples taken and processed by Melek
Mining provided reason to believe that the potential recovery value of the metals located on the Arizona Property could be significant
but only actual mining and processing will determine the ultimate value that may be realized from this property holding. While
we are not currently conducting mining operations
 we are exploring strategic options to partner or sell our interest in the Arizona
Property
 while we focus on our emerging GTL technology sales and marketing efforts.

Company
History

We
&rdquo;) under the laws of the State
of Texas on March 13
&rdquo;)
 a Nevada
corporation
 on August 17
 2009
 we changed our name to UMC. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger
 and UMC was
the acquiring company on the basis that UMC&rsquo;s senior management became the entire senior management of the merged entity
and there was a change of control of Dynalyst. The transaction was accounted for as recapitalization of Dynalyst&rsquo;s capital
structure. In connection with the merger
 Dynalyst issued 57
500
000 restricted equity securities to the shareholders of UMC in
exchange for 100% of UMC.

On
March 23
 2011
 Universal Media Corporation approved and filed with the Texas Secretary of State an amendment to our Certificate
to change our name to UMED Holdings
 Inc.

On
June 22
 2017
 in recognition of our primary operational activity
 we approved an amendment to our Certificate to change our name
to &ldquo;Greenway Technologies Inc.&rdquo; We filed a certificate of amendment with the Texas Secretary of State to affect that
name change on June 23
 2017.

On
June 26
 2019
 we held our annual shareholders meeting in Arlington
 Texas. There were seven proposals presented for vote by our
&rdquo;)
 including to approve the Company&rsquo;s slate of directors
 to amend our
Certificate
 to amend our bylaws
 and to ratify our then current independent public accounting audit firm. We disclosed the results
of the vote of the Shareholders on our Current Report Form 8-K
 filed with the SEC on July 2
 2019
 which is incorporated herein
by reference. On August 1
 2019
 we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K/A
 noting that due to a potential tabulation error
 we
were reviewing the results for Proposal 2
 which was to amend our Company&rsquo;s Certificate to increase the authorized shares
of capital stock of the Company and Proposal 3
 which was to amend the Company&rsquo;s Certificate to permit the vote of the holders
of the majority of shares entitled to vote on and represented in person or by proxy at a meeting of the Shareholders at which
a quorum is present
 to be the action of the Shareholders
 including for &ldquo;fundamental actions
&rdquo; as such term is defined
&rdquo;) . To resolve any such potential errors
 we called a special
meeting of the Shareholders to be held December 11
 2019
 in Arlington
 Texas.

On
December 11
 2019
 we held a special meeting of the Shareholders to approve four proposals. In connection with these four proposals
we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas
 which is attached as
Exhibit 3.1 to our Company&rsquo;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 16
 2019
 and incorporated herein
by reference. All four proposals passed overwhelmingly. For more information regarding these proposals
 please see our Definitive
Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on November 19
 2019 and incorporated herein by reference.



As
of the filing date of this Form 10-K
 we have five (5) full-time employees. Certain of these employees receive no compensation
or compensation is deferred on a periodic basis by mutual agreement. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.


    
    


Going
Concern

The
&rdquo;) have
been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. As of December 31
 2019
 we have an accumulated deficit of $30
479
829. For the year ended December 31
 2019
we incurred a net loss of $3
661
245 and used $1
332
528 in net cash for operating activities. As a pre-revenue entity
 these
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. While we are attempting to commence
revenue generating operations and thereby generate sustainable revenues
 our current cash position is not sufficient to support
our ongoing daily operations and requires us to raise addition capital through debt and/or equity sources.

Accordingly
our ability to continue as a going concern is therefore in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations
or on our ability to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way
of public or private offerings
 or both. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to implement our business
plan to generate revenues will provide us the opportunity to continue as a going concern.

While
we are attempting to commence operations and generate revenues
 our cash position may not be enough to support our daily operations.
Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently
being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going
concern. While management believes in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional
funds
 there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to
further implement our business plan and generate revenues.



    
    


Risks
Related to our Business and Operations

We
may not be able to raise the additional capital necessary to execute our business strategy
 which includes the production
 sale
and/or licensing of our proprietary GTL technology solutions to oil and gas operators in the United States and elsewhere.

Our
ability to successfully execute the production
 sale
 or licensing of our GTL technology may depend on our ability to raise additional
debt or equity capital. Our ability to raise additional capital is uncertain and dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control
including
 but not limited to
 general economic conditions
 regulatory factors
 reduced retail sales
 increased taxation
 reductions
in consumer confidence
 changes in levels of consumer spending
 changes in preferences in how consumers pay for goods and services
weak housing markets and availability or lack of availability of credit. If we are unable to obtain additional capital
 or if
the terms thereof are too costly
 we may be unable to successfully execute our business strategy.

Our
limited operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations.

We
are a development-stage company and have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. We
have yet to develop sufficient experience regarding actual revenues to be received from our GTL technology. You must consider
the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in new and evolving markets. If we are unsuccessful
in addressing these risks and uncertainties
 our business
 results of operations
 and financial condition will be materially and
adversely affected. The risks and difficulties we face include challenges in accurate financial planning as a result of limited
historical data and the uncertainties resulting from a relatively limited period in which to implement and evaluate our business
strategies as compared to older companies with longer operating histories.

We
have historically incurred losses.

We
are considered a pre-revenue or development stage company. We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Due
to the inherent risk of commercializing new technology
 there can be no assurance that we will earn net income in the future.
We may require additional capital in order to fund our operations
 which it may not be able to source on acceptable terms.


    
    


Establishing
revenues and achieving profitability will depend on our ability to fully develop
 certify and commercialize our GTL Technology
including successfully marketing our GTL Technology to our customers and complying with possible regulations.

Much
of our ability to establish revenues
 achieve profitability and create positive cash flows from operations will depend on the
completion of third-party engineering certification and subsequent successful introduction of our proprietary GTL technology.
Our prospective customers will not use our GTL technology unless they determine that the economic benefits provided by our GTL
solution is greater than those available from competing technologies and providers. Even if the advantages derived from our proprietary
GTL technology are well-established
 prospective customers may elect not to use our GTL technology.

In
addition
 as this is a new technology and GTL processing method
 we may be required to undertake time-consuming and costly additional
development activities and seek regulatory clearance or approval for such new GTL technology. Such costs are not known by us as
of the date of this report.

Lastly
the completion of the development and commercialization of our GTL technology remains subject to all the risks associated with
the commercialization of any new GTL processing system with production based on innovative technologies
 including unanticipated
technical or other problems
 manufacturing difficulties
 and the possible insufficiency of the funds allocated for the completion
of such development.

We
may encounter substantial competition in our industry and a failure to compete effectively may adversely affect our ability to
generate revenue.

We
expect that we will be required to continue to invest in product development and efficiency improvements to compete effectively
in our markets. Our competitors could potentially develop a similar or more efficient GTL product or undertake more aggressive
and costly marketing campaigns than ours
 which may adversely affect our sales and marketing strategies and could have a material
adverse effect on our business
 results of operations
 and financial condition. Important factors affecting our ability to compete
successfully include:



    
    
current
    and future direct sales and marketing efforts by small and large competitors;

    
    
rapid and effective
    development of new
 unique GTL techniques; and

    
    
new and aggressive
    pricing methodologies


If
substantial competitors enter our targeted markets
 such as licensing of smaller independent oil and gas operators or the creation
of blendstock for existing large refinery operations
 we may be unable to compete successfully against such competition. Our potential
competitors may have greater human and financial resources than we do at any given time
 and there is significant competition
for experienced personnel and financial capital in the oil and gas industry. Therefore
 it can be difficult for smaller companies
such as ours to attract the personnel and related investment for our various business activities needed to succeed. We cannot
give any assurances that we will be able to successfully compete for such personnel and capital funds. Without adequate financial
resources
 our management cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in our operations.

The
longevity of patents in the United Sates is limited in duration and may affect the Company&rsquo;s long-term ability to successfully
monetize the intellectual property it owns.

August 5
 2014
 covering our GTL conversion technology for the purpose of converting natural gas to clean synthetic fuels in a
small-plant and mobile application. The term of each patent under U.S. law is 21 years. Accordingly
 each of these patents will
expire in the years 2034 and 2035 respectively
 unless they are modified with &ldquo;improvements to the current art&rdquo; by
us
 in which case their useful lives may be extended. There is no certainty that we will be able to make such improvements to
our currently held patents
 and they therefore may expire at their respective terms. Alternatively
 a patent&rsquo;s term may
be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed (litigated) over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor
has an earlier expiration date. There is no certainty that we will be able to successfully defend our patents if such claims are
made
 and they may expire prior to their respective terms.


    
    


We
are currently dependent on one equipment fabricator
 the loss of which could adversely impact our operations.

We
contract our manufacturing production with a heavy equipment fabricator in Texas that has worked with us for several years and
specializes in the type of base refractory equipment we use in our proprietary G-Reformer based GTL processes. Accordingly
 they
have developed certain manufacturing expertise specifically related to our equipment which may be hard to replicate with a new
manufacturer if they go out-of-business or end manufacturing for us for any reason. While there are similar manufacturers elsewhere
in the United States and overseas
 they will take an unknown additional amount of time to gain the expertise necessary to produce
our proprietary refractory equipment
 or may not be able to gain such expertise at all
 limiting our production and related revenue
capability.

We
are dependent on a limited number of key executives
 consultants
 the loss of any of which could negatively impact our business.

Our
business is led by an interim President
 Kent Harer
 and our Chief Financial Officer
 Ransom Jones
 both of whom are also members
&rdquo;). Our engineering efforts are led by Thomas Phillips
 who
is also Vice President of Operations for GIE
 but we use outside consultants to support and perform the majority of the engineering
and production work on our GTL technology. We have also contracted with consultants to provide financial reporting and governance
support.

If
one or more of these senior executives
 officers
 or consultants are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions
we may not be able to replace them easily or at all
 and our business may be disrupted
 along with our financial condition
 such
that our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition
 if the competition for senior management
and senior officers in our industry is intense
 the pool of qualified candidates is limited
 and we may not be able to retain
the services of our senior executives
 key personnel
 or consultants or attract and retain high-quality personnel in the future.
Such failure could materially and adversely affect our future growth and financial condition
 and the loss of one or more of these
key personnel could negatively impact our business and operations.

If
our research and development agreements with UTA are terminated
 we may lose access to certain of the scientists that were instrumental
in developing our technology.

To
support our engineering efforts
 we entered into a confidential Sponsored Research Agreement (&ldquo;SRA&rdquo;) with UTA starting
in October 2009 and continuing in various forms through today
 adding confidential Scope of Work addendums over this period to
develop and enhance our patented GTL system with the goal of developing commercial GTL plants to convert natural gas into liquid
fuels. We use UTA as an external research and development arm for the Company. If we or UTA were to terminate our relationship
we might lose access to the scientists most familiar with our unique technology. There is no assurance that we would be able to
continue to improve on the technology we have developed thus far
 potentially slowing down our commercialization and financing
efforts.

Our
quarterly results may fluctuate substantially and if we fail to meet the expectations of our investors or analysts
 our stock
price could decline substantially.

Our
quarterly operating results may fluctuate
 and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors
the trading price of our Common Stock could decline. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenue and operating
results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:



    
    
our
    limited operating history;

    
    
    

    
    
the limited scope
    of our sales and marketing efforts;

    
    
    

    
    
our ability to attract
    new customers
 satisfy our customers&rsquo; requirements
 and retain customers;

    
    
    

    
    
general economic
    conditions;

    
    
    

    
    
changes in our pricing
    capabilities;

    
    
    

    
    
our ability to expand
    our business and operations by staying current with the evolving requirements of our target market;

    
    
    

    
    
the effectiveness
    of our key personnel;

    
    
    

    
    
our ability to protect
    our proprietary GTL Technology;

    
    
    

    
    
new
    and enhanced products by us and our competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
unanticipated delays
    or cost increases with respect to research and development; and

    
    
    

    
    
extraordinary expenses
    such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.



    
    



We
may have difficulty in attracting and retaining outside independent directors to our Board of Directors as a result of their concerns
relating to potentially increased personal exposure to lawsuits and shareholder claims by virtue of holding those positions.

The
directors and management of companies are increasingly concerned with the extent of their personal exposure to lawsuits and shareholder
claims
 as well as governmental and creditor claims that may be made against them
 particularly in view of recent changes in securities
laws imposing additional duties
 obligations
 and liabilities on management and directors. Due to these perceived risks
 directors
and management are also becoming increasingly concerned with the availability of directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability
insurance to timely pay the costs incurred in defending such claims. We currently carry directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability
insurance
 but directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance has recently become much more expensive and difficult
to obtain. If we are unable to continue or provide liability insurance at affordable rates or at all
 it may become increasingly
more difficult to attract and retain qualified outside directors to serve on our board of directors.

We
may lose potential independent board members and management candidates to other companies that have greater directors&rsquo; and
officers&rsquo; liability insurance to insure them from liability or to companies that have revenues or have received greater
funding to date which can offer more lucrative compensation packages. The fees of directors are also rising in response to their
increased duties
 obligations and liabilities as well as increased exposure to such risks. As a company with limited operating
history and resources
 we will have a more difficult time attracting and retaining management and outside independent directors
than a more established company due to these enhanced duties
 obligations and liabilities.

Our
future success relies upon our proprietary GTL Technology. We may not have the resources to enforce our proprietary rights through
litigation or otherwise. The loss of exclusive right to our GTL Technology could have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition and results of operations.

We
believe that our GTL technology does not infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of others. Even so
 third parties
may still assert infringement claims against us. If infringement claims are brought against us
 we may not have the financial
resources to defend against such claims or prevent an adverse judgment against us. In the event of an unfavorable ruling on any
such claim
 a license or similar agreement to utilize the intellectual property rights related to the GTL technology in question
which we rely on in the conduct of our business
 may not be available to us on reasonable terms
 if terms are offered at all.

Our
ability to obtain field-related operating hazards insurance may be constrained by our limited operational history.

The
oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks
 including the risk of fire
 explosions
 blow-outs
 pipe failure
abnormally-pressured formations
 and environmental hazards such as oil spills
 natural gas leaks
 ruptures or discharges of toxic
gases. If any of these events should occur at our joint venture plant location
 or at any future customer sites (none exist today)
we could incur legal defense costs and could suffer substantial losses due to injury or loss of life
 severe damage to or destruction
of property
 natural resources and equipment
 pollution or other environmental damage
 clean-up responsibilities
 regulatory investigation
and penalties
 and suspension of operations. Such inability to defend ourselves or suffer catastrophic financial losses could
cause us to cease operations and/or declare bankruptcy.

Our
JV partner
 OPMGE carries General Liability and Premises insurance. In the event we should have operations on future customer
sites
 we plan to carry comprehensive general liability insurance will further provide workers&rsquo; compensation insurance coverage
to employees in all states in which we will operate. While these policies are customary in the industry
 they do not provide complete
coverage against all operating risks
 and as a small operator
 we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage. In addition
our insurance may not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. A loss not fully covered by insurance
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position
 results of operations and cash flows
 causing us to cease business
operations. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover every claim made against us or may not be commercially available
for purchase in the future.


    
    


Our
GTL Technology is subject to the changing of applicable U.S. laws and regulations.

Our
business is particularly subject to federal and state laws and regulations with respect to the oil and gas and mining industries.
Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate
 navigate and respond to any changes that might occur. Due to our currently
limited financial resources
 we might not be able to respond to unanticipated changes
 should they occur and impact our operations
and therefore have to cease operations.

Acts
of terrorism
 responses to acts of terrorism and acts of war may impact our business and our ability to raise capital.

Future
acts of war or terrorism
 national or international responses to such acts
 and measures taken to prevent such acts may harm our
ability to raise capital or our ability to operate
 especially to the extent we depend upon activities conducted in foreign countries.
In addition
 the threat of future terrorist acts or acts of war may have effects on the general economy or on our business that
are difficult to predict. We are not insured against damage or interruption of our business caused by terrorist acts or acts of
war
 and thus
 our financial operations may be materially impacted by such events.

The
massive and currently unknown short- and long-term economic impacts of COVID-19 may impact our business and ability to raise capital.

COVID-19
and its current extraordinary impact on the world economy has reduced oil consumption globally
 decreasing crude oil prices
 to
levels not seen since the early 1980&rsquo;s. The economics of GTL conversion rely in part on the arbitrage between oil and natural
gas prices
 with economic models for many producers
 including our own models
 using a range of $30-60/bbl (for WTI or Brent Crude
as listed daily on the Nymex and ICE commodities exchanges) to determine relative profitability of their GTL operations. While
COVID-19 may run its human course in the near term
 we believe as many others in the U.S. government and media believe
 that the
economic impacts will be long lasting and for all practical matters
 remain largely unknown at this time.

We
may fail to establish and maintain strategic relationships.

We
believe that establishing strategic industry partnerships and natural gas producer customer relationships will greatly benefit
the growth of our business and the deployment of our GTL technology. To further such relationships
 we have and will continue
to seek out and enter into strategic alliances
 joint ventures
 and similar production relationships
 including similar to those
announced during the 2019 with INFRA Technologies
 OPMGE and the ongoing relationship with UTA. We continue to seek out and have
discussions with potential gas producer on both a customer and financing basis. However
 we may not be able to maintain our current
or enter into new strategic partnerships on commercially reasonable terms
 or at all
 and may not be able to create financial
or customer relationships with natural gas producers. Even if we enter new natural gas producer relationships
 such financial
partners and/or customers may not have sufficient production of location based natural gas to provide profitable revenues or otherwise
prove advantageous to our business. Our inability to enter into such new relationships or strategic alliances could have a material
and adverse effect on our business.

Risks
Relating to Our Mining Properties

There
is very limited risk
 financial or otherwise
 related to our mining leases and interests at this time.

Risks
Relating to Our Common Stock

We
may need to raise additional capital. If we are unable to raise additional capital
 our business may fail
 or our operating results
and our share price may be materially adversely affected.

Because
we have no record of profitable operations
 we need to secure adequate funding on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to obtain
adequate funding
 we may not be able to successfully develop and market our GTL technology and our business will likely fail.
We have limited commitments for financing. To secure additional financing
 we may need to borrow money or sell more securities
which may reduce the value of our outstanding securities. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms
or at all.


    
    


Selling
additional shares of Common Stock
 either privately or publicly
 would dilute the equity interests of our Shareholders. If we
borrow money
 we will have to pay interest and may also have to agree to restrictions that limit our operating flexibility. If
we are unable to obtain adequate financing
 we may have to curtail business operations
 which would have a material negative effect
on operating results and most likely result in a lower price per share of Common Stock.

Issuance
of additional Common Stock in exchange for services or to repay debt would dilute Shareholders&rsquo; proportionate ownership
and voting rights and could have a negative impact on the market price of our Common Stock.

Our
Board of Directors has previously and may continue to issue shares of our Common Stock to pay for debt or services rendered
 without
further approval by our Shareholders
 based upon such factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant in its sole discretion.
It is likely that that we will issue additional securities to pay for services and reduce debt in the future. Such issuances may
lower the market price of our stock and decrease our ability to raise additional equity funding for working or investment capital
as may be needed at a later time.

Even
though our shares of Common Stock are publicly traded
 an investor&rsquo;s shares may not be &ldquo;free-trading&rdquo; and investors
may be unable to sell their shares of Common Stock at or above their purchase price
 which may result in substantial losses to
the investor.

Investors
should understand that their shares of our Common Stock are not &ldquo;free-trading&rdquo; merely because we are a publicly traded
company. Shares bought from the Company or received for services rendered or in conjunction with the issuance of debt require
different holding periods
 thereby creating a potential lack of liquidity and inability to sell such shares timely for any investor.
In order for our shares of Common Stock to become &ldquo;free-trading
&rdquo; the offer and sale of shares of our Common Stock
must either be registered pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933

Act
 or be entitled to an exemption from registration under federal and state securities laws
 after being held for
statutory mandated periods.

In
addition
 an investor has no assurance that our stock price will rise after purchase or receipt in any manner
 as our stock has
shown significant volatility over the life of the Company. The following factors may add to the volatility in the price of our
Common Stock in the future: (i) actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; (ii) government
regulations; (iii) announcements of significant acquisitions
 strategic partnerships or joint ventures; (iv) our capital commitments;
(v) additional dilutive stock issuances
 and (vi) additions or departures of key personnel. Many of these factors are beyond our
control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock
 regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions
or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our Common Stock will be at any time
 including as to whether our Common
Stock will sustain the current market price
 or as to what effect the sale of shares of Common Stock or the availability of shares
of Common Stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.

If
we fail to remain current in our reporting requirements
 we could be removed from the OTCQB marketplace
 operated by the OTC Markets
Group
 Inc. (the &ldquo;OTCMG&rdquo;)
 which would limit the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability
of Shareholders to easily sell their securities in the secondary market.

Companies
trading on the OTCQB must: (i) be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Exchange Act of 1934

Act
to maintain electronic price quotation privileges on the OTCQB. If we fail to remain current in our Exchange Act reporting requirements
we could be removed from the OTCQB and be forced to be traded on the Pink Sheets
 which requires a more challenging stock purchase
process. The OTCQB is recognized by the SEC as an established public market. This platform enables companies to provide current
public information that investors use to analyze
 value and trade a security. The OTC Pink Sheets is the lowest and most speculative
tier of the three marketplaces for the trading of over-the-counter stocks. Companies traded on OTC Pink are not held to any particular
disclosure requirements or financial standards
 and due to the wide variety of companies listed on OTC Pink
 including dark companies
delinquent companies and worse
 they recommend only sophisticated investors with a high risk tolerance should consider it.

Pink
Sheet shares generally trade thinly and infrequently making it hard to buy or sell when the investor wants to complete a transaction.
In addition
 trading in OTC Pink Sheet companies requires more paperwork because due the speculative nature of such stocks
 the
U.S. Congress prohibited broker-dealers from effecting transactions in penny stocks unless they comply with the requirements of
Section 15(h) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder.


    
    


These
SEC rules provide
 among other things
 that a broker-dealer must: (i) approve the customer for the specific penny stock transaction
and receive from the customer a written agreement to the transaction; (ii) furnish the customer a disclosure document describing
the risks of investing in penny stocks; (iii) disclose to the customer the current market quotation
 if any
 for the penny stock;
and (iv) disclose to the customer the amount of compensation the firm and its broker will receive for the trade. In addition
after executing the sale
 a broker-dealer must send to its customer monthly account statements showing the market value of each
penny stock held in the customer&rsquo;s account. With the added inconvenience and cost for brokers
 various large brokerage firms
including Merrill Lynch
 Capital One
 Fidelity
 E-Trade and even the new Robinhood
 among others
 have simply stopped providing
brokerage services for Pink Sheet stocks for new customers. Accordingly
 the market for our common stock would be significantly
diminished if we were forced to trade on the OTC Pink Sheets market exchange.

Volatility
in the share price for our Common Stock may subject us to securities litigation.

There
is a limited market for the sale of shares of our Common Stock. The market for our Common Stock is characterized by significant
price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers
 and we expect that our Common Stock share prices will be more volatile than
a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past
 plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against
a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. In the future
 we may be the target of similar
litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management&rsquo;s attention
and resources away from our daily operations
 negatively impacting our financial results.

We
do not intend to pay dividends on shares of our Common Stock.

We
have not paid any cash dividends on shares of our Common Stock since our inception and we do not anticipate that we will pay any
cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Earnings
 if any
 that we may realize will be retained in the business for further development
and expansion. Furthermore
 our ability to pay dividends may be restricted under our debt agreements.

Our
substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.

We
have a substantial amount of indebtedness
 which requires significant interest payments. As of December 31
 2019
 we had $4
653
532
of total accrued current liabilities and $2
139
843 of current debt (net of debt discounts totaling $107
880)
 bearing an average
cash interest of 17.8% per year when current and 18% default interest when any such loans are not current. As of the date of this
Form 10-K
 we are in default of loans totaling $166
667 and have a total $2
139
843 of current debt bearing an average interest
rate of 17.8% per year. We also have additional long-term liabilities of $525
000
 in the form of a 3-year interest-only note
payable

 please see Notes 5 and 6 on pages F-11 and F-12 of our Financial
Statements.

Our
substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences
 including the following:



    
    
We must use a substantial
    portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest
 which reduces funds available to use for other purposes
 such as
    working capital
 capital expenditures
 and other general corporate purposes;

    
    
Our ability to refinance such indebtedness or
    to obtain additional financing for working capital
 capital expenditures
 acquisitions
 or general corporate purposes may
    be impacted; and

    
    
Our leverage may
    be greater than that of some of our competitors
 which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility
    in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions.


Our
ability to meet expenses and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of our debt
 depends on
 among other things
our future operating performance
 competitive developments and financial market conditions. We are not able to control many of
these factors. If industry and economic conditions deteriorate
 our ability to raise debt or equity capital and/or cash flow may
be insufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations
 which could cause us to
default on these obligations. In particular
 the Mabert loans maintain a UCC-1 security interest in all of the collateral of the
Company
 including to our G-Reformer
 technology and intellectual property (our patents
 patents pending and licensed patents).
If Mabert exercises its rights and remedies due to defaults under our secured loan agreements
 our business
 financial condition
and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.


    
    


The
market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse.

Stockholders
should be aware that
 according to SEC Release No. 34-29093
 the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns
of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:



    
    
Control
    of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;

    
    
    

    
    
Manipulation of
    prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;

    
    
    

    
    
Boiler room practices
    involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons;

    
    
    

    
    
Excessive and undisclosed
    bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and

    
    
    

    
    
The wholesale dumping
    of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level
 along with the
    resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequential investor losses.


Management
is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position
to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the penny stock market
 the Company&rsquo;s management
will strive to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities
 as the occurrence of these
patterns or practices could increase the volatility of the price per share of our Common Stock and/or diminish stockholders ability
to trade our Common Stock.

Failure
to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material
adverse effect on our business and stock price.

Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting
as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over
financial reporting in our annual report. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls
 we may not be able to
ensure that we can conclude
 on an ongoing basis
 that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

While
we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective controls over financial reporting
 failure
to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market&rsquo;s perception
of our business and the price of our Common Stock.

Our
principal office is 1521 North Cooper St.
 Suite 205
 Arlington
 Texas 76011
 leased at a rate of $957.00 per month
 plus the
cost of utilities
 which is generally less than $100.00 per month. We believe these facilities are adequate for at least the next
12 months. We expect that we could locate to other suitable facilities at comparable rates
 should we need more or less space.

We
have unpatented mining claims for the Arizona Property. An unpatented mining claim is one that is still owned by the federal government
but which the claimant has a right to possession to extracted minerals
 provided the land is open to mineral entry. A description
of the Arizona Property is included in &ldquo;Item 1. Business&rdquo; and is incorporated herein by reference. We believe that
we have satisfactory title to the Arizona Property
 subject to liens for taxes not yet payable
 liens incident to minor encumbrances
liens for credit arrangements and easements and restrictions that do not materially detract from the value of these properties
our interests in these properties
 or the use of these properties in a business. We believe that the Arizona Property is adequate
and suitable for the conduct of a mining business
 should we decide to proceed with such operations in the future.

The
Company was named as a co-defendant in an action brought against the Company and Mamaki Tea
 Inc.
 alleging
 among other things
that the Company was named as a co-guarantor on an $850
000 foreclosed note
 including accrued and accruing interest
 held by
Southwest Capital Funding
&rdquo;). On April 22
 2016
 Greenway Technologies filed suit under Cause
No. DC-16-004718
 in the 193rd District Court
 Dallas County
 Texas against Mamaki of Hawaii
 Inc. (&ldquo;Mamaki&rdquo;)
 Hawaiian
Beverages
 Inc.(&ldquo;HBI&rdquo;)
 Curtis Borman and Lee Jenison for breach of a Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 29
 2015
wherein the Company sold its shares in Mamaki to HBI for $700
000 (along with the assumption of certain debt). The Company maintained
its guaranty on the original loan as a component of the sale transaction. The Defendants failed to make payments of $150
000 each
on November 30
 2015
 December 28
 2015 and January 27
 2016. On January 13
 2017
 the parties executed a Settlement and Mutual
Release Agreement (Agreement). However
 the Defendants again defaulted in their payment obligations under this new Agreement.
Curtis Borman and Lee Jennison were co-guarantors of the obligations of Mamaki and HBI. To secure their guaranties
 each of Curtis
Borman and Lee Jennsion posted 1
241
500 and 1
000
000 shares
 respectively
 of the Company. Under the Agreement
 the shares were
valued at $.20. Due to the default under the Agreement
 these shares were returned to the Company&rsquo;s treasury shares. Curtis
Borman subsequently filed for bankruptcy and the property was liquidated for $600
000
 applied against the prior loan amount
leaving a remaining guaranteed loan payment balance of approximately $700
000
 including accrued interest and legal fees. On September
26
 2019
 we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Southwest
 providing 1
000
000 shares of Common Stock subject to standard
Rule 144 restrictions
 and a three (3) year term Promissory Note for $525
000 to settle all claims (recorded in Long Term Liabilities).
Copies of the Settlement Agreement and Promissory Note were filed by the Company on Form 8-K on October 1
 2019
 and a copy of
which is incorporated herein as Exhibit 10.54.

On
April 9
 2018
 the Company and Tonaquint
&rdquo;)agreed to settle on Tonaquint&rsquo;s exercise
of a warrant option with a one-time issuance from Greenway Technologies of 1
600
000 shares of our common stock subject to a weekly
leak out restriction equal to the greater of $10
000.00 and 8% of the weekly trading volume. Such issuance of stock was completed
in connection with a legal opinion pursuant to Rule 144. Copies of the Settlement Agreement was filed by the Company on Form 8-K
on April 9
 2018
 and a copy of which is incorporated herein as Exhibit 10.38.

On
September 7
 2018
 Wildcat Consulting Group
&rdquo;)
 a company controlled by a shareholder
 Marshall
&rdquo;)
 filed suit against the Company
 alleging claims arising from a prior consulting agreement
between the parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&rsquo;s fees. On September 27
 2018
Wildcat filed a second suit against the Company alleging claims arising from a Promissory Note between the parties
 seeking to
recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&rsquo;s fees. On February 13
 2019
 the parties attended mediation
which resulted in settlement discussions which resulted in a Rule 11 Agreement settling both disputes. Pursuant to the Rule 11
Agreement
 the parties agreed to abate both cases until the earlier of a default of the performance of the Rule 11 Agreement or
October 30
 2019. The Rule 11 Agreement was drafted to allow the Parties time to draft and sign a Compromise Settlement and Mutual
&rdquo;)
 to make payments due on or before October 15
 2019
 and
to allow for the transfer of stock to effectuate the terms of the Rule 11 Agreement. The material terms of the Rule 11 Agreement
were as follows:



    
    
The Company agreed
    to execute a new Promissory Note to replace the original Promissory Note
 effective November 13
 2017
 the effective date
    of the original note. The new Promissory Note has a maturity date of March 1

 thereby extinguishing such Promissory Note. 

    
    
    

    
    
The Company agreed
    to pay $300
000 in settlement of the prior Consulting Agreement in 60 installments of $5
000 each month
 until paid in full.
    The $300

The Parties agreed
    to amend the existing Overriding Royalty Agreement (&ldquo;ORRI&rdquo;) between the Company&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary
    Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc. (&ldquo;GIE&rdquo;)
 increasing Wildcat&rsquo;s royalties from .25% (1/4 of 1%) to .375%
    (3/8 of 1%).

    
    
    

    
    
The Company agreed
    to pay Wildcat&rsquo;s legal fees related to these matters
 capped at $60
000
 in three installments of $20
000 on June 1
    August 1
 and October 1
 2019
 all such payments having been made in the period ending December 31
 2019.

    
    
    

    
    
The Company agreed
    to issue 1
500
000 restricted shares of its Common Stock on or before October 15
 2019
 in consideration of the Promissory
    Note
 in exchange for extinguishment of all prior granted warrants and to complete the grant of 1
000
000 shares not received
    from a prior transaction. The Company issued such 1
500
000 restricted shares and the expense for such issuance was accrued
    on the Company&rsquo;s Balance Sheet on the effective date of the Rule 11 Agreement and increased by $45
000 based upon the
    actual value of the shares on the date of issuance for the period ending December 31
 2019.


The
Rule 11 Agreement further provided that if the Company timely performed through October 15
 2019
 the Parties would file a Joint
Motion for Dismissal and present Agreed Orders of Dismissal with prejudice for both lawsuits. A copy of the Rule 11 Agreement
is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 10.52.

The
Company performed in all regards under the Rule 11 Agreement
 however Gleason refused to sign the Wildcat Settlement Agreement
at the point of the Company&rsquo;s having performed its obligations. The parties&rsquo; respective counsels then mutually agreed
to extend the original October 15
 2019 settlement date until at least the end of the year while the parties waited for Gleason&rsquo;s
signature. Gleason signed the Compromise Settlement and Release Agreement on February 4
 2020
 and all litigation was dismissed
by the Court on February 25

Management&rsquo;s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended December 31
2019 and 2018 should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the notes to those Financial Statements that are
included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and were prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our discussion includes
forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties
 such as our plans
 objectives
expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of a number of factors
 including those set forth under the &ldquo;Risk Factors
&rdquo; &ldquo;Cautionary
Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&rdquo; and &ldquo;Description of Business&rdquo; sections and elsewhere in this Form
10-K. We use words such as &ldquo;anticipate
&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate
&rdquo; &ldquo;plan
&rdquo; &ldquo;project
&rdquo; &ldquo;continuing
&rdquo;
&ldquo;ongoing
&rdquo; &ldquo;expect

&rdquo; &ldquo;may
&rdquo; &ldquo;will
&rdquo;
&ldquo;should
&rdquo; &ldquo;could
&rdquo; &ldquo;predict
&rdquo; and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.
Although we believe the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within
the bounds of our knowledge of our business
 our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements.
We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason even if new information becomes available
or other events occur in the future.

In
the below discussion
 &ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;our
&rdquo; &ldquo;us
&rdquo; the &ldquo;Company&rdquo; and similar terms in this
report
 as well as references to &ldquo;UMED&rdquo; and &ldquo;Greenway&rdquo; all refer to Greenway Technologies
 Inc.
 and our
wholly-owned subsidiary
 Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc.
 unless the context requires otherwise.

Greenway
Technologies
 Inc. is engaged in the research and development of proprietary gas-to-liquids syngas conversion systems and micro-plants
that can be scaled to meet specific gas field production requirements. The company&rsquo;s patented and proprietary technologies
have been realized in its first commercial G-Reformer unit
 a unique component used to convert natural gas into synthesis gas
which when combined with a Fischer-Tropsch reactor and catalyst
 produces fuels including gasoline
 diesel
 jet fuel and methanol.
G-Reformer units can be deployed to process a variety of natural gas streams including pipeline gas
 associated gas
 flared gas
vented gas
 coal-bed methane and/or biomass gas. When derived from any of these natural gas sources
 the liquid fuels created
are incrementally cleaner than conventionally produced oil-based fuels. Greenway&rsquo;s objective is to become a material direct
and licensed producer of renewable GTL synthesized diesel and jet fuels
 with a near term focus on U.S. market opportunities.

The
Company believes that its proprietary G-Reformer is a major innovation in gas reforming and GTL technology in general. Initial
tests have demonstrated that the Company&rsquo;s solution appears to be superior to legacy technologies which are more costly
have a larger footprint and cannot be easily deployed at field sites to process associated gas
 stranded gas
 coal-bed methane
vented gas
 or flared gas - all markets the Company seeks to service.

Further
the Company believes its technologies and processes will allow for multiple small-scale GTL plants to be built with substantially
lower up-front and ongoing costs resulting in more profitable results for O&amp;G operators. In addition
 the proprietary technology
based around the G-Reformer is unique in that it also allows for transportable (mobile) GTL plants with a much smaller footprint
as compared to legacy large-scale technologies. Greenway is in discussions with a number of oil and gas operators and other interested
parties to license and obtain joint venture or other forms of capital funding to build its first third-party customer gas-to-liquid
plant.


    
    


Mining
Interest

In
December 2010
 UMED acquired the rights to approximately 1
440 acres of placer mining claims located on Bureau of Land Management
(&ldquo;BLM&rdquo;) land in Mohave County
 Arizona for 5
066
000 shares of restricted Common A stock. Early indications
 from
samples taken and processed
 provided reason to believe that the potential recovery value of the metals located on the 1
440 acres
is significant
 but only actual mining and processing will determine the ultimate value which may be realized from this property
holding. The Company is currently exploring strategic options to partner or sell its interest in this acreage
 while it focuses
on its emerging GTL technology sales and marketing efforts.

Going
Concern

We
remain dependent on outside sources of funding for continuation of our operations. Our independent registered public accounting
firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated April 14
 2020
 which is included with our Financial Statements
and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

As
of December 31
 2019
 we had total liabilities in excess of assets by $6
889
485. Also
 during the year ended December 31
 2019
we used net cash of $1
332
528 for operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern.

The
Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue
in existence. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient new cash flows to
meet our obligations on a timely basis
 to obtain additional financing as may be required
 and/or ultimately to attain profitable
operations. However
 there is no assurance that profitable operations
 financing
 or sufficient new cash flows will occur in the
future.

Our
ability to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to finance
 manufacture
 and market/operate GTL units. Our growth
is dependent on attaining profit from our operations and our raising additional capital either through the sale of our Common
Stock or borrowing. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any equity financing or sell any of our products at a
profit. We will be unable to pay our obligations in the normal course of business or service our debt in a timely manner throughout
2020 without raising additional debt or equity capital. There can be no assurance that we will raise additional debt or equity
capital.

We
are currently evaluating strategic alternatives that include (i) raising new equity capital and/or (ii) issuing additional debt
instruments. The process is ongoing
 lengthy and has inherent costs. There can be no assurance that the exploration of these strategic
alternatives will result in any specific action to alleviate our 12-month working capital needs or result in any other transaction.

While
we are attempting to commence operations and generate revenues
 our cash position may not be significant enough to support our
daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of an offering of our securities. Management believes that
the actions presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for us
to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise
additional funds
 we may not be successful. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our capability to further
implement our business plan and generate revenues.

Operating
Expenses
 2019
 operating expenses decreased to $2
429
431
 as compared to $2
886
021 for
the year ended December 31
 2018. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in consulting fees to $251
377 in 2019 compared
to $1
373
578 to the same period in 2018
 and offset by an increase in legal expense of $180
344 and Salaries Expenses
of $787
589
 including non-cash stock compensation expenses of $420
000 in 2019 as compared to 2018
 when certain consultants
became salaried employees in 2019. Major operating expense categories consisted of the following:

.
During the year ended December 31
 2019
 total salaries increased to $1
020
923 as compared to $233
334 for the year ended December
31
 2018. The increase primarily reflects certain consultants becoming employees during the period
 including non-cash stock compensation
expense of $420
000 in 2019
 compared to $0 2018.

Consulting
Fees
 2019
 consulting expense decreased to $251
377
 as compared to $1
373
578
for the year ended December 31
 2018. The decrease was primarily due to certain consultants becoming employees of the Company
and a decreased reliance on the use of consultants for the development and production of the Company&rsquo;s GTL technologies
during the period.

Professional
Fees
 2019
 professional fees decreased to $6
292
 as compared to $24
358 for the year
ended December 31
 2108. Professional fees decreased due to elimination of certain prior vendors.

Travel
Expenses
 2019
 travel expenses decreased to $11
120
 as compared to $30
113 in the year
ended December 31
 2018. The decrease in travel expenses was due to the termination of prior employees and a reduced need for
employees to travel generally.

Settlement
Expense.
 2019
 we completed a final settlement of the Mamaki Tea litigation
 resulting
in a one-time charge of $765
000. There is no comparative expense for the year ended December 31
 2018.

Legal
Expenses
 2019
 legal expenses increased to $477
417
 as compared to $297
073 in the year
ended December 31
 2018. The increase in legal fees was due primarily to additional work related to the dissident Shareholder
actions and settlement of various matters that were in
 or soon to be in
 litigation.

Research
and Development Costs
 2019
 research and development costs decreased to $441
320
 as compared
to $630
518 in the year ended December 31
 2018. The decrease was due to us reaching the completion of our initial GTL research
activities and the start of migration to a commercial production environment.


    
    


Interest
Expense.
 2019
 interest expense increased to $443
760
 including to related parties of
$188
267
 as compared to $126
461 for the year ended December 31
 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increase of debt
financing versus the sale of securities to support operating expenses.

Derivative
 During the year ended December 31

 loss on derivative adjustment was $64
899
 as compared to $34
500

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

We
do not currently have sufficient working capital to fund our expected future operations. We cannot assure investors that we will
be able to continue our operations without securing additional adequate funding. We had $16
043 in cash
 total assets of $428
890
and total liabilities of $7
318
375 as of December 31
 2019. Total Accumulated deficit at December 31

Our
accompanying Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our general business strategy is to first develop our GTL technology
to maintain our basic viability
 while seeking significant development capital for full commercialization. As shown in the accompanying
Financial Statements
 we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $30
479
829 and $26
818

 2019
 and 2018

and on our ability to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations.



Capital
Expenditures

The
&rdquo;) under our SRA with UTA was completed in the year ended December 2019
 with
payments made of $120
000 to complete the work described in the last SOW. As we move into commercialization of our GTL technology
we plan to update and enter into a new SOW with UTA for 2020 and 2021. This is anticipated to entail a financial commitment of
approximately $257
000 for a twelve-month cycle
 which we have been told can be payable in four equal installments of $64
250.
However
 we shall only execute such new SOW and notice UTA to start such work when we have funds available to make such payments.
As described elsewhere herein this Report
 we are working to raise sufficient capital to enter such new SOW
 including from private
stock sales
 additional debt and payment from of our receivable with OPMGE. There is no assurance we that we will be able to raise
such sufficient funds to enter into such new Scope of Work.

On
September 7
 2018
 Wildcat
 a company controlled by Shareholder Gleason
 filed suit against us alleging claims arising from the
Gleason Agreement
 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&rsquo;s fees. In a separate lawsuit
Wildcat filed suit claiming that the Company breached that certain Promissory Note dated on or about November 13
 2017
 entered
into between Wildcat as lender and Greenway as borrower
 and as a result Wildcat initiated an action in County Court at Law No.

 Cause No. 2018-006416-2. On March 6
 2019
 we entered into a Rule 11 Agreement with Gleason settling
both disputes

11 Agreement
 the parties agreed to abate both cases until the earlier of a default of the performance of the Rule 11 Agreement
or October 30
 2019
 whichever be sooner. The Rule 11 Agreement provided that if we timely performed through October 15
 2019
the parties would file a joint motion for dismissal and present agreed orders of dismissal with prejudice for both lawsuits. The
Company performed in all regards under the Rule 11 Agreement
 however Gleason refused to sign the Wildcat Settlement Agreement
at the point of the Company&rsquo;s having performed its obligations. The parties&rsquo; respective counsels then mutually agreed
to extend the original October 15
 2019 settlement date until at least the end of the year while the parties waited for Gleason&rsquo;s
signature. Gleason signed the Compromise Settlement and Release Agreement on February 4
 2020
 and all litigation was dismissed
by the Court on February 25

In
June 2019
 Michael Wykrent
 a director purchased 1
200
000 shares of our Rule 144 restricted Common Stock
 par value $.0001 per
share for $60
000 in a private sale.

In
September 2019
 we sold 4

000 shares of our Rule 144 Common Stock
 par value $.0001 per share for $200
000 to an accredited
investor in a private sale.

In
December 2019
 we sold 1
250
000 shares of our Rule 144 Common Stock
 par value $.0001 per share for $100

We
have also received loans from external lenders. In January 2020
 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;Purchase
Agreement&rdquo;)
 with PowerUp Lending Group
 Ltd.
 a Virginia corporation (&ldquo;PowerUp&rdquo;)
 that specializes in making
funding commitments to small-cap public companies. PowerUp has agreed to provide up to $1
000
000 to us over a twelve (12) month
period
 subject to period determined stock price and trading attributes
 and we have received $171
000 during the first quarter
of 2020 under this from of Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties
 covenants
and conditions to closing. The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement and the Notes do not purport to be complete and
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement and the Notes
 which are filed herewith
as Exhibits 10.63 - 10.66

On
July 25
 2019
 a Trustee for the Greer Trust sent notice to the Company of their election to convert all unpaid principal and
accrued interest of $183
220 due under the Greer Note. The conversion price as calculated according to the Note&rsquo;s terms
was $0.0469 per share
 resulting in a conversion of the Note and accrued interest into 3
906
610 shares of the Company&rsquo;s

our Financial Statements herein below.

On
December 20
 2018
 the Company issued a convertible promissory note for $166
667
 payable by December 20
 2020. This loan is in
default for breach of payment. By its terms
 the cash interest payable increased to 18% per annum on December 20
 2018 and continues

Statements herein below.



We
do not anticipate that our business will be affected by seasonal factors.

Impact
of Inflation

While
we are subject to general inflationary trends
 including for basic manufacturing production materials
 our management believes
that inflation in and of itself does not have a material effect on our operating results. However
 inflation may become a factor
in the future. However
 subsequent to year end 2019
 the COVID-19 virus and its current extraordinary impact on the world economy
has reduced oil consumption globally
 decreasing crude oil prices
 to levels not seen since the early 1980&rsquo;s. The economics
of GTL conversion rely in part on the arbitrage between oil and natural gas prices
 with economic models for many producers
 including
our own models
 using a range of $30-60/bbl (for WTI or Brent Crude as listed daily on the Nymex and ICE commodities exchanges)
to determine relative profitability of their GTL operations. While the COVID-19 virus may run its human course in the near term
we believe (as many others in the U.S. government and media believe)
 that the economic impacts will be long lasting and for all
practical matters
 remain largely unknown at this time.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

During
the year ended December 2019
 we entered into a revenue interest research and development venture with Mabert and an employee
Tom Phillips
 OPMGE. We account for our participation under the Equity Method
 as further defined herein below
 whereby we may
be subject to future gains and losses that are reasonably likely to have an effect on our reported results of operations and liquidity.
We are not required to invest
 participate in any of the ongoing costs
 financing or capital expenditures made by OPMGE. We advanced
$387
847 to OPMGE which we have accrued as a related party receivable and expect to be paid such advances as OPMGE receives expected
financing and ramps up its operations in 2020.


    
    


Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our
Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
&rdquo;). Preparing our Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
impact the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenue
 and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&rsquo;s
application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets.

We
recognize revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101
 &ldquo;Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.&rdquo;
Sales will be recorded when products are shipped to customers. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated returns
and allowances
 and other adjustments will be provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.

We
evaluate our long-lived assets for financial impairment on a regular basis in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144


of long-lived assets not held for sale by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated discounted future
cash flows associated with them. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future discounted cash flows of certain long-lived
assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets
 the assets are adjusted to their fair values.

We
believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of our financial statements.

Revenue
Recognition

The
&ndash; Revenue from
Contracts with Customers
 as guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments
in 2015 and 2016. Revenue recognition will depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires
disclosures regarding the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with
the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up
transition method). We adopted the guidance on January 1
 2018 and applied the cumulative catch-up transition method. The transition
adjustment to be recorded to stockholders&rsquo; deficit upon adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect upon
the consolidated financial statements.

The
Company has not
 to date
 generated any revenues.

Equity
Method Investment

On
August 29
 2019
 we entered into a research and development venture
 OPMGE
 with Mabert and an employee
 Tom Phillips. We contributed
a limited license to use our proprietary and patented GTL technology and a working G-Reformer refractory unit
 for no actual cost
basis
 in exchange for 300 membership units in OPMGE
 equating to an approximately a 42.8% current interest in OPMGE
 pending
the expected issuance of an additional 300 membership units
 equating to a net 30% ownership interest in OPMGE at that time. There
is no book or asset value attributed to the contributed technology. We evaluated our interest in OPMGE and determined that we
do not control OPMGE. We account for our interest in OPMGE via the equity method of accounting. To our knowledge
 at December
31
 2019
 OPMGE had no material activity as of such date. As described in &ldquo;Note 9 &ndash; Related Party Transactions&rdquo;
in our Financial Statements
 we maintain a related party receivable from OPMGE related to advances made to assist in certain capital
expenditures. We expect to fully recover the receivable once OPMGE operations ramp up in 2020.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Accounting
Standard 718
 &ldquo;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 718&rdquo;) established financial accounting and
reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. It defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee
stock option or similar equity instrument. In January 2006
 we implemented ASC 718
 and accordingly
 we account for compensation
cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718. We account for share-based payments to non-employees in accordance with
ASC 505-50 &ldquo;Accounting for Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring
 or in Conjunction with Selling
 Goods
or Services&rdquo;.


    
    


Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our Financial
Statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ materially
from the estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

We
consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 3-months or less to be cash equivalents. There were
no cash equivalents at December 31
 2019
 or December 31
 2018. Unless otherwise indicated
 all references to &ldquo;dollars&rdquo;
in this Form 10-K are to U.S. dollars.

Income
Taxes

We
account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes
&rdquo; which requires that we recognize deferred
tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets
and liabilities
 using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit
(expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when
it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We

&rdquo;).
ASC 750-10-05 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&rsquo;s financial statements
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a
tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally
 ASC 750-10-05 provides guidance on de-recognition
 classification
interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods
 disclosure and transition. Open tax years
 subject to IRS examination include
2014 &ndash; 2018.

Net
Loss per Share
 Basic and Diluted

We

 Earnings per Share
 specifying the computation
 presentation
and disclosure requirements of earning per share information. Basic loss per share has been computed by dividing net loss available
to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding for the period. Shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants (10
857
737)
 shares of Common Stock convertible for debt (2
083
333) and shares
of Common Stock outstanding but not yet issued (6
000
986) have been excluded as a Common Stock equivalent in the diluted loss
per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

The
Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815

(&ldquo;ASC 815&rdquo;)

 including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
 and for hedging activities. ASC 815 requires that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.

If
certain conditions are met
 a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge
 the objective of which is to match the timing
of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged
asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction.
For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument
 the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change.


    
    


See
Note 6 &ndash; Other Notes Payable on page F-13 to our Financial Statements for a more detailed description regarding our current
convertible notes payable and warrants.

Concentration
and Credit Risk

Financial
instruments and related items
 which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk
 consist primarily of cash
 cash
equivalents
 and trade receivables. We place our cash and temporary cash investments with high -credit quality institutions. At
times
 such investments may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
September 2014
&rdquo;) No. 2014-10
 &ldquo;Development Stage Entities
(Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance
in Topic 810
 Consolidation.&rdquo; ASU No. 2014-10 removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development
stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. In addition
 ASU 2014-10 adds
an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal
operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties related to our current activities. Furthermore
 the update
removes an exception provided to development stage entities in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is
a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for
a company that has an interest in a company in the development stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15
 2014
 including interim periods therein. Early application with the first annual reporting period
or interim period for which the entity&rsquo;s financial statements have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made
available for issuance (other entities). We adopted this pronouncement as of January 1
 2019.

FASB&rsquo;s
new lease accounting standard
 Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 as provided by FASB in ASU No. 2018-11
Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements
 whereby we would recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of
retained earnings in the period of adoption
 will be applied to any new leases we enter into where this standard would otherwise
apply. We do not have any lease agreements where such lease accounting standards would apply.

Impact
of New Accounting Standards

We
have reviewed all other recently issued
 but not yet adopted
 accounting standards in order to determine their effects
 if any
on our results of operation
 financial position or cash flows. Based on that review
 we believe that none of these pronouncements
are expected to have a significant effect on our Financial Statements.

Subsequent
Events

In
March 2020
 the outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus) caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was recognized as a pandemic by
the World Health Organization
 and the outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States
 including in each of
the areas in which the Company operates. While to date the Company has not been required to stop operating
 management is evaluating
its use of its office space
 virtual meetings and the like. The Company continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus)
outbreak closely. The extent to which the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak will impact our operations
 ability to obtain financing
or future financial results is uncertain.

Controls and
    Procedures.


Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The
term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer&rsquo;s management
including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by
or under the supervision of
 our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer and effected by our Board of
Directors
 management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures
that:



    
    
Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the assets of the issuer;

    
    
    

    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with GAAP
 and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
    and directors of the issuer; and

    
    
    

    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the issuer&rsquo;s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



    
    


Our
management
 including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
 does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system
 no matter
how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems
 internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 have been detected. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
the year ending December 2019
 we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control&mdash;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Management&rsquo;s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial
reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 have concluded that as of December 31
 2019
 our internal control
over financial reporting was ineffective.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by
or under the supervision of
 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors
management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

As
of December 31
 2019
 we conducted an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer
 of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the framework
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our
management&rsquo;s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing
of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation
 management has concluded
that as of December 31
 2019
 our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective.

We
have identified at least the following deficiencies
 which together constitute a material weakness in our assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019:



    
We have
    inadequate segregation of duties within our cash disbursement control design.

    
    

    
During the year
    ended December 31
 2019
 we internally performed all aspects of our financial reporting process including
 but not limited
    to
 the underlying accounting records and record journal entries and internally maintained responsibility for the preparation
    of the financial statements. Due to the fact these duties were often performed by the same people
 a lack of independent review
    process was created over the financial reporting process that might result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets
    calculations
 or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These
    control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not
    be prevented or detected.

    
    

    
We do not have a
    sufficient number of independent or qualified directors for our Board of Directors and a qualified Audit Committee. We currently
    have only two (2) independent directors on our board
 which is fully comprised of six directors
 and accordingly we do not
    yet have a functioning audit committee
 as the only otherwise qualified director is not independent. Further
 as a publicly
    traded company
 we should strive to have a majority of our board of directors be independent.



    
    


We
are continuing the process of remediating our control deficiencies. However
 the material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting that have been identified will not be remediated until numerous new internal controls are implemented and operate for
a period of time
 are tested
 and we are able to conclude that such internal controls are operating effectively. We cannot provide
assurance that these procedures will be successful in identifying material errors that may exist in our Financial Statements.
We cannot make assurances that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
in the future. Our management plans
 as capital becomes available to us
 to increase the accounting and financial reporting staff
and provide future investments in the continuing education and public company accounting training of our accounting and financial
professionals.

It
should be noted that any system of controls
 however well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 and not absolute
assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition
 the design of any control system is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control system
 there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
 regardless of
how remote.

Our
management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have a material effect on our financial results. However
the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors results in
potentially ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures and could potentially
have an impact our financial statements.

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31
 2019
 that have materially affected
 or are
reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

Committees
of the Board

On
June 22
 2018
 pursuant to the authority granted to our Board of Directors in Section 2.10 of Article Two of our bylaws
 the Board
&rdquo;). As of the date of this report
 the
designated directors comprising the Executive Committee include Ray Wright
 Kent Harer
 Paul Alfano and Ransom Jones. The Executive
Committee may consider and review any and all such matters or issues it deems necessary coming before us and take such further
lawful actions as it determines to be consistent with its responsibilities. Given our small size
 with the exception of the Executive
Committee
 our entire Board of Directors participates in all of the considerations with respect to our audit
 compensation and
nomination deliberations.

The
responsibilities of other committees now or to be adopted in the future are currently are fulfilled by our Board of Directors
and all of our directors participate in such responsibilities
 two of whom are &ldquo;independent&rdquo; as defined in the listing
standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market
 Inc.
 which states in part
 that
 &ldquo;that an independent director must not be an officer
or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship that
 in the opinion of the company&rsquo;s
board of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.&rdquo;

Audit
Committee

Our
entire Board of Directors currently performs the functions of an audit committee
 but no written charter governs the actions of
our Board of Directors when performing the functions of what would generally be performed by an audit committee. Our Board of
Directors approves the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with the independent accountants to discuss
issues related to financial reporting. In addition
 our Board of Directors reviews the scope and results of the audit with the
independent accountants
 reviews with management and the independent accountants our annual operating results
 considers the adequacy
of our internal accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters including fees to be paid to the independent
auditor and the performance of the independent auditor. At the present time
 Ransom Jones
 our Chief Financial Officer and one
of our directors
 is considered to be our expert in financial and accounting matters.

Nomination
Committee

Due
to our size and the size of our Board of Directors
 we do not require a separate nominating committee at this time. When evaluating
director nominees
 our directors consider the following factors:



    
    
The
    appropriate size of our Board of Directors;

    
    
    

    
    
The knowledge
 skills
    and experience of nominees
 including experience in finance
 administration or public service
 in light of prevailing business
    conditions and the knowledge
 skills and experience already possessed by other members of our Board of Directors;

    
    
    

    
    
Experience in political
    affairs;

    
    
    

    
    
Experience
    with accounting rules and practices; and

    
    
    

    
    
The desire to balance
    the benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective provided by new members of our Board of Directors.



    
    



Our
goal is to assemble a Board of Directors that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high-quality business
and professional experience. In doing so
 our Board of Directors will also consider candidates with appropriate non-business backgrounds.

Other
than the foregoing
 there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees
 although our Board of Directors may also consider
such other factors as it may deem are in our best interests as well as the interests of our Shareholders. In addition
 our Board
of Directors identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of our Board of Directors willing to continue in service.
Current members of our Board of Directors with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to
continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of our Board of Directors does not wish to continue in service
or if our Board of Directors decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election
 our Board of Directors then identifies the desired
skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above. Current members of our Board of Directors are polled for
suggestions as to individuals meeting the criteria described above. Our Board of Directors may also engage in research to identify
qualified individuals. To date
 we have not engaged third parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees
although we reserve the right in the future to retain a third-party search firm
 if necessary. Our Board of Directors does not
typically consider Shareholder nominees
 because it believes that our current nomination process is sufficient to identify directors
who serve our Shareholders&rsquo; best interests

As
&rdquo;) held on December
11
 2019
 we amended our Certificate of Formation (fka Articles of Incorporation) to change the voting requirements specifying
that the vote required to approve certain actions before our Stockholders
 including &ldquo;fundamental actions
&rdquo; as defined
by Texas Business Organizations Code (the &ldquo;TBOC&rdquo;) Section 21.364
 and &ldquo;fundamental business transactions
&rdquo;
as defined by TBOC Section 1.002(32). See our Form 8-K filed December 16
 2019 for more detailed information

reference herein.

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports

Section
&rdquo;) requires our officers
 directors and persons who beneficially own
more than 10% of our Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. These reporting persons
also are required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

Certain Relationships
    and Related Transactions and Director Independence.


Other
than as stated herein
 there are no other agreements with any of our officers and directors.

After
approval given during a properly called special meeting of the Board of Directors
 on September 14
 2018
 Mabert
 which is owned
and controlled by our director and Shareholder
 Kevin Jones
 and his wife Christine Early
 entered into a loan agreement with
&rdquo;)
 for the purpose of funding working capital and general corporate expenses of up
to $1
500
&rdquo;). With Board of Directors consent
 the Loan Amount was subsequently increased
to provide up to a total $5
000
000 of availability under the Loan Agreement for us. The Company&rsquo;s bylaws provide no bar
from transactions with Interested Directors
 so long as the interested party does not vote on such transaction. Mr. Jones did
not vote on this transaction.

Mr.
Jones
 his wife and Mabert have loaned a total $1
426
056 to the Company and four other Shareholders have loaned the balance of
$605
000
 pursuant to the Loan Agreement
 through the year ending December 31
 2019. These loans are secured by the assets of
our Company. A financing statement and UCC-1 have been filed according to Texas statutes. Should a default under the Loan Agreement
occur
 there could be a foreclosure or a bankruptcy proceeding filed by Mabert on behalf of the lenders party to the Loan Agreement.
A foreclosure sale or distribution through bankruptcy could only result in the creditors receiving a pro rata payment based upon
the terms of the Loan Agreement. Mabert did not nor will it receive cash compensation for its efforts.

Mr.
Jones
 as the owner and managing member of Mabert
 is also the managing and control member of OPMGE
 a research and development
venture in and to which the Company has a significant revenue member interest and has licensed its proprietary GTL technology
and equipment. Due to Mr. Kevin Jones&rsquo; family relationship as the brother of Mr. Ransom Jones
 our CFO
 and his control
position over Mabert and OPMGE
 Mr. Jones is not considered an independent director.

Mr.
Michael Wykrent
 a director
 made loans totaling $425
000 under the Mabert Loan Agreement to us prior to his being elected as
a director of the Company. Mabert operates as an agent for various lenders
 including Mr. Wykrent
 and manages such loans on behalf
of the various lenders under the Loan Agreement. Mr. Wykrent was elected as a non-executive director and we believe that Mr. Wykrent
remains an independent director
 despite having this lending relationship through Mabert
 which
 in the opinion of the Company&rsquo;s
Board of Directors
 would not interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of
a director.

Mr.
Paul Alfano
 a director
 was contracted as a consultant by the Company in April 2018 prior to his being elected as a director
of the Company
 thereupon such consulting contract was terminated. In his consulting role
 Mr. Alfano&rsquo;s total fees never
exceeded $120
000 for any prior period. We have accrued a total $94
038 for the fees and expenses that were remaining under his
consulting agreement at the time Mr. Alfano was elected as a non-executive director. At the current time
 there is no specific
timetable for repayment of such accrued expenses and we believe that Mr. Alfano remains an independent director
 despite having
these accrued prior consulting expenses
 which
 in the opinion of the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors
 would not interfere
with the exercise of his independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.


    
    


Three
directors
 Kevin Harer
 Ransom Jones and Kevin Jones made advances of $51
019 to us in the fourth quarter of 2019
 in cash amounts
of $25
000 and $25
000 respectively
 and $1
019 in the form of a non-reimbursed payment for services. Although we expect to repay
such advances during fiscal year 2020
 actual repayment of such advances is subject to an indefinite timeframe due to our financial
condition and circumstances
 and each director recognizes that we may not be able to make such repayments on a timely basis.

Director
Kevin Jones
 through Mabert
 acquired a non-operational GTL plant in Wharton
 TX in July 2019
 and contributed it form a joint
venture with us in August 2019
 which included a separate interest for one of our key employees
 Tom Phillips
 who owns a 10%
revenue interest
 in OPMGE. We agreed to contribute a limited license to our proprietary technology and equipment
 and also agreed
to share Phillips and other Company personnel with OPMGE
 in order for it to complete third party engineering certification. While
there are no salaried positions currently being provided by OPMGE
 we have no assurance that a salaried position could be offered
to Phillips
 and that he could find such position better than his role as VP of Operation with us. Further
 the substantial 10%
revenue interest held by Phillips
 allowing him to participate in any future profitability of OPMGE may also provide incentive
for him to leave us. The loss of this key employee could cause unforeseen interruptions to our business until such time as a replacement
engineer is found and hired by us.

Director
Independence

Mr.
Alfano and Mr. Wykrent serve as our two independent directors. We use the definition of &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; as
defined in the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market
 Inc. Under this standard
 an &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; is
a person other than an executive officer or employee of a company or any other individual having a relationship which
 in the
opinion of the issuer&rsquo;s board of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the
responsibilities of a director. In addition
 the following persons shall not be considered independent:



    
    
A director
    who is
 or at any time during the past three years was
 employed by the Company;

    
    
A director who accepted
    or who has a family member who accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120
000 during any period of 12 consecutive
    months within the three years preceding the determination of independence
 other than the following: (i) compensation for
    board or board committee service; (ii) compensation paid to a family member who is an employee (other than as an executive
    officer) of the issuer; or (iii) benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan
 or non-discretionary compensation;

    
    
A director who is
    a family member of an individual who is
 or at any time during the past three years was
 employed by the company as an executive
    officer;

    
    
A director who is
    or has a family member who is
 a partner in
 or a controlling shareholder or an executive officer of
 any organization to
    which the company made
 or from which the company received
 payments for property or services in the current or any of the
    past three fiscal years that exceed five percent of the recipient&rsquo;s consolidated gross revenues for that year
 or $200
000
    whichever is more
 other than the following: (i) payments arising solely from investments in the company&rsquo;s securities;
    or (ii) payments under non-discretionary charitable contribution matching programs;

    
    
A director of the
    issuer who is
 or has a family member who is
 employed as an executive officer of another entity where at any time during
    the past three years any of the executive officers of the issuer serve on the compensation committee of such other entity;
    or

    
    
A director who is
    or has a family member who is
 a current partner of the company&rsquo;s outside auditor
 or was a partner or employee of the
    registrant&rsquo;s outside auditor who worked on the company&rsquo;s audit at any time during any of the past three years.


Under
these standards required to an independent director
 none of Mr. Harer
 Mr. K. Jones
 Mr. R. Jones
 nor Mr. Wright qualify as
independent directors.

We
hope to add additional qualified independent members to our Board of Directors at a later date
 depending upon our ability to
reach and maintain financial stability and/or continuing operations.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders
of Greenway Technologies
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Greenway Technologies
 Inc. (the Company) as of December 31
 2019
and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; deficit and cash flows for the year ended December
31
 2019 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial
statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2019 and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31
 2019
 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

Explanatory
Paragraph - Going Concern

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements
 the Company has suffered recurring losses for the year ended December 31
2019. The Company had a net loss of $3
661
245
 accumulated deficit of $30
479
829
 net cash used in operating activities of $1
332
528
and had negative working capital of $6
364
485. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue
as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audit
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders
of Greenway Technologies
 Inc. and Subsidiary

Opinion
on the consolidated financial statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Greenway Technologies
 Inc. and subsidiary (the Company) as of December
31
 2018 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; deficit
 and cash flows for the year ended
December 31
 2018 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;consolidated financial statements&rdquo;). In
our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company
as of December 31
 2018 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31
 2018
 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Going
Concern

The
accompanying consolidated financials have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December
31
 2018
 the Company had accumulated losses of $26
818
584
 has generated no profit
 and may experiences losses in the near term.
These factors and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plan
 raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plan to continue as a going concern is also described in
Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis
for Opinion

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether
due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audit
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
 whether
due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December
31
 2019 and 2018

NOTE
1 &ndash; ORGANIZATION

Nature
of Operations

Greenway
Technologies
 Inc.
 (&ldquo;Greenway&rdquo;
 &ldquo;GTI&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) through its wholly owned subsidiary
Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc.
 is primarily engaged in the research
 development and commercialization of a proprietary Gas-to-Liquids
(GTL) syngas conversion system that can be economically scaled to meet individual natural gas field/resource requirements. The
Company&rsquo;s proprietary and patented technology has now been realized in Greenway&rsquo;s recently completed first generation
commercial-scale G-ReformerTM refractory unit
 a unique and critical component to the Company&rsquo;s overall GTL technology solution.
Greenway&rsquo;s objective is to become a material direct and licensed producer of renewable GTL synthesized gasoline
 diesel
and jet fuels
 with a near term focus on U.S. market opportunities.

Greenway&rsquo;s
GTL Technology

In
August 2012
 Greenway Technologies acquired 100% of Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc. (&ldquo;GIE&rdquo;) which owns patents and
trade secrets for a proprietary technology to convert natural gas into synthesis gas (&ldquo;syngas&rdquo;). Based on its breakthrough
process called Fractional Thermal Oxidation&trade; (&ldquo;FTO&rdquo;)
 the Company believes that the G-Reformer
 combined with
conventional Fischer-Tropsch (&ldquo;FT&rdquo;) processes
 offers an economical and scalable method to converting natural gas
to liquid fuel.

To
facilitate the commercialization process
 Greenway announced in August 2019 that it had entered into an agreement to partially
own and operate an existing GTL plant located in Wharton
 Texas. Originally acquired by Mabert
 a company controlled by director
Kevin Jones
 members include OPMGE (a company formed to facilitate the joint venture)
 Mabert and Tom Phillips
 an employee of
the Company. The Company&rsquo;s involvement in the venture is intended to facilitate third-party certification of the Company&rsquo;s
G-Reformer technology
 related equipment and technology. In addition
 the Company anticipates that OPMGE&rsquo;s operations will
demonstrate that the G-Reformer is a commercially viable technology for producing syngas and marketable fuel products. As the
first operating GTL plant to use Greenway&rsquo;s proprietary reforming technology and equipment
 the Wharton joint venture facility
is initially expected to yield a minimum of 75 - 100 barrels per day of gasoline and diesel fuels from converted natural gas.

The
Company believes that its proprietary G-Reformer is a major innovation in gas reforming and GTL technology in general. Initial
tests have demonstrated that the Company&rsquo;s solution appears to be superior to legacy technologies which are more costly
have a larger footprint and cannot be easily deployed at field sites to process associated gas
 stranded gas
 coal-bed methane
vented gas
 or flared gas
 all markets the Company seeks to service. The new plant is anticipated to prove out the economics for
the Company&rsquo;s technology and GTL processes.

NOTE
2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Greenway and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
There are no assets
 liabilities or operations in the Universal Media Corporation and Logistix Technology Systems subsidiaries
identified below. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the following entities:



    
    
    
    
    


 Inc.
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    


 Inc.
    
    
    
    


 Inc.
    
    
    
    



    
    


Going
Concern Uncertainties

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis
which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December
31
 2019
 we have an accumulated deficit of $30
479
829. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we incurred a net loss of $3
661
245
and used $1
332
528 in net cash for operating activities. In addition
 we had a working capital deficiency of $6
364
485 as of
December 31
 2019. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable
level of operations or on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. While the Company
is attempting to commence revenue generating operations and thereby generate sustainable revenues
 the Company&rsquo;s current
cash position is not sufficient to support its ongoing daily operations and requires the Company to raise addition capital through
debt and/or equity sources. Management believes that its current and future plans will enable it to continue as a going concern
for the next twelve months from the date of this report.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recorded assets or liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company have to curtail operations or be unable to continue in existence.



Certain
amounts for the current year ending December 2019 have been reclassified and are now shown in their own line descriptions on the
balance sheet as compared to the prior year
 to properly reflect the balances in each category. This includes the reclassification
of certain Accrued management fees in 2018 reclassified to Accrued expenses-related parties
 Accounts payable and Accrued interest
payable for 2019.

NOTE
3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A
summary of significant accounting policies applied in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment is recorded at cost. Major additions and improvements are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation
of equipment retired or sold
 are removed from the accounts and any differences between the undepreciated amount and the proceeds
from the sale or salvage value are recorded as a gain or loss on sale of equipment. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful life of the assets.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

The
Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable
 in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
 ASC Topic 360

 Plant and Equipment
An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset
or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered impaired
 the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value. If estimated fair value is less than
the book value
 the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. There were no long-lived
assets or impairment charges for the year ended December 31
 2019.

Revenue
Recognition

The
FASB issued ASC 606 as guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015
and 2016. Revenue recognition will depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures
regarding the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company
adopted the guidance on January 1
 2018
 its effective date. The Company has not
 to date
 generated any revenues.

Equity
Method Investment

On
August 29
 2019
 the Company entered into a Material Definitive Agreement related to the formation of OPM Green Energy
 LLC (OPMGE).
The Company contributed a limited license to use its proprietary and patented GTL technology for no actual cost basis in exchange
for 42.86% (300 of 700 currently owned member units) revenue interest in OPMGE
 expected to be later reduced to a 30% interest
upon the completion of certain expected third-party investments for the remining 300 of 1
000 member units available. The Company
evaluated its interest in OPMGE and determined that the Company does not control OPMGE. The Company accounts for its interest
in OPMGE via the equity method of accounting. At December 31
 2019
 there was no change in the investment cost of $0. At December
31
 2019
 OPMGE had no material activity as of such date. As described in Note 9
 the Company maintains a Related Party
receivable with OPMGE for $387
847 related to our advancing capital for certain of its capital expenditures. The Company expects
to fully recover the receivable once OPMGE operations ramp up in 2020.


    
    


Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include allowance for collectible receivables
 derivative liability valuations
and deferred tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from such estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three-months or less to be cash equivalents.
Unless otherwise indicated
 all references to &ldquo;dollars&rdquo; in this Form 10-K are to U.S. dollars. There were no cash
equivalents at December 31
 2019 or December 31
 2018.

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes
&rdquo; which requires that the Company
recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
tax bases of assets and liabilities
 using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred
income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance
is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The
Company has adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10-05 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The ASC clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&rsquo;s financial statements. The ASC prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. The ASC provides guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods
disclosure and transition. Open tax years
 subject to IRS examination include 2014 &ndash; 2019.

Net
Loss Per Share
 basic and diluted

For
the year ended December 2019
 the basic loss per share was computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding. Shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants (10
857
737)
 shares
convertible for debt (2
083
333) and shares outstanding but not yet issued (13
000
986) have been excluded as a common stock equivalent
in the diluted loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

For
the year ended December 2018
 basic loss per share has been computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants (17
265
893)
have been excluded as a common stock equivalent in the diluted loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

Derivative
Instruments&#9;

The
Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815

(&ldquo;ASC 815&rdquo;)

 including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
 and for hedging activities. They require that an entity recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.

If
certain conditions are met
 a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge
 the objective of which is to match the timing
of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged
asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction.
For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument
 the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change. The
Company did not have any derivative liabilities as of December 31

to our Financial Statements herein below for discussion regarding convertible notes payable and warrants.


    
    


Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

Effective
January 1
 2008
 fair value measurements are determined by the Company&rsquo;s adoption of authoritative guidance issued by the
FASB
 with the exception of the application of the statement to non-recurring
 non-financial assets and liabilities
 as permitted.
Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was established
 which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into
three levels as follows:

Level
1 &ndash; Valuation based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level
2 &ndash; Valuation based on
 observable inputs (other than level one prices)
 quoted market prices for similar assets such as
at the measurement date; quoted prices in the market that are not active; or other inputs that are observable
 either directly
or indirectly.

Level
3 &ndash; Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity
 therefore requiring management&rsquo;s
best estimate of what market participants would use as fair value.

The
following table represents the Company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities by level measured at fair value on a recurring basis at
December 31
 2019 and 2018:



    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
103
476


The
following assets and liabilities are measured on the balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis utilizing significant unobservable
inputs or Level 3 assumptions in their valuation. The following tables provide a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances
of the liabilities:

All
gains and losses on assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 within the fair
value hierarchy are recognized in other interest income&nbsp;and expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

&nbsp;The
change in the notes payable at fair value for the year ended December 31

Stock
Based Compensation

The
Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 718-10
 (&ldquo;ASC 718-10&rdquo;) which requires
that all share-based payments to both employees and non-employees be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.
At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company did not have any outstanding stock options.


    
    


Concentration
and Credit Risk

Financial
instruments and related items
 which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash.
The Company places its cash with high credit quality institutions. At times
 such&nbsp;deposits may be in excess of the FDIC insurance
limit of $250
000. The Company did not have cash on deposit in excess of such limit on December 31
 2019 and 2018.

Research
and Development

The
Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10

and Development
 all research and development costs must be charged to expense
as incurred. Accordingly
 internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and development
costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved as defined under the
applicable agreement. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed
in the period incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $441
320 and $630
518 during the years ended
December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Issuance
of Common Stock

The
issuance of common stock for other than cash is recorded by the Company at market values based on the closing price of the stock
on the date of any such grant.

Impact
of New Accounting Standards

Management
does not believe that any recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncements
 if adopted
 would have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 the
fair value attributable to a discount on the debt is $107
880 for the period ended December 31

payable increased to 18% per annum on April 1
 2018. On July 24
 2019
 the holder noticed the Company of its intent to convert
and the note was converted to 3
906
610 shares of Class A common stock.

NOTE
6 &ndash; OTHER NOTES PAYABLE

The
Company issued a $166
667 convertible promissory note bearing interest at 4.50% per annum to an accredited investor
 payable in
equal installments of $6
000 commencing February 1
 2018 plus interest at rate of 4% per annum on December 20
 2018 and $80
000
plus accrued interest on December 20
 2019. The holder has the right to convert the note into common stock of the Company at a
conversion price of $0.08 per share for each one dollar of cash payment which may be due
 (which would be 1
083
333 shares for
the $86
667 payment and 1
000
000 shares for the $80
000 payment). As of December 20
 2018
 a material event of default occurred
for breach of payment. The holder has the right to convert and has indicated that it might convert under settlement discussions

our Financial Statements.

The
Company evaluated the terms of the convertible note in accordance with ASC 815-40
 Contracts in Entity&rsquo;s Own Equity
 and
concluded that the Convertible Note did not resulted in a derivative. The Company evaluated the terms of the convertible note
and concluded that there was a beneficial conversion feature since the convertible note was convertible into shares of common
stock at a discount to the market value of the common stock. The discount related to the beneficial conversion feature on the
note was valued at $27
083 based on the $0.013 difference between the market price of $0.093 and the conversion price of $0.08
times the 2
083
325 conversion shares. As a result of the event of default
 the discount related to the beneficial conversion
feature has been extinguished for the balance of 2018
 and until the event of default is cured or the note is converted to common
shares.

The
Company issued a $150
000 convertible promissory note January 16
 2018 bearing interest at 4.50% per annum to an accredited investor
the Greer Family Trust (&ldquo;Trust&rdquo;)
 payable in equal installments of $6
000 plus accrued interest until the principal
and accrued interest are paid in full. The note provided the Trust a right to convert the note into common stock of the Company
at a conversion price of equal to seventy percent (70%) of the prior twenty (20) days average closing market price of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock. As of April 1
 2018
 only one $6
000 payment had been made
 creating a material event of default. At which time
the default interest rate became 18%. The Company accrued such default interest since the default.

On
July 25
 2019
 a Trustee for the Trust sent notice to the Company of their election to convert all unpaid principal and accrued
interest of $183
220 due under the note. The conversion price as calculated according to the note&rsquo;s terms is $0.0469 per
share
 resulting in a conversion of the Note and accrued interest into 3
906
610 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. These
shares were issued in the first quarter of 2020.

The
Company evaluated the terms of the original convertible note in accordance with ASC 815-40
 Contracts in Entity&rsquo;s Own Equity
and concluded that the Convertible Note resulted in a derivative. The discount related to the beneficial conversion feature on
the note was valued at $58
495 based on the difference between the fair value of the 1
578
947 convertible shares at the
valuation date and the $150
000 note value. The discount related to the beneficial conversion feature was being amortized over

Model
 2018
 the remaining discount was fully amortized. The derivative liability for this
note at July 25
 2019 and December 31
 2018 was $168
375 and $103
476 respectively
 calculated as described in Note 3 under the



    
    





    
July 25

                                                                                
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    


Due
to the conversion of the convertible note on July 25
 2019
 the Company wrote off the total $168
375 derivative liability as of
the conversion date
 recording a $64
899 loss in the fair value of a derivative for the year ended December 31
 2019.

NOTE
9 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

After
approval during a properly called special meeting of the board of directors
 on September 14
 2018 Mabert
 LLC
 a Texas Limited
Liability Company owned by a director and stockholder
 Kevin Jones and his wife Christine Early
 as an Agent for various private
lenders including themselves
 entered into a loan agreement (&ldquo;Loan Agreement&rdquo;) for the purpose of funding working
capital and general corporate expenses for the Company of up to $1
500
000
 which was subsequently amended to provide up to $5
000
000.
The Company bylaws provide no bar from transactions with Interested Directors
 so long as the interested party does not vote on
such transaction. Mr. Jones as an Interested Director did not vote on this transaction. Since the inception of the Loan Agreement
through December 31
 2019
 a total of $2
031
056 (excluding debt discount of $107
880) has been loaned to the Company by six shareholders
including Mr. Jones. 

Through
Mabert
 Mr. Jones along with his wife and his company have loaned $1
426
056
 and four other shareholders have loaned the balance
of the Mabert Loans. These loans are secured by the assets of the Company. A financing statement and UCC-1 have been filed according
to Texas statutes. Should a default under the loan agreement occur
 there could be a foreclosure or a bankruptcy proceeding filed
by the Agent for these shareholders. The actions of the Company in case of default can only be determined by the shareholders.
A foreclosure sale or distribution through bankruptcy could only result in the creditors receiving a pro rata payment based upon
the terms of the loan agreement. Mabert did not nor will it receive compensation for its work as an agent for the lenders.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company accrued expenses for related parties of $1
369
389 to account for the total deferred
compensation expenses among three current executives
 one former executive and one current employee. Each of the current executives
and employees have agreed to defer their compensation until such time as sufficient cash is available to make such payments
 the
Company&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officer having the express authority to determine what constitutes cash sufficiency from time-to-time.

In
the year ended December 31
 2019
 we received $51
019 in advances from three of our directors
 Ransom Jones
 Kent Harer and Kevin
Jones
 in the amounts of $25
000
 $25
000 and $1
019 respectively
 which have been accrued as Advances - related parties for the
period.

During
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company advanced $387
847 to OPMGE
 an affiliate that
 as reported on Form 8-K on August
29
 2019
 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 the Company now owns a non-consolidating 42.86% interest
 for expenses related
to operating the OPMGE GTL plant located in Wharton
 Texas. The amount advanced was booked as a related party receivable by the
Company which expects to fully recover the receivable from OPMGE as it ramps up its operations in 2020.

NOTE
10 &ndash; INCOME TAXES

The
Company has not filed its corporate tax returns since fiscal 2016.

Due
to recurring losses
 the Company&rsquo;s tax provision for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 was $0.

The
difference between the effective income tax rate and the applicable statutory federal income tax rate is summarized as follows:

At
December 31
 2019 and 2018 the Company&rsquo;s deferred tax assets were as follows:

As
of December 31
 2019
 the Company had unused net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $30.1 million available to reduce
future federal taxable income. Net operating loss carryforwards of $23.6 million expire through fiscal years ending 2037
 and
6.5 million may be carried forward indefinitely. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the amount of taxable
income that can be offset by carryforwards after a change in control (generally a greater than 50% change in ownership).

The
Company&rsquo;s ability to offset future taxable income
 if any
 with tax net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due
to the non-filing of tax returns and the impact of the statute of limitations on the Company&rsquo;s ability to claim such benefits.
Furthermore
 changes in ownership may result in limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Due to these limitations
and other considerations
 management has established full valuation allowances on deferred tax assets relating to net operating
loss carryforward
 as the realization of any future benefits from these assets is uncertain. The change in the valuation allowance
was $5
469
078 and $233
037 for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

In
the August 2012 acquisition agreement with Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc. (&ldquo;GIE&rdquo;)
 the Company agreed to: (i) issue
an additional 7
500
000 shares of restricted common stock when the first portable GTL unit is built and becomes operational
 and
is capable of producing 2
000 barrels of diesel or jet fuel per day
 and (ii) pay a 2% royalty on all gross production sales on
each unit placed in production. In connection with a settlement agreement with the Greer Family Trust (&lsquo;Trust&rdquo;)
 the
successor owner of one of the two founders and prior owners of GIE on February 6
 2018
 the Company exchanged Greer&rsquo;s half
of the 7
500
000 shares (3
750
000 shares) to be issued in the future
 Greer&rsquo;s half of the 2% royalty
 a termination of
Greer&rsquo;s then current Employment Agreement and the Trust&rsquo;s waiver of any future claims against the Company for any
reason
 for the issuance and delivery to the Trust of three million (3
000
000) restricted shares of the Company&rsquo;s common
stock and a convertible Promissory Note for $150
000. As a result
 only 3
750
000 common shares are committed to be later issued
under the original 2012 acquisition agreement.

The
Company has accrued management fees of $1
301
964 related to separation agreements and settlement expenses for two prior executives
of the Company
 Richard Halden and Randy Moseley
 who both resigned from their respective management positions in 2016
 with Halden
then further resigning as a director from our Board of Directors in Feb 2017. Although we have not maintained currency with respect
to the contractual payment obligations therein
 both former employees are greater than five percent shareholders and had agreed
to defer payments until such time as we have sufficient available liquidity to begin making payments on a regular basis. In March
of this year
 Halden filed suit against the Company alleging claims arising from his severance and release agreement between the
parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&rsquo;s fees. The Company answered the lawsuit
and asserted a number of affirmative defenses; subsequently
 the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on November 19
 2019.
Other than an increase in our legal expenses related to defending against Halden&rsquo;s lawsuit
 and given the subsequent dismissal
of the same
 we expect no further material financial impacts from such accrued fees until any such regular payments are able to
begin
 or another form of settlement is reached.

Consulting
Agreements

On
November 28
 2017
 the Company entered into a three-year consulting agreement with Chisos for public relations
 consulting and
corporate communications services. The initial payment was 1
800
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s restricted common stock. Additional
payments were to be made upon the Company&rsquo;s common stock reaching certain price points over an extended period. Due to a
breach of the Agreement by Chisos
 on June 22
 2018
 the Board of Directors of the Company voted to terminate the Agreement. Based
on the termination
 all warrants to purchase the Company&rsquo;s common stock were cancelled. Chisos sued the Company for breach
of contract. The Company vigorously defended itself and the litigation was dismissed without prejudice on November 19

In
February 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). The updated
guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most operating leases. In addition
 the updated
guidance requires that lessors separate lease and non-lease components in a contract in accordance with the new revenue guidance
in ASC 606. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. The Company
adopted this guidance effective January 1
 2019 and noted that the leases discussed below did meet the requirements for recording
a right of use asset or liability under ASC-842 given that they were short term leases.

In
October 2015
 the Company entered into a two-year lease for approximately 1
800 square feet a base rate of $2
417 per month. The
Company terminated the lease effective August 31
 2018 and has no further financial obligations under the lease.

Legal
Matters

The
Company was named as a co-defendant in an action brought against the Company and Mamaki Tea
 Inc.
 alleging
 among other things
that the Company was named as a co-guarantor on an $850
000 foreclosed note
 including accrued and accruing interest held by Southwest
Capital Funding
&rdquo;). On April 22
 2016
 Greenway Technologies filed suit under Cause No. DC-16-004718
in the 193rd District Court
 Dallas County
 Texas against Mamaki of Hawaii
 Inc. (&ldquo;Mamaki&rdquo;)
 Hawaiian Beverages
 Inc.(&ldquo;HBI&rdquo;)
Curtis Borman and Lee Jenison for breach of a Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 29
 2015
 wherein the Company sold its shares
in Mamaki to HBI for $700
000 (along with the assumption of certain debt). The Company maintained its guaranty on the original
loan as a component of the sale transaction. The Defendants failed to make payments of $150
000 each on November 30
 2015
 December
28
 2015 and January 27
 2016. On January 13
 2017
 the parties executed a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (Agreement).
However
 the Defendants again defaulted in their payment obligations under this new Agreement. Curtis Borman and Lee Jennison
were co-guarantors of the obligations of Mamaki and HBI. To secure their guaranties
 each of Curtis Borman and Lee Jennsion posted
1
241
500 and 1
000
000 shares
 respectively
 of the Company. Under the Agreement
 the shares were valued at $.20. Due to the
default under the Agreement
 these shares were returned to the Company&rsquo;s treasury shares. Curtis Borman subsequently filed
for bankruptcy and the property was liquidated for $600
000
 applied against the prior loan amount
 leaving a remaining guaranteed
loan payment balance of approximately $700
000
 including accrued interest and legal fees. On September 26
 2019
 we entered into
a Settlement Agreement with Southwest
 providing 1
000
000 shares of Common Stock subject to standard Rule 144 restrictions
 and
a three (3) year term Promissory Note for $525
000 to settle all claims (recorded in Long Term Liabilities).


    
    


On
April 9
 2018
 the Company and Tonaquint
 Inc. agreed to settle on Tonaquint&rsquo;s exercise of a warrant option with a one-time
issuance from Greenway Technologies of 1
600
000 shares of our common stock subject to a weekly leak out restriction equal to
the greater of $10
000 and 8% of the weekly trading volume. Such issuance of stock was completed in connection with a legal opinion
pursuant to Rule 144.

On
September 7
 2018
 Wildcat
 a company controlled by a shareholder Gleason
 filed suit against the Company
 alleging claims arising
from a prior consulting agreement between the parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&rsquo;s
fees. On September 27
 2018
 Wildcat filed a second suit against the Company alleging claims arising from a Promissory Note between
the parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&rsquo;s fees. On February 13
 2019
 the
parties attended mediation which resulted in settlement discussions which resulted in a Rule 11 Agreement settling both disputes.
Pursuant to the Rule 11 Agreement
 the parties agreed to abate both cases until the earlier of a default of the performance of
the Rule 11 Agreement or October 30
 2019. The Rule 11 Agreement was drafted to allow the Parties time to draft and sign the Wildcat
Settlement Agreement
 to make payments due on or before October 15
 2019
 and to allow for the transfer of stock to effectuate
the terms of the Rule 11 Agreement. The material terms of the Rule 11 Agreement were as follows:



    
    
The Company agreed
    to execute a new Promissory Note to replace the original Promissory Note
 effective November 13
 2017
 the effective date
    of the original note. The new Promissory Note has a maturity date of March 1
 2020 and provides for four equal payments of
    principal through such date
 and accrued interest at 10% upon maturity. The Company made the three payments due through December
    2019
 and made the final payment in March 2020
 thereby extinguishing such Promissory Note. 

    
    
    

    
    
The Company agreed
    to pay $300
000 in settlement of the prior Consulting Agreement in 60 installments of $5
000 each month
 until paid in full.
    The $300
000 payable was accrued as of December 31
 2018
 of which $40
000 has been paid through the period ending December
    31
 2019.

    
    
    

    
    
The Parties agreed
    to amend the existing Overriding Royalty Agreement (&ldquo;ORRI&rdquo;) between the Company&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary
    Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc. (&ldquo;GIE&rdquo;)
 increasing Wildcat&rsquo;s royalties from .25% (1/4 of 1%) to .375%

The Company agreed
    to pay Wildcat&rsquo;s legal fees related to these matters
 capped at $60
000
 in three installments of $20
000 on June 1
    August 1
 and October 1

500
000 restricted shares of its Common Stock on or before October 15
 2019
 in consideration of the Promissory
    Note
 in exchange for extinguishment of all prior granted warrants and to complete the grant of 1
000
000 shares not received
    from a prior transaction. The Company issued such 1
500
000 restricted shares and the expense for such issuance was accrued
    on the Company&rsquo;s Balance Sheet on the effective date of the Rule 11 Agreement and increased by $45
000 based upon the
    actual value of the shares on the date of issuance for the period ending December 31

The

 2019
 the Parties would file a Joint
Motion for Dismissal and present Agreed Orders of Dismissal with prejudice for both lawsuits.

The
Company performed in all regards under the Rule 11 Agreement
 however Gleason refused to sign the Wildcat Settlement Agreement
at the point of the Company&rsquo;s having performed its obligations. The parties&rsquo; respective counsels then mutually agreed
to extend the original October 15
 2019 settlement date until at least the end of the year while the parties waited for Gleason&rsquo;s
signature. Gleason signed the Compromise Settlement and Release Agreement on February 4
 2020
 and all litigation was dismissed
by the Court on February 25
 2020.

 Chisos
 a company controlled by dissident shareholder Halden
 filed suit against the Company
 alleging claims
arising from a consulting agreement between the parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&rsquo;s
fees. The Company answered the lawsuit and asserted a number of affirmative defenses; subsequently
 the lawsuit was dismissed
without prejudice on November 19
 2019.

 2019
 dissident shareholder Halden in his capacity as an individual
 filed suit against the Company alleging claims

 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
court costs
 and attorney&rsquo;s fees. The Company answered the lawsuit and asserted a number of affirmative defenses; subsequently
the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on November 19
 2019.

On
March 26
 2019
 the Company filed a verified petition for Declaratory Judgement
 Ex Parte Application for a Temporary Restraining
Order and Application for Injunctive Relief against the members of a dissident shareholders group (including Halden) named the
&ldquo;Greenway Shareholders Committee&rdquo; in Dallas County. A Temporary Restraining Order was issued by the court enjoining
the Defendants (and their officers
 agents
 servants
 employees and attorneys) and those persons in active concert or participation
from; holding the special shareholders meeting on April 4
 2019 or calling such meeting to order; attending or participating in
the Special Meeting; voting the shares of Plaintiff owned by any Defendant at the Special Meeting
 either directly or by granting
a proxy to allow a non-defendant to vote said shares; voting any shares of Plaintiff owned by non-defendants with or by proxy
at the Special Meeting; and serving as chairman at the Special Meeting. On April 8
 2019
 the court issued such Temporary Injunction
against the dissident shareholders who received notice. The Injunction continued until the trial date of December 10
 2019; no
trial was held and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on November 26
 2019.

On
October 19
 2019 the Company was served with a lawsuit by Norman Reynolds
 a previously engaged counsel by the Company. The suit
was filed in Harris County District Court
 Houston
 Texas
 asserting claims for unpaid fees of $90
378. While fully reserved
Greenway vigorously disputes the total amount claimed. Greenway has asserted counterclaims based upon alleged conflicts of interest
breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (&ldquo;DTPA&rdquo;). Greenway is confident
in its defenses and counterclaims and intends to vigorously defend its interests and prosecute its claims.

breach by Buyer of the provisions of this Section 4.i
 that the Company shall be entitled
 in addition to all other available
remedies
 to an injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate cessation of any Prohibited Transaction
 without the

 the Company shall provide

provision to that the Company will cause its transfer agent to reserve shares of Common Stock in the Reserved Amount (as defined
in the Note)) signed by the successor transfer agent to Company and the Company.



    
    


b.
. Prior to registration of the Conversion Shares under the 1933 Act or the date on which the Conversion
Shares may be sold pursuant to an exemption from registration
 all such certificates shall bear the Legend specified in Section
2.g of this Agreement.

c.
. The Company warrants that: (i) no instruction other than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions
will be given by the Company to its transfer agent and that the Securities shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books
and records of the Company as and to the extent provided in this Agreement and the Note; (ii) the Company will not (1) direct
its transfer agent to not transfer or (2) delay
 impair
 or hinder its transfer agent in transferring (or issuing)(electronically
or in certificated form) any certificate for Conversion Shares to be issued to Buyer upon Conversion of or otherwise pursuant
to the Note as and when required by the Note and this Agreement; and (iii) the Company will not (1) fail to remove
 (2) direct
its transfer agent not to remove
 or (3) impair
 delay
 or hinder its transfer agent from removing a restrictive legend
 if permitted
by applicable securities laws
 (or to withdraw any stop transfer instructions in respect thereof) on any certificate for any Conversion
Shares issued to Buyer upon Conversion of or otherwise pursuant to the Note as and when required by the Note or this Agreement.
If Buyer provides the Company with an opinion of counsel
 in the form attached hereto as 
 or in form substance
and scope satisfactory to the Company and to its transfer agent (x) at the time of the Conversion of such shares of Common Stock;
and (y) at the time of the sale of the underlying Common Stock issued upon a Conversion
 if such Conversion occurs less than one
year after the Closing Date; and: (A) the Filing Date occurs following such Conversion
 and the sale of share underlying such
Conversion occurs on or following such Filing Date; or (B) the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC; to the effect that the shares
of Common Stock to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration
 then the
Company shall permit the transfer
 and
 in the case of the Conversion Shares
 promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one
or more certificates
 free from restrictive legend
 in such name and in such denominations as specified by Buyer. The Company
acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to Buyer
 by vitiating the intent and
purpose of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly
 the Company acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of
its obligations under this Section 5 may be inadequate and agrees
 in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Company
of the provisions of this Section
 that Buyer shall be entitled
 in addition to all other available remedies
 to an injunction
restraining any breach and requiring immediate transfer
 without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or
other security being required.

Re:
XYZ CORP.

Ladies
and Gentlemen:

We
have acted as special counsel to POWER UP LENDING GROUP LTD. (&ldquo;Seller&rdquo;). We have been asked to provide an opinion
in connection with the issuance (the &ldquo;Issuance&rdquo;) without restrictive legend of XXX
XXX shares (the &ldquo;Shares&rdquo;)
of the common stock
 $0.0001 par value per share
 of Greenway Technologies
 Inc.
 a Texas corporation (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) under the Securities Act of 1933
as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;) with respect to the conversion of a certain convertible note dated January 24
 2020
by the Company in favor of Seller (the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;) and the conversion notice delivered pursuant to the Note dated the
date hereof (the &ldquo;Conversion Notice&rdquo;).

Specifically
we have been asked to opine whether shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock to be issued in conversion of the Note pursuant
to the Conversion Notice are &ldquo;restricted securities&rdquo; as that term is defined in Rule 144 (&ldquo;Rule 144&rdquo;)
promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act.

The
opinion expressed in this letter is limited solely to this issue of the Shares
 premised upon the federal securities laws of the
United States as of the date of this letter
 and based upon the facts as presented to us contained within the instruments we have
examined. We have conducted an independent investigation into the underlying facts presented to us recited below and contained
in the documents listed below.



    
    


In
connection with preparing this letter
 we have prepared and re-examined and relied upon: (a) the Note
 dated January 24
 2020
executed by the Company; (b) the Securities Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and the Seller dated January 24
 2020
(the &ldquo;Purchase Agreement&rdquo; and collectively with the Note and any ancillary documents in connection with the Note
the &ldquo;Transaction Documents); (c) the Conversion Notice from the Seller dated the date hereof; (d) a representation letter
executed by the Seller dated the date hereof; and (e) a limited review of the most recent filing of the Company with the Commission
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;).



We
have received a representation letter from the Seller that
 among other things
 represent to us the following facts
 which we
have assumed
 and conducted an independent investigation and determined that such representations
 are true
 correct and complete:
(i) on January 24
 2020
 the Company issued the Note to the Seller in the amount of $118
000.00; (ii) on January 24
 2020 (the
&ldquo;Closing Date&rdquo;)
 the Seller advanced the funds to the Company with respect to the Note and the Note was fully paid
as of such date; (iii) the Seller is not an &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; of the Company as defined in Rule 144(a)(1); and (iv) the
Seller does not know of any material adverse information about the Company or its prospects which has not been publicly disclosed.
Furthermore
 a limited review of the Company&rsquo;s most recent filings with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act indicate
that: (i) the Company is a fully-reporting company under the Exchange Act; and (ii) the Company has filed all reports (our review
is specifically limited to quarterly and annual reports) required under the Exchange Act with the Commission for the preceding
twelve months.



Based
on the facts presented to us
 the Seller&rsquo;s holding period for the Note as determined by Rule 144(d) began when the Seller
provided full consideration for the Note. In this instance
 the Seller has represented to us that the Note was fully paid on or
before January 24
 2020.

In
order for the Seller to convert the Note into the Shares free of restrictions under Rule 144
 the Issuance must meet the requirements
of Rule 144(b)(1)
 which determines the requirements for restrictions on securities for non-affiliates. Specifically
 under Rule
144(b)(1)
 the issuance of the Shares to the Seller without restriction must either meet or be exempt from the requirements of
Rule 144(c) and 144(d). Based on a limited review of the Company&rsquo;s most recent filings with the Commission
 the Company
meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144(c).

Pursuant
to Rule 144(d)(3)(ii)
 the holding period for securities issued in conversion of other securities of the same Company is deemed
to have begun at the same time as the securities surrendered for conversion. Therefore
 the Seller&rsquo;s holding period is deemed
to begin on the date that the Note was fully paid which was on or before January 24
 2020.



    
    




Therefore
based upon the foregoing discussion
 the Shares issued to the Seller pursuant to the Conversion Notice are not &ldquo;restricted
securities&rdquo; as defined in Rule 144 and should be issued to the Seller without any restrictive legend.

The
opinions expressed in this letter are premised upon the facts and circumstances as represented to us by the Seller and as made
in the documents referred to above
 on which we have relied
 without investigation. We also assume that the Seller will not become
an &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; of the Company at any time that the Seller owns any of the Shares.

We
are members of the bar of the State of New York and are not licensed or admitted to practice law in any other jurisdiction. Accordingly
we express no opinion with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York and the federal
laws of the United States. Furthermore
 we express no opinion regarding any federal or state law not specified expressly in this
letter.

We
assume no obligation to advise you of any changes to this opinion which may come to our attention after the date hereof. This
opinion may not be relied upon or furnished to any other person except the addressee hereof without the express written consent
of this firm.



Very truly yours

Re:
XYZ CORP.

Ladies
and Gentlemen:

We
have acted as special counsel to POWER UP LENDING GROUP LTD. (&ldquo;Seller&rdquo;). We have been asked to provide an opinion
in connection with the issuance (the &ldquo;Issuance&rdquo;) without restrictive legend of XXX
XXX shares (the &ldquo;Shares&rdquo;)
of the common stock
 $0.0001 par value per share
 of Greenway Technologies
 Inc.
 a Texas corporation (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) under the Securities Act of 1933
as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;) with respect to the conversion of a certain convertible note dated [*]
 2020
 by
the Company in favor of Seller (the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;) and the conversion notice delivered pursuant to the Note dated the date
hereof (the &ldquo;Conversion Notice&rdquo;).

Specifically
we have been asked to opine whether shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock to be issued in conversion of the Note pursuant
to the Conversion Notice are &ldquo;restricted securities&rdquo; as that term is defined in Rule 144 (&ldquo;Rule 144&rdquo;)
promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act.

The
opinion expressed in this letter is limited solely to this issue of the Shares
 premised upon the federal securities laws of the
United States as of the date of this letter
 and based upon the facts as presented to us contained within the instruments we have
examined. We have conducted an independent investigation into the underlying facts presented to us recited below and contained
in the documents listed below.


    
    


In
connection with preparing this letter
 we have prepared and re-examined and relied upon: (a) the Note
 dated [*]
 2020
 executed
by the Company; (b) the Securities Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and the Seller dated [*]
 2020 (the &ldquo;Purchase
Agreement&rdquo; and collectively with the Note and any ancillary documents in connection with the Note
 the &ldquo;Transaction
Documents); (c) the Conversion Notice from the Seller dated the date hereof; (d) a representation letter executed by the Seller
dated the date hereof; and (e) a limited review of the most recent filing of the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities
Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;).



We
have received a representation letter from the Seller that
 among other things
 represent to us the following facts
 which we
have assumed
 and conducted an independent investigation and determined that such representations
 are true
 correct and complete:
(i) on [*]. 2020
 the Company issued the Note to the Seller in the amount of $118
000.00; (ii) on [*]
 2020 (the &ldquo;Closing
Date&rdquo;)
 the Seller advanced the funds to the Company with respect to the Note and the Note was fully paid as of such date;
(iii) the Seller is not an &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; of the Company as defined in Rule 144(a)(1); and (iv) the Seller does not know
of any material adverse information about the Company or its prospects which has not been publicly disclosed. Furthermore
 a limited
review of the Company&rsquo;s most recent filings with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act indicate that: (i) the Company
is a fully-reporting company under the Exchange Act; and (ii) the Company has filed all reports (our review is specifically limited
to quarterly and annual reports) required under the Exchange Act with the Commission for the preceding twelve months.



Based
on the facts presented to us
 the Seller&rsquo;s holding period for the Note as determined by Rule 144(d) began when the Seller
provided full consideration for the Note. In this instance
 the Seller has represented to us that the Note was fully paid on or
before [*]
 2020.

In
order for the Seller to convert the Note into the Shares free of restrictions under Rule 144
 the Issuance must meet the requirements
of Rule 144(b)(1)
 which determines the requirements for restrictions on securities for non-affiliates. Specifically
 under Rule
144(b)(1)
 the issuance of the Shares to the Seller without restriction must either meet or be exempt from the requirements of
Rule 144(c) and 144(d). Based on a limited review of the Company&rsquo;s most recent filings with the Commission
 the Company
meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144(c).

Pursuant
to Rule 144(d)(3)(ii)
 the holding period for securities issued in conversion of other securities of the same Company is deemed
to have begun at the same time as the securities surrendered for conversion. Therefore
 the Seller&rsquo;s holding period is deemed
to begin on the date that the Note was fully paid which was on or before [*]
 2020.


    
    




Therefore
based upon the foregoing discussion
 the Shares issued to the Seller pursuant to the Conversion Notice are not &ldquo;restricted
securities&rdquo; as defined in Rule 144 and should be issued to the Seller without any restrictive legend.

The
opinions expressed in this letter are premised upon the facts and circumstances as represented to us by the Seller and as made
in the documents referred to above
 on which we have relied
 without investigation. We also assume that the Seller will not become
an &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; of the Company at any time that the Seller owns any of the Shares.

We
are members of the bar of the State of New York and are not licensed or admitted to practice law in any other jurisdiction. Accordingly
we express no opinion with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York and the federal
laws of the United States. Furthermore
 we express no opinion regarding any federal or state law not specified expressly in this
letter.

We
assume no obligation to advise you of any changes to this opinion which may come to our attention after the date hereof. This
opinion may not be relied upon or furnished to any other person except the addressee hereof without the express written consent
of this firm.

Very
truly yours

 New York time)
and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b)
 surrendering this Note to Borrower at the principal office of Borrower (upon payment in full

(b)
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein
 upon Conversion of this Note
in accordance with the terms hereof
 the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to Borrower unless the
entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is converted. The Holder and Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal

 surrender of this Note) in accordance with
the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement. Upon receipt by Borrower of a Notice of Conversion
 the Holder shall be deemed to
be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such Conversion
 and the outstanding principal amount due under this
Note and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such Conversion. Unless Borrower defaults
on Borrower&rsquo;s obligations hereunder
 all rights with respect to the portion of this Note converted shall forthwith terminate
except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities
 cash or other assets

 upon such Conversion.

to Borrower
 and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of Borrower to the Holder
in connection with such Conversion.

Fast Automated Securities Transfer program
 Holder may request that in lieu of Borrower delivering physical certificates to Holder
representing the Common Stock issuable upon Conversion
 Borrower use its best efforts to cause the Common Stock issuable upon
Conversion to be electronically transmitted and credited to the Holder&rsquo;s primary broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal
Agent Commission system; provided
 that the Holder shall make any such request in writing to Borrower.


    
    


(e)
. Without in any way limiting the Holder&rsquo;s right to pursue other
remedies
 including actual damages or equitable relief
 the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon Conversion
is not delivered by the Deadline due to action or inaction of Borrower
 Borrower shall pay to the Holder $500.00 per day in cash
provided;
i.e.

transfer agent; and not the result of any failure to pay such transfer agent) despite the best efforts of Borrower to effect delivery
of such Common Stock. The Fee shall paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it accrues. Borrower
agrees that the Conversion Right is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure
 attempt to frustrate
or interference with the Conversion Right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly
 the parties acknowledge that
the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(e) are justified.

(f)
. Borrower shall remain current in all amounts owed to its transfer agent and in good standing
with its transfer agent. In the event that Borrower is not current in all amounts owed to its transfer agent
 then at the option
of the Holder
 the Holder may advance any funds to Borrower&rsquo;s transfer agent so that transfer agent will process the requested
Conversion. Such advanced funds shall be paid by Borrower to the Holder within 48 hours of a written demand from the Holder.

A

 Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc.
 is primarily&#13;engaged in the research
 development and commercialization of a proprietary Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) syngas conversion system that&#13;can be economically scaled to meet individual natural gas field/resource requirements. The Company&amp;#8217;s proprietary and patented&#13;technology has now been realized in Greenway&amp;#8217;s recently completed first generation commercial-scale G-ReformerTM refractory&#13;unit
 a unique and critical component to the Company&amp;#8217;s overall GTL technology solution. Greenway&amp;#8217;s objective is to&#13;become a material direct and licensed producer of renewable GTL synthesized gasoline
 diesel and jet fuels

 Greenway Technologies acquired&#13;100% of Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc. (&amp;#8220;GIE&amp;#8221;) which owns patents and trade secrets for a proprietary technology&#13;to convert natural gas into synthesis gas (&amp;#8220;syngas&amp;#8221;). Based on its breakthrough process called Fractional Thermal Oxidation&amp;#8482;&#13;(&amp;#8220;FTO&amp;#8221;)
 the Company believes that the G-Reformer
 combined with conventional Fischer-Tropsch (&amp;#8220;FT&amp;#8221;) processes

&#13;Greenway announced in August 2019 that it had entered into an agreement to partially own and operate an existing GTL plant located&#13;in Wharton
 Texas. Originally acquired by Mabert
 a company controlled by director
 Kevin Jones
 members include OPMGE (a company&#13;formed to facilitate the joint venture)
 Mabert and Tom Phillips
 an employee of the Company. The Company&amp;#8217;s involvement in&#13;the venture is intended to facilitate third-party certification of the Company&amp;#8217;s G-Reformer technology
 related equipment&#13;and technology. In addition
 the Company anticipates that OPMGE&amp;#8217;s operations will demonstrate that the G-Reformer is a commercially&#13;viable technology for producing syngas and marketable fuel products. As the first operating GTL plant to use Greenway&amp;#8217;s proprietary&#13;reforming technology and equipment

 have a larger footprint and cannot be easily deployed&#13;at field sites to process associated gas
 stranded gas
 coal-bed methane
 vented gas
 or flared gas

 expected to be later reduced to a 30% interest upon the completion of certain expected&#13;third-party investments for the remining 300 of 1

The Company evaluated the terms of the convertible note and concluded that there was a beneficial conversion feature&#13;since the convertible note was convertible into shares of common stock at a discount to the market value of the common stock. The&#13;discount related to the beneficial conversion feature on the note was valued at $27
083 based on the $0.013 difference between&#13;the market price of $0.093 and the conversion price of $0.08 times the 2

 the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying&#13;amount of the assets exceeds its fair value. If estimated fair value is less than the book value
 the asset is written down to&#13;the estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. There were no long-lived assets or impairment charges for the year&#13;ended December 31

 Richard Halden and&#13;Randy Moseley
 who both resigned from their respective management positions in 2016
 with Halden then further resigning as a director&#13;from our Board of Directors in Feb 2017. Although we have not maintained currency with respect to the contractual payment obligations&#13;therein
 both former employees are greater than five percent shareholders and had agreed to defer payments until such time as we&#13;have sufficient available liquidity to begin making payments on a regular basis. In March of this year
 Halden filed suit against&#13;the Company alleging claims arising from his severance and release agreement between the parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
&#13;interest
 court costs
 and attorney&amp;#8217;s fees. The Company answered the lawsuit and asserted a number of affirmative defenses;&#13;subsequently
 the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on November 19
 2019. Other than an increase in our legal expenses related&#13;to defending against Halden&amp;#8217;s lawsuit
 and given the subsequent dismissal of the same
 we expect no further material financial&#13;impacts from such accrued fees until any such regular payments are able to begin

 2017
 the Company entered into&#13;a three-year consulting agreement with Chisos for public relations
 consulting and corporate communications services. The initial&#13;payment was 1
800
000 shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s restricted common stock. Additional payments were to be made upon the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;common stock reaching certain price points over an extended period. Due to a breach of the Agreement by Chisos
 on June 22
 2018
&#13;the Board of Directors of the Company voted to terminate the Agreement. Based on the termination
 all warrants to purchase the&#13;Company&amp;#8217;s common stock were cancelled. Chisos sued the Company for breach of contract. The Company vigorously defended itself&#13;and the litigation was dismissed without prejudice on November 19

 the Financial Accounting&#13;Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). The updated guidance requires lessees to recognize&#13;lease assets and lease liabilities for most operating leases. In addition
 the updated guidance requires that lessors separate&#13;lease and non-lease components in a contract in accordance with the new revenue guidance in ASC 606. This guidance is effective&#13;for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. The Company adopted this guidance effective January&#13;1

 Inc. (&amp;#8220;Mamaki&amp;#8221;)
 Hawaiian Beverages
 Inc.(&amp;#8220;HBI&amp;#8221;)
 Curtis Borman and Lee Jenison&#13;for breach of a Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 29
 2015
 wherein the Company sold its shares in Mamaki to HBI for $700
000&#13;(along with the assumption of certain debt). The Company maintained its guaranty on the original loan as a component of the sale&#13;transaction. The Defendants failed to make payments of $150
000 each on November 30
 2015
 December 28
 2015 and January 27
 2016.&#13;On January 13
 2017
 the parties executed a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (Agreement). However
 the Defendants again&#13;defaulted in their payment obligations under this new Agreement. Curtis Borman and Lee Jennison were co-guarantors of the obligations&#13;of Mamaki and HBI. To secure their guaranties
 each of Curtis Borman and Lee Jennsion posted 1
241
500 and 1
000
000 shares
 respectively
&#13;of the Company. Under the Agreement
 the shares were valued at $.20. Due to the default under the Agreement
 these shares were&#13;returned to the Company&amp;#8217;s treasury shares. Curtis Borman subsequently filed for bankruptcy and the property was liquidated&#13;for $600
000
 applied against the prior loan amount
 leaving a remaining guaranteed loan payment balance of approximately $700
000
&#13;including accrued interest and legal fees. On September 26
 2019
 we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Southwest
 providing&#13;1

 to make payments&#13;due on or before October 15
 2019

 effective November 13
 2017
 the effective date of the original note. The new Promissory Note has a maturity date of March 1

 and made the final payment in March 2020

 2019

 however Gleason refused to sign the Wildcat Settlement Agreement at the point of the Company&amp;#8217;s having&#13;performed its obligations. The parties&amp;#8217; respective counsels then mutually agreed to extend the original October 15
 2019&#13;settlement date until at least the end of the year while the parties waited for Gleason&amp;#8217;s signature. Gleason signed the Compromise&#13;Settlement and Release Agreement on February 4

 the Company had unused&#13;net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $30.1 million available to reduce future federal taxable income. Net operating&#13;loss carryforwards of $23.6 million expire through fiscal years ending 2037

 if any
 with tax net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to the non-filing&#13;of tax returns and the impact of the statute of limitations on the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to claim such benefits. Furthermore
&#13;changes in ownership may result in limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Due to these limitations
 and other considerations
&#13;management has established full valuation allowances on deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforward
 as the&#13;realization of any future benefits from these assets is uncertain. The change in the valuation allowance was $5

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]











 Inc.
 (&#8220;Greenway&#8221;
&#8220;GTI&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) through its wholly owned subsidiary
 Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc.
 is primarily
engaged in the research
 development and commercialization of a proprietary Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) syngas conversion system that
can be economically scaled to meet individual natural gas field/resource requirements. The Company&#8217;s proprietary and patented
technology has now been realized in Greenway&#8217;s recently completed first generation commercial-scale G-ReformerTM refractory
unit
 a unique and critical component to the Company&#8217;s overall GTL technology solution. Greenway&#8217;s objective is to
become a material direct and licensed producer of renewable GTL synthesized gasoline
 diesel and jet fuels
 with a near term focus
on U.S. market opportunities.




 Greenway Technologies acquired
100% of Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc. (&#8220;GIE&#8221;) which owns patents and trade secrets for a proprietary technology
to convert natural gas into synthesis gas (&#8220;syngas&#8221;). Based on its breakthrough process called Fractional Thermal Oxidation&#8482;
(&#8220;FTO&#8221;)
 the Company believes that the G-Reformer
 combined with conventional Fischer-Tropsch (&#8220;FT&#8221;) processes
offers an economical and scalable method to converting natural gas to liquid fuel.


Greenway announced in August 2019 that it had entered into an agreement to partially own and operate an existing GTL plant located
in Wharton
 Texas. Originally acquired by Mabert
 a company controlled by director
 Kevin Jones
 members include OPMGE (a company
formed to facilitate the joint venture)
 Mabert and Tom Phillips
 an employee of the Company. The Company&#8217;s involvement in
the venture is intended to facilitate third-party certification of the Company&#8217;s G-Reformer technology
 related equipment
and technology. In addition
 the Company anticipates that OPMGE&#8217;s operations will demonstrate that the G-Reformer is a commercially
viable technology for producing syngas and marketable fuel products. As the first operating GTL plant to use Greenway&#8217;s proprietary
reforming technology and equipment
 the Wharton joint venture facility is initially expected to yield a minimum of 75 - 100 barrels
per day of gasoline and diesel fuels from converted natural gas.


G-Reformer is a major innovation in gas reforming and GTL technology in general. Initial tests have demonstrated that the Company&#8217;s
solution appears to be superior to legacy technologies which are more costly
 have a larger footprint and cannot be easily deployed
at field sites to process associated gas
 stranded gas
 coal-bed methane
 vented gas
 or flared gas
 all markets the Company seeks
to service. The new plant is anticipated to prove out the economics for the Company&#8217;s technology and GTL processes.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES


applied in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows:




Major additions and improvements are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of equipment retired or sold
 are
removed from the accounts and any differences between the undepreciated amount and the proceeds from the sale or salvage value
are recorded as a gain or loss on sale of equipment. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the assets.




assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable
 in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification
 ASC Topic 360

 Plant and Equipment
impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset or asset group is expected to generate.
If an asset or asset group is considered impaired
 the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds its fair value. If estimated fair value is less than the book value
 the asset is written down to
the estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. There were no long-lived assets or impairment charges for the year
ended December 31
 2019.




recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016. Revenue recognition will depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures regarding the nature
 amount
 timing
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted the guidance on January 1
2018
 its effective date. The Company has not
 to date
 generated any revenues.




 2019
 the Company entered into
a Material Definitive Agreement related to the formation of OPM Green Energy
 LLC (OPMGE). The Company contributed a limited license
to use its proprietary and patented GTL technology for no actual cost basis in exchange for 42.86% (300 of 700 currently owned
member units) revenue interest in OPMGE
 expected to be later reduced to a 30% interest upon the completion of certain expected
third-party investments for the remining 300 of 1
000 member units available. The Company evaluated its interest in OPMGE and determined
that the Company does not control OPMGE. The Company accounts for its interest in OPMGE via the equity method of accounting. At
December 31
 2019
 there was no change in the investment cost of $0. At December 31
 2019
 OPMGE had no&#160;material activity
as of such date. As described in Note 9
 the Company maintains a Related Party receivable with OPMGE for $387
847 related to our
advancing capital for certain of its capital expenditures. The Company expects to fully recover the receivable once OPMGE operations
ramp up in 2020.



The preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Such estimates include allowance for collectible receivables
 derivative liability valuations and deferred
tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from such estimates.




purchased with an original maturity of three-months or less to be cash equivalents. Unless otherwise indicated
 all references
to &#8220;dollars&#8221; in this Form 10-K are to U.S. dollars. There were no cash equivalents at December 31
 2019 or December
31
 2018.




with FASB ASC 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes
&#8221; which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based
on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities
 using enacted
tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the
change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not
that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.


ASC 740-10-05 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The ASC clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an enterprise&#8217;s financial statements. The ASC prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The ASC provides guidance
on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods
 disclosure and transition. Open tax years
subject to IRS examination include 2014 &#8211; 2019.

Net Loss Per Share
 basic and diluted


 the basic
loss per share was computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
issued and outstanding. Shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants (10

 shares convertible for debt (2
083
333) and
shares outstanding but not yet issued (13

because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815


establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
 including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts
 and for hedging activities. They require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.


 a derivative
may be specifically designated as a hedge
 the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging
derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to
the hedged risk or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction. For a derivative not designated as a hedging
instrument
 the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change. The Company did not have any derivative liabilities
as of December 31

 2008
fair value measurements are determined by the Company&#8217;s adoption of authoritative guidance issued by the FASB
 with the exception
of the application of the statement to non-recurring
 non-financial assets and liabilities
 as permitted. Fair value is defined
in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. A fair value hierarchy was established
 which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows:


based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


based on
 observable inputs (other than level one prices)
 quoted market prices for similar assets such as at the measurement date;
quoted prices in the market that are not active; or other inputs that are observable
 either directly or indirectly.


based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity
 therefore requiring management&#8217;s best estimate
of what market participants would use as fair value.

 and
 is capable of producing 2
000 barrels of diesel

 Richard Halden and
Randy Moseley
 who both resigned from their respective management positions in 2016
 with Halden then further resigning as a director
from our Board of Directors in Feb 2017. Although we have not maintained currency with respect to the contractual payment obligations
therein
 both former employees are greater than five percent shareholders and had agreed to defer payments until such time as we
have sufficient available liquidity to begin making payments on a regular basis. In March of this year
 Halden filed suit against
the Company alleging claims arising from his severance and release agreement between the parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
interest
 court costs
 and attorney&#8217;s fees. The Company answered the lawsuit and asserted a number of affirmative defenses;
subsequently
 the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on November 19
 2019. Other than an increase in our legal expenses related
to defending against Halden&#8217;s lawsuit
 and given the subsequent dismissal of the same
 we expect no further material financial
impacts from such accrued fees until any such regular payments are able to begin
 or another form of settlement is reached.




 2017
 the Company entered into
a three-year consulting agreement with Chisos for public relations
 consulting and corporate communications services. The initial
payment was 1
800
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s restricted common stock. Additional payments were to be made upon the Company&#8217;s
common stock reaching certain price points over an extended period. Due to a breach of the Agreement by Chisos
 on June 22
 2018
the Board of Directors of the Company voted to terminate the Agreement. Based on the termination
 all warrants to purchase the
Company&#8217;s common stock were cancelled. Chisos sued the Company for breach of contract. The Company vigorously defended itself
and the litigation was dismissed without prejudice on November 19

 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). The updated guidance requires lessees to recognize
lease assets and lease liabilities for most operating leases. In addition
 the updated guidance requires that lessors separate
lease and non-lease components in a contract in accordance with the new revenue guidance in ASC 606. This guidance is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. The Company adopted this guidance effective January

 Dallas County
 Texas
against Mamaki of Hawaii
 Inc. (&#8220;Mamaki&#8221;)
 Hawaiian Beverages
 Inc.(&#8220;HBI&#8221;)
 Curtis Borman and Lee Jenison
for breach of a Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 29
 2015
 wherein the Company sold its shares in Mamaki to HBI for $700
000
(along with the assumption of certain debt). The Company maintained its guaranty on the original loan as a component of the sale
transaction. The Defendants failed to make payments of $150
000 each on November 30
 2015
 December 28
 2015 and January 27
 2016.
On January 13
 2017
 the parties executed a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (Agreement). However
 the Defendants again
defaulted in their payment obligations under this new Agreement. Curtis Borman and Lee Jennison were co-guarantors of the obligations
of Mamaki and HBI. To secure their guaranties
 each of Curtis Borman and Lee Jennsion posted 1
241
500 and 1
000
000 shares
 respectively
of the Company. Under the Agreement
 the shares were valued at $.20. Due to the default under the Agreement
 these shares were
returned to the Company&#8217;s treasury shares. Curtis Borman subsequently filed for bankruptcy and the property was liquidated
for $600
000
 applied against the prior loan amount
 leaving a remaining guaranteed loan payment balance of approximately $700
000
including accrued interest and legal fees. On September 26
 2019
 we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Southwest
 providing
1

 Wildcat
 a company controlled
by a shareholder Gleason
 filed suit against the Company
 alleging claims arising from a prior consulting agreement between the
parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&#8217;s fees. On September 27
 2018
 Wildcat
filed a second suit against the Company alleging claims arising from a Promissory Note between the parties
 seeking to recover
monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&#8217;s fees. On February 13
 2019
 the parties attended mediation which
resulted in settlement discussions which resulted in a Rule 11 Agreement settling both disputes. Pursuant to the Rule 11 Agreement
the parties agreed to abate both cases until the earlier of a default of the performance of the Rule 11 Agreement or October 30
2019. The Rule 11 Agreement was drafted to allow the Parties time to draft and sign the Wildcat Settlement Agreement
 to make payments
due on or before October 15
 2019
 and to allow for the transfer of stock to effectuate the terms of the Rule 11 Agreement. The
material terms of the Rule 11 Agreement were as follows:



    
    
The Company agreed to execute a new Promissory Note to replace the original Promissory Note
 effective November 13
 2017
 the effective date of the original note. The new Promissory Note has a maturity date of March 1
 2020 and provides for four equal payments of principal through such date
 and accrued interest at 10% upon maturity. The Company made the three payments due through December 2019
 and made the final payment in March 2020
 thereby extinguishing such Promissory Note.

    
    
    

    
    
The Company agreed to pay $300
000 in settlement of the prior Consulting Agreement in 60 installments of $5
000 each month
 until paid in full. The $300
000 payable was accrued as of December 31
 2018
 of which $40
000 has been paid through the period ending December 31
 2019.

    
    
    

    
    
The Parties agreed to amend the existing Overriding Royalty Agreement (&#8220;ORRI&#8221;) between the Company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary
 Greenway Innovative Energy
 Inc. (&#8220;GIE&#8221;)
 increasing Wildcat&#8217;s royalties from .25% (1/4 of 1%) to .375% (3/8 of 1%).

    
    
    

    
    
The Company agreed to pay Wildcat&#8217;s legal fees related to these matters
 capped at $60
000
 in three installments of $20
000 on June 1
 August 1
 and October 1
 2019
 all such payments having been made in the period ending December 31
 2019.

    
    
    

    
    
The Company agreed to issue 1
500
000 restricted shares of its Common Stock on or before October 15
 2019
 in consideration of the Promissory Note
 in exchange for extinguishment of all prior granted warrants and to complete the grant of 1
000
000 shares not received from a prior transaction. The Company issued such 1
500
000 restricted shares and the expense for such issuance was accrued on the Company&#8217;s Balance Sheet on the effective date of the Rule 11 Agreement and increased by $45
000 based upon the actual value of the shares on the date of issuance for the period ending December 31
 2019.



if the Company timely performed through October 15
 2019
 the Parties would file a Joint Motion for Dismissal and present Agreed
Orders of Dismissal with prejudice for both lawsuits.


the Rule 11 Agreement
 however Gleason refused to sign the Wildcat Settlement Agreement at the point of the Company&#8217;s having
performed its obligations. The parties&#8217; respective counsels then mutually agreed to extend the original October 15
 2019
settlement date until at least the end of the year while the parties waited for Gleason&#8217;s signature. Gleason signed the Compromise
Settlement and Release Agreement on February 4
 2020
 and all litigation was dismissed by the Court on February 25
 2020.


 2019
 Chisos
 a company controlled
by dissident shareholder Halden
 filed suit against the Company
 alleging claims arising from a consulting agreement between the
parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&#8217;s fees. The Company answered the lawsuit
and asserted a number of affirmative defenses; subsequently
 the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on November 19

 dissident shareholder Halden
in his capacity as an individual
 filed suit against the Company alleging claims arising from a confidential severance and release
agreement between the parties
 seeking to recover monetary damages
 interest
 court costs
 and attorney&#8217;s fees. The Company
answered the lawsuit and asserted a number of affirmative defenses; subsequently
 the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on
November 19
 2019.


 2019
 the Company filed a verified
petition for Declaratory Judgement
 Ex Parte Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and Application for Injunctive Relief
against the members of a dissident shareholders group (including Halden) named the &#8220;Greenway Shareholders Committee&#8221;
in Dallas County. A Temporary Restraining Order was issued by the court enjoining the Defendants (and their officers
 agents
 servants
employees and attorneys) and those persons in active concert or participation from; holding the special shareholders meeting on
April 4
 2019 or calling such meeting to order; attending or participating in the Special Meeting; voting the shares of Plaintiff
owned by any Defendant at the Special Meeting
 either directly or by granting a proxy to allow a non-defendant to vote said shares;
voting any shares of Plaintiff owned by non-defendants with or by proxy at the Special Meeting; and serving as chairman at the
Special Meeting. On April 8
 2019
 the court issued such Temporary Injunction against the dissident shareholders who received notice.
The Injunction continued until the trial date of December 10
 2019; no trial was held and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice
on November 26
 2019.


 2019 the Company was served
with a lawsuit by Norman Reynolds
 a previously engaged counsel by the Company. The suit was filed in Harris County District Court
Houston
 Texas
 asserting claims for unpaid fees of $90
378. While fully reserved
 Greenway vigorously disputes the total amount
claimed. Greenway has asserted counterclaims based upon alleged conflicts of interest
 breaches of fiduciary duty and violations
of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (&#8220;DTPA&#8221;). Greenway is confident in its defenses and counterclaims and intends
to vigorously defend its interests and prosecute its claims.

to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31
 2019
 we have an accumulated deficit of $30
479

For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we incurred a net loss of $3
661
245 and used $1
332
528 in net cash for operating activities.
In addition
 we had a working capital deficiency of $6
364
485 as of December 31
 2019. The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations or on the ability of the Company to
obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. While the Company is attempting to commence revenue generating operations
and thereby generate sustainable revenues
 the Company&#8217;s current cash position is not sufficient to support its ongoing daily
operations and requires the Company to raise addition capital through debt and/or equity sources. Management believes that its
current and future plans will enable it to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date of this report.

a Material Definitive Agreement related to the formation of OPM Green Energy
 LLC (OPMGE). The Company contributed a limited license
to use its proprietary and patented GTL technology for no actual cost basis in exchange for 42.86% (300 of 700 currently owned
member units) revenue interest in OPMGE
 expected to be later reduced to a 30% interest upon the completion of certain expected
third-party investments for the remining 300 of 1
000 member units available. The Company evaluated its interest in OPMGE and
determined that the Company does not control OPMGE. The Company accounts for its interest in OPMGE via the equity method of accounting.
At December 31
 2019
 there was no change in the investment cost of $0. At December 31
 2019
 OPMGE had no&#160;material activity
as of such date. As described in Note 9
 the Company maintains a Related Party receivable with OPMGE for $387
847 related to our
advancing capital for certain of its capital expenditures. The Company expects to fully recover the receivable once OPMGE operations
ramp up in 2020.







The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include allowance for collectible receivables
 derivative liability valuations
and deferred tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from such estimates.

&#8221; which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based
on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities
 using enacted
tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the
change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not
that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.

in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815


establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
 including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts
 and for hedging activities. They require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.


 a derivative
may be specifically designated as a hedge
 the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging
derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to
the hedged risk or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction. For a derivative not designated as a hedging
instrument
 the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change. The Company did not have any derivative liabilities
as of December 31

for discussion regarding convertible notes payable and warrants.








 2008
fair value measurements are determined by the Company&#8217;s adoption of authoritative guidance issued by the FASB
 with the exception
of the application of the statement to non-recurring
 non-financial assets and liabilities
 as permitted. Fair value is defined
in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. A fair value hierarchy was established
 which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows:


based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


based on
 observable inputs (other than level one prices)
 quoted market prices for similar assets such as at the measurement date;
quoted prices in the market that are not active; or other inputs that are observable
 either directly or indirectly.


based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity
 therefore requiring management&#8217;s best estimate
of what market participants would use as fair value.

 2019
 the Company had unused
net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $30.1 million available to reduce future federal taxable income. Net operating
loss carryforwards of $23.6 million expire through fiscal years ending 2037
 and 6.5 million may be carried forward indefinitely.
Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carryforwards after
a change in control (generally a greater than 50% change in ownership).


ability to offset future taxable income
 if any
 with tax net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to the non-filing
of tax returns and the impact of the statute of limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to claim such benefits. Furthermore
changes in ownership may result in limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Due to these limitations
 and other considerations
management has established full valuation allowances on deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforward
 as the
realization of any future benefits from these assets is uncertain. The change in the valuation allowance was $5
469
078 and $233
