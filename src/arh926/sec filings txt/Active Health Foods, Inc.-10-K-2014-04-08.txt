IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN
 INVESTORS MAY FACE A COMPLETE LOSS OF THEIR INVESTMENT


 we have commenced operations and generated limited revenues.&#160;&#160;Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If our business fails
 our investors in may face a complete loss of their investment.

BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY RECENTLY COMMENCED BUSINESS OEPRATIONS
 WE FACE A HIGH RISK OF BUSINESS FAILURE


 expenses and uncertainties that a developing company like ours faces. Potential investors should be aware that there is a substantial risk of failure associated with any new business venture as a result of problems encountered in connection with the commencement of new operations. These problems include
 but are not limited to
 an unstable economy
 unanticipated problems relating to the entry of new competition
 unanticipated moves by existing competition and unexpected additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. Also
 to date
 we have completed only partial development of our intended operations and we can provide no assurance that our company will have a successful commercial application. There is no operating history upon which to base any projections as to the likelihood that we will prove successful in our current business plan
 and thus there can be no assurance that we will be a viable
 ongoing concern.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTAIN PROFITABILITY WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING
 WHICH MAY BE UNAVAILABLE


 we have funded our operations with limited initial capital and minimal sales and have not generated sufficient funds from operations to be profitable or to maintain consistent operations. Unless we begin to generate sufficient revenues
 on a consistent basis
 to sustain an ongoing business operation
 we may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force us to cease operations if additional financing
 under acceptable terms and conditions
 is not available. In the event our cash resources are insufficient to continue operations
 we intend to consider raising additional capital through offerings and sales of equity or debt securities. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient funds
 we will be forced to terminate business operations. The possibility of such an outcome presents the risk of a complete loss of your investment in our common stock.






 investors in this offering will have limited control over matters requiring approval by our security holders
 including the election of directors
 the approval of significant corporate transactions and any change of control and management of the Company. This concentrated control may also make it difficult for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of their common stock in the event the Company enters into transactions which require stockholder approval. &#160;






THE COSTS
 EXPENSES AND COMPLEXITY OF SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE MAY INHIBIT OR SEVERELY RESTRICT&#160;OUR OPERATIONS


 the costs of maintaining our status as a reporting entity may inhibit our ability to continue our operations.




 we reasonably believe that the Company will begin to generate significant revenues sufficient to maintain our operations. However
 failure to generate sufficient and consistent revenues to fully execute and adequately maintain our business plan may result in failure of our business and the loss of your investment.




 our actual and potential competitors are larger companies with longer operating histories
 greater financial and marketing resources
 with superior name recognition and an entrenched client base. Therefore
 many of these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to attracting customers and be able to grant preferred pricing. Competition by existing and future competitors could result in our inability to secure an adequate consumer base sufficient enough to support our endeavors. We cannot be assured that we will be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors or that the competitive pressure we may face will not force us to cease operations.

 the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their estimated fair values. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets. The evaluation of long-lived assets requires the Company to use estimates of future cash flows. However
 actual cash flows may differ from the estimated future cash flows used in these impairment tests. During the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company recorded no impairment of its assets.

 which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. &#160;The asset and liability method requires that the current or deferred tax consequences of all events recognized in the financial statements are measured by applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to determine the amount of taxes payable or refundable currently or in future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recovered.

 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date
 with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments
 including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity
 is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
 or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).








Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities and listed equities.








Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
 and Director Independence




 in which the registrant was or is to be a participant and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.




 Gregory Manos and officer and director

 we refer to NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 4200(a)(15). Based on those widely-accepted criteria
 we have determined that our Directors are not independent at this time.


. Accordingly
 certain conflicts of interest may arise between us and our officer(s) and director(s) in that they may have other business interests in the future to which they devote their attention
 and they may be expected to continue to do so although management time must also be devoted to our business. As a result
 conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through their exercise of such judgment as is consistent with each officer's understanding of his/her fiduciary duties to us.


 as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the SEC
 the New York and American Stock Exchanges and the Nasdaq Stock Market
 as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley
 require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than legally required
 we have not yet adopted these measures. Because none of our directors are independent directors
 we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees. As a result
 these directors have the ability
 among other things
 to determine their own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures
 regardless of whether such compliance is required
 the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions
 conflicts of interest
 if any
 and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations.


 we may find it very difficult or be unable to attract and retain qualified officers
 directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in a series of rules and regulations by the SEC that increase responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officers.

 Inc. (&amp;#147;the Company&amp;#148;) was incorporated on January 9
 2008
 as a California corporation to develop and market health foods and nutritional supplements. &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre style=&apos;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;The Company&apos;s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital
 it could be forced to cease operations.&amp;#160; &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reclassification&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&lt;font lang=&quot;X-NONE&quot;&gt;Certain balances in previously issued financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period presentation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Use of Estimates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.&amp;#160; Actual results could differ from those estimates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cash and Cash Equivalents&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre style=&apos;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;For purposes of financial statement presentation

The Company uses an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over the remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable. If the carrying values of the assets exceed the expected future cash flows of the assets
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their estimated fair values. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets. The evaluation of long-lived assets requires the Company to use estimates of future cash flows. However
 actual cash flows may differ from the estimated future cash flows used in these impairment tests. During the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company recorded no impairment of its assets.&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;u&gt;Revenue Recognition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The Company&amp;#146;s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104. Sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists
 the price is fixed or determinable
 the delivery is completed
 no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue net of an allowance for estimated returns
 at the time the merchandise is sold or services performed. The allowance for sales returns is estimated based on the Company&amp;#146;s historical experience. Sales taxes are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues and costs). Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.&lt;b&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:115%;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advertising&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;margin-left:.5in;line-height:115%;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. The Company incurred advertising costs of $12
522 and $28
399 during the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre style=&apos;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Provision for Taxes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The Company applies ASC 740
 which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. &amp;nbsp;The asset and liability method requires that the current or deferred tax consequences of all events recognized in the financial statements are measured by applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to determine the amount of taxes payable or refundable currently or in future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recovered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The Company adopted ASC 740
 at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. This interpretation requires recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions using a &amp;#147;more-likely-than-not&amp;#148; approach
 requiring the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. The adoption of ASC 740 had no material impact on the Company&amp;#146;s financial statements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stock-Based Compensation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718 which requires all share-based payments to employees
 including grants of employee stock options
 to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model for determining the fair value of stock-based compensation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Equity instruments issued to non-employees for goods or services are accounted at fair value when the service is complete or a performance commitment date is reached
 whichever is earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Basic Loss Per Share&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The computations of basic loss per share of common stock are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial statements. The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding as of December 31
 2013 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font lang=&quot;DE&quot;&gt;Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our consolidated financial statements. The Company&amp;#146;s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#146;s financial statements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font style=&apos;background:white&apos;&gt;Fair value measurements and derivative liability&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font style=&apos;background:white&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;The Company evaluates all of it financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities
 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date
 with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments
 including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity
 is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;Under ASC-815 the conversion options embedded in the notes payable described in Note 6 require liability classification because they do not contain an explicit limit to the number of shares that could be issued upon settlement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;During 2013
 certain notes payable were converted resulting in settlement of the related derivative &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;liabilities. &amp;nbsp;The Company re-measured the embedded conversion options at fair value on the date of settlement and recorded these amounts to additional paid-in capital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;During 2013
 the Company issued additional convertible notes. &amp;nbsp;The conversion options and warrants were classified as derivative liabilities at their fair value on the date of issuance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;As defined in FASB ASC 820
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
 or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&apos;line-height:115%;width:100.0%&apos;&gt; &lt;tr align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;td width=&quot;96&quot; style=&apos;width:1.0in;padding:0&apos;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&apos;padding:0&apos;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;td width=&quot;96&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&apos;width:1.0in;padding:0&apos;&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Level 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#150;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&apos;padding:0&apos;&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities and listed equities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&apos;line-height:115%;width:100.0%&apos;&gt; &lt;tr align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;td width=&quot;96&quot; style=&apos;width:1.0in;padding:0&apos;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&apos;padding:0&apos;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;td width=&quot;96&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&apos;width:1.0in;padding:0&apos;&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Level 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&apos;padding:0&apos;&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1

 the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their estimated fair values. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets. The evaluation of long-lived assets requires the Company to use estimates of future cash flows. However
 actual cash flows may differ from the estimated future cash flows used in these impairment tests. During the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012


 the price is fixed or determinable
 the delivery is completed
 no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue net of an allowance for estimated returns

 2013 and 2012


 which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. &amp;nbsp;The asset and liability method requires that the current or deferred tax consequences of all events recognized in the financial statements are measured by applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to determine the amount of taxes payable or refundable currently or in future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recovered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The Company adopted ASC 740
 at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. This interpretation requires recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions using a &amp;#147;more-likely-than-not&amp;#148; approach


 including grants of employee stock options
 to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model for determining the fair value of stock-based compensation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;text-align:justify;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Equity instruments issued to non-employees for goods or services are accounted at fair value when the service is complete or a performance commitment date is reached


 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding as of December 31

	

 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date
 with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments
 including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity
 is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;Under ASC-815 the conversion options embedded in the notes payable described in Note 6 require liability classification because they do not contain an explicit limit to the number of shares that could be issued upon settlement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;During 2013
 certain notes payable were converted resulting in settlement of the related derivative &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;liabilities. &amp;nbsp;The Company re-measured the embedded conversion options at fair value on the date of settlement and recorded these amounts to additional paid-in capital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;During 2013
 the Company issued additional convertible notes. &amp;nbsp;The conversion options and warrants were classified as derivative liabilities at their fair value on the date of issuance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt&apos;&gt;As defined in FASB ASC 820
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated

FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&apos;line-height:115%;width:100.0%&apos;&gt; &lt;tr align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;td width=&quot;96&quot; style=&apos;width:1.0in;padding:0&apos;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&apos;padding:0&apos;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;td width=&quot;96&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&apos;width:1.0in;padding:0&apos;&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Level 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#150;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&apos;padding:0&apos;&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

 marketable securities and listed equities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&apos;line-height:115%;width:100.0%&apos;&gt; &lt;tr align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;td width=&quot;96&quot; style=&apos;width:1.0in;padding:0&apos;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&apos;padding:0&apos;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;td width=&quot;96&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&apos;width:1.0in;padding:0&apos;&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Level 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&apos;padding:0&apos;&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;line-height:normal&apos;&gt;Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1

The Company evaluates all of it financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities
 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date
 with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments
 including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity
During 2013
During 2013
As defined in FASB ASC 820
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1

The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.

Long-lived tangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company uses an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over the remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable. If the carrying values of the assets exceed the expected future cash flows of the assets
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their estimated fair values. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets. The evaluation of long-lived assets requires the Company to use estimates of future cash flows. However
 actual cash flows may differ from the estimated future cash flows used in these impairment tests. During the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
The Company&#146;s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104. Sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists

 the delivery is completed
 no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue net of an allowance for estimated returns
The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. The Company incurred advertising costs of $12
522 and $28
399 during the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
The Company applies ASC 740
The Company adopted ASC 740
 at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. This interpretation requires recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions using a &#147;more-likely-than-not&#148; approach
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718 which requires all share-based payments to employees
 including grants of employee stock options
Equity instruments issued to non-employees for goods or services are accounted at fair value when the service is complete or a performance commitment date is reached
The computations of basic loss per share of common stock are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial statements. The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding as of December 31
The Company evaluates all of it financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities
 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date
 with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments
 including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity
During 2013
During 2013
As defined in FASB ASC 820
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1

Long-lived tangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company uses an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over the remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable. If the carrying values of the assets exceed the expected future cash flows of the assets
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their estimated fair values. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets. The evaluation of long-lived assets requires the Company to use estimates of future cash flows. However
 actual cash flows may differ from the estimated future cash flows used in these impairment tests. During the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company recorded no impairment of its assets.

The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital
In order to continue as a going concern
 the Company will need
 among other things
 additional capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.

No provision has been made in the financial statements for income taxes because the Company has accumulated losses from operations since inception. &nbsp;Any deferred tax benefit arising from the operating loss carried forward is offset entirely by a valuation allowance since it is currently not likely that the Company will be significantly profitable in the near future to take advantage of the losses. &nbsp;The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the combined U.S. federal and state income tax rates of 42.8% to pretax income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31

The Company&#146;s net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $2

 if any
The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740 at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. As a result of this adoption
 the Company has not made any adjustments to deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions on returns that have been filed or that will be filed. The Company has not had operations resulting in net income and is carrying a large Net Operating Loss as disclosed above. &nbsp;Since it is not thought that this Net Operating Loss will ever produce a tax benefit
 even if examined by taxing authorities and disallowed entirely
 there would be no effect on the financial statements.

The Company&#146;s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104. Sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists
 the price is fixed or determinable
 the delivery is completed
 no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue net of an allowance for estimated returns
 at the time the merchandise is sold or services performed. The allowance for sales returns is estimated based on the Company&#146;s historical experience. Sales taxes are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues and costs). Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.




        
          

        
          
            

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    








        
          

        
          
            

 the policy for each material type of transaction is generally disclosed. If a sales transaction has multiple element arrangements (for example
 delivery of multiple products
 services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.
              
                
              

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    





















    
  
      

          

        

      






        
        


        
Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis.&#160; Specific reserves are estimated by management based on certain assumptions and variables

Active Health Foods
 Inc. (&#147;the Company&#148;) was incorporated on January 9
 2008
The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital
 it could be forced to cease operations.&#160;
