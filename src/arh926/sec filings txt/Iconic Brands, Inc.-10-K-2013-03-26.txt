Iconic Brands
 Inc.
 formerly Paw Spa
 Inc. (&#8220;Iconic Brands&#8221;)
 was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 21
 2005.&#160;&#160;Our plan was to provide mobile grooming and spa services for cats and dogs.&#160;Our services were going to include bathing
 hair cutting and styling
 brushing/combing
 flea and tick treatments
 nail maintenance and beautification
 ear cleaning
 teeth cleaning
 hot oil treatments
 and massage.&#160;We did not have any business operations and failed to generate any revenues.&#160;We abandoned this business
 as we lacked sufficient capital resources.&#160;&#160;On June 10
 2009
 the Company acquired Harbrew Imports
 Ltd. (&#8220;Harbrew New York&#8221;)
 a New York
corporation incorporated on September 8
 1999 which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbrew Imports
 Ltd. Corp. (&#8220;Harbrew Florida&#8221;)
 a Florida corporation incorporated on January 4
 2007.&#160;&#160;On the Closing Date
 pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement
 the Company issued to the designees of Harbrew New York 27
352
301 shares of our Common Stock at the Closing
 or approximately 64% of the 42
510
301 shares outstanding subsequent to the merger.&#160;After the merger
 Harbrew New York continued as the surviving company under the laws of the state of New York and became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.


In anticipation of the merger between Iconic Brands
 Inc. and Harbrew New York
 on May 1
 2009 the Board of Directors and a majority of shareholders of Harbrew New York approved the amendment of its Articles of Incorporation changing its name to Iconic Imports
 Inc. (&#8220;Iconic Imports&#8221;).&#160;On June 22
 2009
 this action was filed with the New York State Department of State.


Prior to the merger on June 10
 2009
 Iconic Brands had no assets
 liabilities
 or business operations.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the merger has been treated for accounting purposes as a recapitalization by the accounting acquirer Harbrew New York/Iconic Imports and the financial statements reflect the assets
 liabilities
 and operations of Harbrew New York/Iconic Imports from its inception on September 8
 1999 to June 10
 2009 and are combined with Iconic Brands thereafter.&#160;&#160;Iconic Brands and its wholly-owned subsidiary Harbrew New York/Iconic Imports are hereafter referred to as the &#8220;Company&#8221;.


The Company was a brand owner of self-developed alcoholic beverages.&#160;&#160;Furthermore
 the Company imported
 marketed and sold these beverages throughout the United States and globally.


Effective June 10
 2009
 prior to the merger
 Harbrew Florida affected a 1-for-1
000 reverse stock split of its common stock
 reducing the issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 24
592
160 to 24
909
 which includes a total of 317 shares resulting from the rounding of fractional shares.


On August 20
 2010
 the Company and Seven Cellos LLC terminated the License Agreement relating to the distribution of an alcoholic beverage known as &#8220;Danny DeVito&#8217;s Premium Limoncello&#8221;.&#160;&#160;In the year ended December 31
 2010
 this brand accounted for approximately 96% of total sales.


On August 20
 2010
 Capstone Capital Group I
 LLC

000
 delivered a Formal Notice of Default to the Company demanding payment of the balance on or before September 1
 2010. On September 16
 2010

 accounts receivable

 equipment
 and contract rights) and its intent to sell the Collateral to the highest qualified bidder in a public sale on September 28
 2010.&#160;&#160;On September 28
 2010
 Capstone acquired the Collateral in exchange for the Promissory Note at the
public auction sale; there were no other bidders.


On September 14
 2010
 the Second District Court of Suffolk County New York issued a Warrant of Eviction removing the Company from its Lindenhurst
 New York office and the Company ceased its business operations.


On September 23

 Inc. (&#8220;Imports&#8221;)
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Iconic Brands
 Inc.
 filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York.&#160;The Bankruptcy case is being administered under case No. 8-11-76814.&#160;&#160;&#160;The petition indicated that Imports had no assets and had liabilities of approximately $3
354
000.&#160;&#160;The case is still pending before the court.


















On September 12
 2012
 the Company announced the signing of a non-binding letter of intent (the &#8220;LOI&#8221;)&#160;&#160;to acquire 45% of the membership units of United Spirits
 LLC (&#8220;Spirits&#8221;) owned by the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer
 Richard DeCicco. As material terms have yet to be negotiated or agreed to
 there is no assurance that the acquisition of membership units will close and
 if it closes
 that the terms will be favorable to the Company.






As of December 31
 2011
 the Company had no employees other than its sole officer.










As noted above

 2010
 the Second District Court of Suffolk County New York issued a Warrant of Eviction removing the Company from its Lindenhurst
 New York office and the Company ceased its business operations. 




The Company is party to a variety of legal proceedings.&#160;We accrue for these items as losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated.&#160;While the results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty
 management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will have
 and have had a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations and financial position.

The following discussion is an overview of the important factors that management focuses on in evaluating our business
 financial condition and operating performance and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of any number of factors.



Prior to the consummation of the Merger Agreement
 Harbrew New York was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harbrew Florida. Harbrew Florida was incorporated in the state of Florida on January 4
 2007
 under the former name Stassi Harbrew Imports Corp.
 pursuant to the Bankruptcy Court Approved Reorganization Plan for the Stassi Interaxx
 Inc. (&#8220;Stassi&#8221;) reorganization confirmed on December 20
 2006. On May 17
 2007
 Harbrew Florida acquired Harbrew New York
 a New York corporation incorporated on September 8
 1999 engaged in importing and wholesaling spirits
 wine and beer. As a result
 Harbrew New York became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harbrew Florida.

On June 10
 2009
 Merger Sub
 Harbrew Florida
 Harbrew New York and we entered into a Merger Agreement which resulted in Harbrew New York becoming our wholly owned subsidiary (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). The Merger was accomplished by means of a Merger Agreement in which Harbrew New York merged with and into Merger Sub and each share of Harbrew&#8217;s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into one share of Iconic Brands&#8217; common stock. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement and as a result of the Merger:






















In exchange for all of the shares of Harbrew common stock
 each share of Harbrew&#8217;s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into one share of Iconic Brands&#8217; common stock.





This transaction closed on June 10
 2009.
















Prior to the merger on June 10
 2009
 we had no assets
 liabilities
 or business operations. Accordingly
 the merger has been treated for accounting purposes as a recapitalization by the accounting acquirer
 Harbrew New York
 and the financial statements reflect the assets
 liabilities
 and operations of Harbrew New York from its inception on September 8
 1999 to June 10
 2009 and us thereafter. References to our company are with respect to Harbrew New York to June 10
 2009 and us thereafter.

On September 16
 2010
 Capstone Capital Group LLC notified the Company that in accordance with the Formal Notice of Default dated August 20
 2010
 Capstone is exercising its right to attach and sell all the collateral referred to in the promissory note between the parties. The collateral consists of: all inventory
 all equipment
 machinery
 fixtures
 vehicles
 furnishings
 general intangibles
 including trademarks
 trade names
 and anything else owned by Harbrew Imports Ltd
 the predecessor name of Iconic Imports
 Inc.

On September 28
 2010
 an auction was held at the company&#8217;s warehouse located at 1174 Route 109 Lindenhurst NY. A bid was made by Capstone Capital Group I
 LLC and Capstone Business Credit
 LLC in the amount of $233
075.35 representing the credit balance due on the Promissory Note (as more fully described in that certain Termination Agreement
 dated June 5
 2010) by and among Harbrew Imports
 Ltd ( Iconic Imports
 Inc.
) Capstone Capital Group I
LLC and Capstone Business Credit
 LLC). There were no other bids and the Auction was closed at 10.03 AM.

On September 14
 2010
 the Second District Court of Suffolk County New York issued a Warrant of Eviction removing the Company from its Lindenhurst
 New York office and the Company ceased its business operations.

On September 23
 2011
 Iconic Imports
 Inc. (&#8220;Imports&#8221;)
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Iconic Brands
 Inc.
 filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. The Bankruptcy case is being administered under case No. 8-11-76814. The petition indicated that Imports had no assets and had liabilities of approximately $3
354
000. The case is still pending before the court

The Company plans to improve its financial condition by reorganizing. However
 there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing these objectives.

We hope to be in the business of importing and wholesaling spirits
 wine and beer to distributors in the United States on a national basis and to retail licensees both on and off premise in New York
 through our wholesale license. 



Certain statements contained in this prospectus
 including statements regarding the anticipated development and expansion of our business
 our intent
 belief or current expectations
 primarily with respect to the future operating performance of Iconic Brands
 Inc. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they are made.



Although we intend to be in the spirits business
 during the next 12 months
 the Company intends to seek
 investigate and
 if such investigation warrants
 acquire an interest in one or more business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of a publicly held corporation. At this time
 the Company has no plan
 proposal
 agreement
 understanding or arrangement to acquire or merge with any specific business or company
 and the Company has not identified any specific business or company for investigation and evaluation. No member of Management or promoter of the Company has had any material discussions with any other company with respect to any
acquisition of that company.

















Although we hope to be in the spirits business
 the Company will not restrict its search to any specific business
 industry or geographical location
 and the Company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. The discussion of the proposed plan of operation under this caption and throughout this Annual Report is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of the Company's virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities.

The Company will have to obtain funds in one or more private placements to finance the operation of any acquired business. Persons purchasing securities in these placements and other shareholders will likely not have the opportunity to participate in the decision relating to any acquisition. The Company's proposed business is sometimes referred to as a blind pool because any investors will entrust their investment monies to the Company's management before they have a chance to analyze any ultimate use to which their money may be put. Consequently
 the Company's potential success is heavily dependent on the Company's management
 which will have virtually unlimited discretion in searching for and entering
into a business opportunity. None of the officers and directors of the Company has had any experience in the proposed business of the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise any funds in private placements. In any private placement
 management may purchase shares on the same terms as offered in the private placement.

Management anticipates that it will only participate in one potential business venture. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in the Company because it will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another. The Company may seek a business opportunity with a firm which only recently commenced operations
 or a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets
 or seeking to develop a new product or service
 or an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in the need for additional capital which is perceived to be easier to raise by a
public company. In some instances
 a business opportunity may involve the acquisition or merger with a corporation which does not need substantial additional cash but which desires to establish a public trading market for its common stock. The Company may purchase assets and establish wholly owned subsidiaries in various business or purchase existing businesses as subsidiaries.

The Company anticipates that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions
 rapid technological advances being made in some industries
 and shortages of available capital
 management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the benefits of a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of a publicly traded corporation may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought
 providing liquidity for the principals of a business
 creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees
 providing liquidity (subject to
restrictions of applicable statutes) for all shareholders
 and other factors. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development
 all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.

As part of any transaction
 the acquired company may require that management or other stockholders of the Company sell all or a portion of their shares to the acquired company
 or to the principals of the acquired company. It is anticipated that the sales price of such shares will be lower than the current market price or anticipated market price of the Company's Common Stock. The Company's funds are not expected to be used for purposes of any stock purchase from insiders. The Company shareholders will not be provided the opportunity to approve or consent to such sale. The opportunity to sell all or a portion of their shares in connection with an acquisition may influence management's decision to enter into a
specific transaction. However
 management believes that since the anticipated sales price will be less than market value
 that the potential of a stock sale by management will be a material factor on their decision to enter a specific transaction.

















The above description of potential sales of management stock is not based upon any corporate bylaw
 shareholder or board resolution
 or contract or agreement. No other payments of cash or property are expected to be received by Management in connection with any acquisition.

The Company has not formulated any policy regarding the use of consultants or outside advisors
 but does not anticipate that it will use the services of such persons.

The Company has
 and will continue to have
 insufficient capital with which to provide the owners of business opportunities with any significant cash or other assets. However
 management believes the Company will offer owners of business opportunities the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership interest in a public company at substantially less cost than is required to conduct an initial public offering. The owners of the business opportunities will
 however
 incur significant post-merger or acquisition registration costs in the event they wish to register a portion of their shares for subsequent sale. The Company will also incur significant legal and accounting costs in connection with the acquisition
of a business opportunity including the costs of preparing post-effective amendments
 Forms 8-K
 agreements and related reports and documents nevertheless
 the officers and directors of the Company have not conducted market research and are not aware of statistical data which would support the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity.





The Company anticipates that business opportunities for possible acquisition will be referred by various sources
 including its officers and directors
 professional advisers
 securities broker-dealers
 venture capitalists
 members of the financial community
 and others who may present unsolicited proposals.

The Company will seek a potential business opportunity from all known sources
 but will rely principally on personal contacts of its officers and directors as well as indirect associations between them and other business and professional people. It is not presently anticipated that the Company will engage professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations.

The officers and directors of the Company are currently employed in other positions and will devote only a portion of their time (not more than three hour per week) to the business affairs of the Company
 until such time as an acquisition has been determined to be highly favorable
 at which time they expect to spend full time in investigating and closing any acquisition for a period of two weeks. In addition
 in the face of competing demands for their time
 the officers and directors may grant priority to their full-time positions rather than to the Company.



The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the Company. Management intends to concentrate on identifying prospective business opportunities which may be brought to its attention through present associations with management. In analyzing prospective business opportunities
 management will consider such matters as the available technical
 financial and managerial resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operation
 if any; prospects for the future; present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management; the potential
for further research
 development or exploration; specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the Company; the potential for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products
 services or trades; name identification; and other relevant factors. Officers and directors of the Company will meet personally with management and key personnel of the firm sponsoring the business opportunity as part of their investigation. To the extent possible
 the Company intends to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors. The Company will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained.
















It may be anticipated that any opportunity in which the Company participates will present certain risks. Many of these risks cannot be adequately identified prior to selection of the specific opportunity
 and the Company's shareholders must
 therefore
 depend on the ability of management to identify and evaluate such risk. In the case of some of the opportunities available to the Company
 it may be anticipated that the promoters thereof have been unable to develop a going concern or that such business is in its development stage in that it has not generated significant revenues from its principal business activities prior to the Company's anticipation. There is a risk
 even after the Company's participation
in the activity and the related expenditure of the Company's funds
 that the combined enterprises will still be unable to become a going concern or advance beyond the development stage. Many of the opportunities may involve new and untested products
 processes
 or market strategies which may not succeed. Such risks will be assumed by the Company and
 therefore
 its shareholders.

The Company will not restrict its search for any specific kind of business
 but may acquire a venture which is in its preliminary or development stage
 which is already in operation
 or in essentially any stage of its corporate life. It is currently impossible to predict the status of any business in which the Company may become engaged
 in that such business may need additional capital
 may merely desire to have its shares publicly traded
 or may seek other perceived advantages which the Company may offer.



In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition
 the Company may become a party to a merger
 consolidation
 reorganization
 joint venture
 franchise or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. It may also purchase stock or assets of an existing business. On the consummation of a transaction
 it is possible that the present management and shareholders of the Company will not be in control of the Company. In addition
 a majority or all of the Company's officers and directors may
 as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction
 resign and be replaced by new officers and directors without a vote of the Company's shareholders.

It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance on exemptions from registration under applicable Federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances
 however
 as a negotiated element of this transaction
 the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated
 under certain conditions
 or at specified time thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in the Company's Common Stock may have a depressive effect on such market. While the actual terms of a transaction to which the Company may be a party cannot be predicted
 it may
be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition in a so called tax free reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended (the Code). In order to obtain tax free treatment under the Code
 it may be necessary for the owners of the acquired business to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event
 the shareholders of the Company
 including investors in this offering
 would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity
 which could result in significant dilution in the equity of such shareholders.

As part of the Company's investigation
 officers and directors of the Company will meet personally with management and key personnel
 may visit and inspect material facilities
 obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided
 check references of management and key personnel
 and take other reasonable investigative measures
 to the extent of the Company's limited financial resources and management expertise.

The manner in which each Company participates in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity
 the respective needs and desires of the Company and other parties
 the management of the opportunity
 and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such other management.
















With respect to any mergers or acquisitions
 negotiations with target company management will be expected to focus on the percentage of the Company which target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon
 among other things
 the target company's assets and liabilities
 the Company's shareholders will in all likelihood hold a lesser percentage ownership interest in the Company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event the Company acquires a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by the Company can be expected to have a significant
dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by the Company's then shareholders
 including purchasers in this offering.

The Company will not have sufficient funds (unless it is able to raise funds in a private placement) to undertake any significant development
 marketing and manufacturing of any products which may be acquired.

Accordingly
 following the acquisition of any such product
 the Company will
 in all likelihood
 be required to either seek debt or equity financing or obtain funding from third parties
 in exchange for which the Company would probably be required to give up a substantial portion of its interest in any acquired product. There is no assurance that the Company will be able either to obtain additional financing or interest third parties in providing funding for the further development
 marketing and manufacturing of any products acquired.

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation
 drafting and execution of relevant agreements
 disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants
 attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity the costs therefore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable.

Furthermore
 even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity
 the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.



Through a leveraged transaction
 the Company would be required to use less of its available funds for acquiring the business opportunity and
 therefore
 could commit those funds to the operations of the business opportunity
 to acquisition of other business opportunities or to other activities. The borrowing involved in a leveraged transaction would ordinarily be secured by the assets of the business opportunity to be acquired. If the business opportunity acquired is not able to generate sufficient revenues to make payments on the debt incurred by the Company to acquire that business opportunity
 the lender would be able to exercise the remedies provided by law or by contract. These leveraging techniques
while reducing the amount of funds that the Company must commit to acquiring a business opportunity
 may correspondingly increase the risk of loss to the Company. No assurance can be given as to the terms or the availability of financing for any acquisition by the Company. During periods when interest rates are relatively high
 the benefits of leveraging are not as great as during periods of lower interest rates because the investment in the business opportunity held on a leveraged basis will only be profitable if it generates sufficient revenues to cover the related debt and other costs of the financing. Lenders from which the Company may obtain funds for purposes of a leveraged buy-out may impose restrictions on the future borrowing
 distribution
 and operating policies of the Company. It is not possible at this time to predict the restrictions
 if any
 which lenders may impose or the
impact thereof on the Company.





















As of December 31
 2011

865

370
938. Further
 from inception to December 31
 2011
 the Company incurred losses of $16
309
007. These factors create substantial doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to improve its financial condition by reorganizing and acquiring a new business. However
 there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing this objective. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.





On September 12
 2012
 the Company announced the signing of a non-binding letter of intent (the &#8220;LOI&#8221;) to acquire 45% of the membership units of United Spirits
 LLC (&#8220;Spirits&#8221;) owned by the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer
 Richard DeCicco. Spirits is a two member Florida limited liability company which was formed on December 16
 2011. Spirits is a startup company that has been financed by the other managing member who has contributed cash for his member&#8217;s capital account
 plus loans to the new entity
 while Mr. DeCicco has contributed rights to certain brands and limited operating assets to Spirits
 which commenced operations on January 20
 2012. The Operating Agreement of
Spirits requires among other things that Spirits shall allocate losses pro rata to members accounts and thereafter with respect to the respective percentage interests; and then first allocate profits to members who have contributed capital contributions in cash
 or made loans that are still outstanding to that member by Spirits
 and thereafter in accordance with their percentage interests.


Spirits has had only nominal revenues and its only tangible asset consists of approximately $300
000 of branded inventory at cost. It has incurred substantive losses from operations during the startup period for incurring expenses such as payroll (including the managing members)
 promotion
 travel and entertainment and rent.


The exact nature of the acquisition is still being negotiated and the purchase price to be paid by the Company
 which was not specified in the LOI
 to Mr. DeCicco has not been agreed upon. The Company intends for Spirits to assist the Company in sourcing new brands as they are acquired or developed internally.


As material terms have yet to be negotiated or agreed to
 there is no assurance that the acquisition of membership units will close and
 if it closes
 that the terms will be favorable to the Company.





Years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010






Sales decreased by $371


 2010 to $0 for the year ended December 31
 2011. The decrease in sales for the twelve months reflects the company&#8217;s inability to raise capital and to continue its business operations. As of September 28
 2010
 the Company&#8217;s assets were sold at auction and the Company ceased its business operations. 




Cost of goods sold decreased by $235
000 or 100%
 from $235
744 for the year ended December 31
 2010 to $0 for the year ended December 31
 2011. This decrease in COGS is consistent with the cessation of the Company&#8217;s operations as the Company could not raise sufficient funds to support its business.


















Gross profit was $135
569 for the year ended December 31
 2010 and $0 for the year ended December 31
 2011
 mainly attributable to the fact that the Company ceased its business operations.

Selling
 general and administrative expenses:

Selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31
 2011 and 2010 were $0 and $1
751
982 respectively
 a decrease of $1
751
000 or 100%
 mainly attributable to the fact that the Company ceased its business operations.



Loss from operations was $105
506 for the year ended December 31
 2011 and $199
317 for the year ended December 31
 2010. The decrease in the loss from operations for the year results from the fact that the Company ceased its business operations.



Interest expense for the year ended December
 2011 and 2010 was $45
307 and $133
978
 respectively
 a decrease of $88
671 or 66%. The decrease in interest expense for the year was a result of a rate reset by our largest creditor
 and the conversion of convertible debt
 and notes to equity.







Net loss was $184
677 for the year ended December 31
 2011
 compared to $2
738
761 for the year ended December 31
 2010
 a decrease of $2
554
084 or 93%. The decrease in the net loss for the year was a result of the culmination of all the reasons previously described



















For the period from January 1 2012 through February 21
 2013
 two entity lenders (one holding $102
000 of the 0% loans payable aggregating $112
300 and one holding $10
000 of the 0% loans payable aggregating $112
300
 the $30
000 6% convertible promissory note and the $70
000 12% convertible promissory notes at December 31
 2011) paid legal
 audit and accounting
 and consulting fees on behalf of the Company. The loans are due on demand and are not memorialized.

The focus of Iconic&#8217;s efforts is to acquire or develop an operating business. Despite no active operations at this time
 management intends to continue in business and has no intention to liquidate the Parent&#160;Company. Iconic has considered various business alternatives including the possible acquisition of an existing business
 but to date has found possible opportunities unsuitable or excessively priced. Iconic does not contemplate limiting the scope of its search to any particular industry. Management has considered the risk of possible opportunities as well as their potential rewards. Management has invested time evaluating several proposals for possible acquisition or combination; however
 none
of these opportunities were pursued. Iconic presently owns no real property and at this time has no intention of acquiring any such property. Iconic&#8217;s significant expected expenses are comprised primarily of professional fees incident to its reporting requirements.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming Iconic will continue as a going concern. Iconic&#8217;s recurring losses from operations
 stockholders' deficiency and working capital deficiency
 and lack of revenue generating operations
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.

Management believes Iconic will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows
 if ever. Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for Iconic
 but cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms.





















There are no off-balance sheet arrangements between us and any other entity that have
 or are reasonably likely to have
 a current or future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.



The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expenses
 and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis
 we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2011. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable financial information about our Company's operating results and financial condition.







Certain potential conflicts of interest are inherent in the relationships between our officers and directors
 and us.

















From time to time
 one or more of our affiliates may form or hold an ownership interest in and/or manage other businesses both related and unrelated to the type of business that we own and operate. These persons expect to continue to form
 hold an ownership interest in and/or manage additional other businesses which may compete with ours with respect to operations
 including financing and marketing
 management time and services and potential customers. These activities may give rise to conflicts between or among the interests of us and other businesses with which our affiliates are associated. Our affiliates are in no way prohibited from undertaking such activities
 and neither we nor our shareholders will
have any right to require participation in such other activities.

Further
 because we intend to transact business with some of our officers
 directors and affiliates
 as well as with firms in which some of our officers
 directors or affiliates have a material interest
 potential conflicts may arise between the respective interests of us and these related persons or entities. We believe that such transactions will be effected on terms at least as favorable to us as those available from unrelated third parties.

With respect to transactions involving real or apparent conflicts of interest
 we have adopted policies and procedures which require that: (i) the fact of the relationship or interest giving rise to the potential conflict be disclosed or known to the directors who authorize or approve the transaction prior to such authorization or approval
 (ii) the transaction be approved by a majority of our disinterested outside directors
 and (iii) the transaction be fair and reasonable to us at the time it is authorized or approved by our directors.

Stockholders of Iconic Brands
 Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iconic Brands
 Inc. as of December 31
 2011
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&#8217; equity
 and cash flows for the years ended December 31
 2011. Iconic Brands
 Inc.&#8217;s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Iconic Brands
 Inc. as of December 31
 2011
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31
 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements
 the Company has limited operations and resources
 which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 the consolidated financial position of Iconic Brands
 Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31
 2010 and the results of their operations and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The accompanying financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010
 the consolidated financial statements at December 31
 2010 and for the year then ended as previously reported have been revised to reflect separately the assets and liabilities and operations of the Company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary Iconic Imports
 Inc. as discontinued operations.&#160;&#160;The reclassification
 which had no effect on previously reported consolidated total stockholders&#8217; deficiency at December 31
 2010 or consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31
 2010
 was made to conform presentation to the financial statements at December 31
 2011 and for the year then
ended.

Iconic Brands
 Inc and Subsidiary

December 31
 2011 and 2010




Iconic Brands
 Inc.
 formerly Paw Spa
 Inc. (&#8220;Iconic Brands&#8221;)
 was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 21
 2005.&#160;&#160;Our plan was to provide mobile grooming and spa services for cats and dogs.&#160;Our services were going to include bathing
 hair cutting and styling
 brushing/combing
 flea and tick treatments
 nail maintenance and beautification
 ear cleaning
 teeth cleaning
 hot oil treatments
 and massage.&#160;&#160;We did not have any business operations and failed to generate any revenues.&#160;&#160;We abandoned this business
 as we lacked sufficient capital resources.&#160;&#160;On June 10
 2009
 the Company acquired Harbrew Imports
 Ltd. (&#8220;Harbrew New York&#8221;)
a New York corporation incorporated on September 8
 1999 which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbrew Imports
 Ltd. Corp. (&#8220;Harbrew Florida&#8221;)
 a Florida corporation incorporated on January 4
 2007.&#160;&#160;On the Closing Date
 pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement
 the Company issued to the designees of Harbrew New York 27
352
301 shares of our Common Stock at the Closing
 or approximately 64% of the 42
510
301 shares outstanding subsequent to the merger.&#160;After the merger
 Harbrew New York continued as the surviving company under the laws of the state of New York and became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.


In anticipation of the merger between Iconic Brands
 Inc. and Harbrew New York
 on May 1
 2009 the Board of Directors and a majority of shareholders of Harbrew New York approved the amendment of its Articles of Incorporation changing its name to Iconic Imports
 Inc. (&#8220;Iconic Imports&#8221;).&#160;&#160;On June 22
 2009
 this action was filed with the New York State Department of State.


Prior to the merger on June 10
 2009
 Iconic Brands had no assets
 liabilities
 or business operations.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the merger has been treated for accounting purposes as a recapitalization by the accounting acquirer Harbrew New York/Iconic Imports and the financial statements reflect the assets
 liabilities
 and operations of Harbrew New York/Iconic Imports from its inception on September 8
 1999 to June 10
 2009 and are combined with Iconic Brands thereafter.&#160;&#160;Iconic Brands and its wholly-owned subsidiary Harbrew New York/Iconic Imports are hereafter referred to as the &#8220;Company&#8221;.


The Company was a brand owner of self-developed alcoholic beverages.&#160;&#160;Furthermore
 the Company imported
 marketed and sold these beverages throughout the United States and globally.


Effective June 10
 2009
 prior to the merger
 Harbrew Florida affected a 1-for-1
000 reverse stock split of its common stock
 reducing the issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 24
592
160 to 24
909
 which includes a total of 317 shares resulting from the rounding of fractional shares.&#160;&#160;All share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split.


On August 20
 2010 (see Note 6)
 the Company and Seven Cellos LLC terminated the License Agreement relating to the distribution of an alcoholic beverage known as &#8220;Danny DeVito&#8217;s Premium Limoncello&#8221;.&#160;&#160;In the year ended December 31
 2010
 this brand accounted for approximately 96% of total sales.


On August 20
 2010
 Capstone Capital Group I
 LLC
 a holder of a Promissory Note with a then remaining balance of approximately $233
000
 delivered a Formal Notice of Default to the Company demanding payment of the balance on or before September 1
 2010. On September 16
 2010
 Capstone delivered a Notification of Disposition of Collateral to the Company notifying the Company of its attachment of the Collateral (including cash
 accounts receivable
 inventories
 equipment
 and contract rights) and its intent to sell the Collateral to the highest qualified bidder in a public sale on September 28
 2010.&#160;&#160;On September 28
 2010
 Capstone acquired the Collateral in exchange for the Promissory Note at the
public auction sale; there were no other bidders.


















Iconic Brands
 Inc and Subsidiary

December 31
 2011 and 2010


On September 14
 2010 (see Note 6)
 the Second District Court of Suffolk County New York issued a Warrant of Eviction removing the Company from its Lindenhurst
 New York office and the Company ceased its business operations.

On September 23
 2011
 Iconic Imports
 Inc. (&#8220;Imports&#8221;)
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Iconic Brands
 Inc.
 filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. The Bankruptcy case is being administered under case No. 8-11-76814. The petition indicated that Imports had no assets and had liabilities of approximately $3
354
000. The case is still pending before the court.





The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a &#8220;going concern&#8221; basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However
 as of December 31
 2011
 the Company had negative working capital of $3
865
207 and a stockholders&#8217; deficiency of $7
370
938. Further
 from inception to December 31
 2011
 the Company incurred losses of $16
309
007. These factors create substantial doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to improve its financial condition by reorganizing and acquiring a new business. However
 there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in
accomplishing this objective. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.







The Financial Statements include the accounts of Iconic Brands
 Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary Iconic Imports
 Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.



The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 net of allowance for doubtful accounts
 current portion of debt
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses and other current liabilities
 and long term debt. Except for long term debt
 the fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets due to their short term maturity.

 with due consideration given to obsolescence and to slow moving items.


(h)&#160;Property

Property

 were stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.&#160;Depreciation was calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.





Revenue from product sales was recognized when all of the following criteria were met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed
 (2) the price was fixed or determinable
 (3) collectability was reasonably assured
 and (4) delivery had occurred.&#160;Persuasive evidence of an arrangement and fixed price criteria were satisfied through purchase orders.&#160;Collectability criteria were satisfied through credit approvals.&#160;Delivery criteria were satisfied when the products were shipped to a customer and title and risk of loss passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale.&#160;The Company has no obligation to accept the return of products sold other than for replacement of damaged
products.&#160;Other than quantity price discounts negotiated with customers prior to billing and delivery (which are reflected as a reduction in sales)
 the Company did not offer any sales incentives or other rebate arrangements to customers.





Shipping and handling costs were reported as selling
 general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.&#160;For the years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010
 shipping and handling costs were not material.





Advertising costs were expensed as incurred and are included in selling
 marketing
 and promotion expense.&#160;For the years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010
 advertising expenses were $0 and $0
 respectively.

Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 718
 &#8220;Compensation- Stock Compensation&#8221;.&#160;For the years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010
 stock-based compensation totaled $18
140 and $713
987
 respectively.&#160;These amounts consist of stock-based compensation given to Company officers and employees and consulting firms.





Income taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method.&#160;Current income taxes are provided in accordance with the laws of the respective taxing authorities.&#160;Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.&#160;&#160;&#160;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#160;Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the
opinion of management
 it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.








Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive securities (such as stock options
 warrants
 and convertible securities) outstanding.&#160;&#160;Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net income (loss) per share are excluded from the calculation.


For the years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010
 diluted common shares outstanding excluded the following dilutive securities as the effect of their inclusion was anti-dilutive:

 the holder shall have the option to convert the outstanding principal and interest into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.00001 per share.

While the Company has not received any notice or indication from the lender of its intention to convert the $100
000 debt (or a portion thereof)
 if the lender does elect to convert the $100
000 of debt and related accrued interest at December 31

 volatility&#160;of 100%
 and term of five years.


On April 19

No provision for income taxes was recorded in the years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010 since the Company incurred net losses in these periods.


Based on management&#8217;s present assessment
 the Company has not yet determined it to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset attributable to the future utilization of the net operating loss carryforward as of December 31
 2011 will be realized. Accordingly
 the Company has maintained a 100% valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset in the consolidated financial statements at December 31
 2011. The Company will continue to review this valuation allowance and make adjustments as appropriate.


Current United States income tax laws limit the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs. Therefore
 the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited.








The Company occupied its facilities in Freeport
 New York up until March 2009 under a month to month agreement at a monthly rent of $14

283.&#160;&#160;Provided certain conditions were met
 the Company had an option to renew the lease for an additional two years at annual rentals ranging from $92
991 to $95
781. On September 14

 including DDV&#8217;s right to accrued and unpaid royalties based upon its right to inspect Company records and conduct an audit of the Company reported agreement defined net profit.

The Company never commenced sales of the product named &#8220;The Godfather&#8221;.&#160;The second royalty payment of $100
000 due on November 1

For the periods presented
 the Company calculated agreement defined net profits from the brand to be negative and thus did not pay or accrue any royalty expense under the License Agreement. The product was never introduced to the market.


Under the License Agreement
 Tony Siragusa had the right to terminate the agreement
Company
 if the Company fails to launch the distribution of and secure availability to the general public of the beverage throughout the United States prior to June 1

The Company is party to a variety of legal proceedings brought by suppliers and creditors.&#160;&#160;We accrue for these items as losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated.&#160;&#160;Most of the amounts sought have already been provided for through previous charges to operations and are included in Company liabilities at December 31

 2010.&#160;&#160;While the results of these legal proceedings
 which principally involve debt and lease default obligations and vendor disputes

Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
 after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s &#8220;disclosure controls and procedures&#8221; (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report

 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and
(ii)&#160;accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance
 however
 that the objectives of the controls system are met
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within a company have been detected. We believe our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.




Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 the Company&#8217;s principal executive
 principal operating and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 and effected by the Company&#8217;s board of directors
 management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.


The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
 that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company&#8217;s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company&#8217;s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or
disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company&#8217;s management
 including the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2011. In making this assessment
 management used the framework in &#8220;Internal Control - Integrated Framework&#8221; promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 commonly referred to as the &#8220;COSO&#8221; criteria. Based on the assessment performed
 management believes that as of December 31
 2011
 the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO criteria. Additionally
 based on management&#8217;s
assessment
 the Company determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2011.




















During the year ended December 31
 2011
 there was no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

The Company&#8217;s management
 including the chief executive officer and principal financial officer
 do not expect that its disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.

Additionally
 controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more people or by management&#8217;s override of the control. The design of any systems of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time
 control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system
 misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Individual
persons perform multiple tasks which normally would be allocated to separate persons and therefore extra diligence must be exercised during the period these tasks are combined. Management is aware of the risks associated with the lack of segregation of duties at the Company due to the small number of employees currently dealing with general administrative and financial matters. Although management will periodically reevaluate this situation
 at this point it considers the risks associated with such lack of segregation of duties and that the potential benefits of adding employees to segregate such duties do not justify the substantial expense associated with such increases. It is also recognized the Company has not designated an audit committee and no member of the board of directors has been designated or qualifies as a financial expert. The Company will address these concerns at the
earliest possible opportunity.

Chairman
 President and Chief Executive Officer





Richard J. DeCicco

 secretary and a director of Iconic Brands
 Inc. since 2007.&#160;&#160;Mr. DeCicco also served as president of Harbrew Imports Ltd. since its inception in 1999.&#160;&#160;With over 34 years experience in the global liquor industry
 Mr. DeCicco has been a senior executive and a leader in the wine and spirits industry.&#160;&#160;Prior to his appointment at Harbrew Imports Ltd
 Mr. DeCicco was the CEO and President of Harbor Industries from 1990 to 1997. Harbor Industries is a production facility
 which handles over 2 million cases of products per year and with over 600 employees.&#160;&#160;In
addition to having been the national provider for The Paddington Corporation brands from 1990 to 1997
 Mr. DeCicco pioneered what is now known within the field as Value Added Packaging (VAP).&#160;&#160;Mr. DeCicco brings a great deal of creativity
 market savvy
 and brand development knowledge to our company.




We do not have an audit committee financial expert.&#160;&#160;We do not have an audit committee financial expert because we believe the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive.&#160;&#160;Furthermore
 because we are only beginning our commercial operations
 at the present time
 we believe the services of a financial expert are not warranted.









We do not maintain any equity incentive or stock option plan.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 we did not grant options to purchase any equity interests to any employees or officers
 and no stock options are issued or outstanding to any officers.&#160;&#160;We do
 however
 anticipate adopting a non-qualified stock option plan where we will be granting our officers options to purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements.&#160;&#160;But
 no such plan has been finalized or adopted.

























Richard DeCicco has been serving as our President
 Chief Executive Officer and a director since January 1
 2008.&#160;The terms of his compensation are set forth in his Employment agreement
 dated January 23
 2008 (&#8220;DeCicco Employment Agreement&#8221;).&#160;DeCicco Employment Agreement

 if the Company enters into an agreement and further sells any brand in the Company&#8217;s portfolio
 Mr. DeCicco will receive 5% of such sale.&#160;&#160;Mr. DeCicco is also entitled to
incentive bonus compensation
 stock and/or options in accordance with Company policies established by the Board of Directors.&#160;The agreement provides for the grant of a non-qualified ten year option to purchase up to 1
000
000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price which shall represent a discount to the market price. Mr. DeCicco has the right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days notice to the Company for any reason.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to the terms of the agreement

assets to a single purchaser or group of associated purchasers; (B) there is a sale
 exchange or disposition of 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s outstanding stock; (C) the Company terminates its business or liquidates its assets; or (D) there is a merger or consolidation of the Company in which the Company&#8217;s shareholders receive less than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the new or continuing corporation.

ITEM 13.&#160;&#160;CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE










We currently do not have a code of ethics that applies to our officers
 employees and directors
 including our Chief Executive Officer and senior executives
 however
 we intend to adopt one in the near future.





Certain potential conflicts of interest are inherent in the relationships between our officers and directors
 and us.


From time to time
 one or more of our affiliates may form or hold an ownership interest in and/or manage other businesses both related and unrelated to the type of business that we own and operate.&#160;These persons expect to continue to form
 hold an ownership interest in and/or manage additional other businesses which may compete with ours with respect to operations
 including financing and marketing
 management time and services and potential customers.&#160;These activities may give rise to conflicts between or among the interests of us and other businesses with which our affiliates are associated.&#160;Our affiliates are in no way prohibited from undertaking such activities
 and neither we nor our
shareholders will have any right to require participation in such other activities.

Further
 because we intend to transact business with some of our officers
 directors and affiliates
 as well as with firms in which some of our officers
 directors or affiliates have a material interest
 potential conflicts may arise between the respective interests of us and these related persons or entities.&#160;&#160;We believe that such transactions will be effected on terms at least as favorable to us as those available from unrelated third parties.


With respect to transactions involving real or apparent conflicts of interest
 we have adopted policies and procedures which require that: (i) the fact of the relationship or interest giving rise to the potential conflict be disclosed or known to the directors who authorize or approve the transaction prior to such authorization or approval
 (ii) the transaction be approved by a majority of our disinterested outside directors
 and (iii) the transaction be fair and reasonable to us at the time it is authorized or approved by our directors.

There were no fees for audit related services for the years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010.



For the Company&#8217;s fiscal years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010
 we were not billed for professional services rendered for tax compliance
 tax advice
 and tax planning.



The Company did not incur any other fees related to services rendered by our principal accountant for the fiscal years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010.

Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.


Effective May 6
 2003
 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that require that before our auditor is engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related service
 the engagement be:





-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the audit committee
 provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular&#160;&#160;service
&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;audit committee is informed of each service
 and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the audit committee's responsibilities to management.

We do not have an audit committee.&#160;&#160;Our entire board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. The pre-approval process has just been implemented in response to the new rules. Therefore
 our board of directors does not have records of what percentage of the above fees was pre-approved.&#160;&#160;However
 all of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the entire board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.

been prepared on a &#147;going concern&#148; basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities
in the normal course of business. However
 as of December 31
 2011
 the Company had negative working capital of $3
865
207 and
a stockholders&#146; deficiency of $7
370
938. Further
 from inception to December 31
 2011
 the Company incurred losses of $16
309
007.
These factors create substantial doubt as to the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to improve
its financial condition by reorganizing and acquiring a new business. However
 there is no assurance that the Company will be successful
in accomplishing this objective. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

with the terms of sale.&#160;&#160;The Company has no obligation to accept the return of products sold other than for replacement

are reflected as a reduction in sales)
 the Company did not offer any sales incentives or other rebate arrangements to customers.

Iconic Brands
 Inc.
 formerly Paw Spa
 Inc.
(&#147;Iconic Brands&#148;)
 was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 21
 2005.&#160;&#160;Our plan was to provide
mobile grooming and spa services for cats and dogs.&#160;&#160;Our services were going to include bathing
 hair cutting and styling
brushing/combing
 flea and tick treatments
 nail maintenance and beautification
 ear cleaning
 teeth cleaning
 hot oil treatments
and massage.&#160;&#160;We did not have any business operations and failed to generate any revenues.&#160;&#160;We abandoned this
business
 as we lacked sufficient capital resources.&#160;&#160;On June 10
 2009
 the Company acquired Harbrew Imports
 Ltd. (&#147;Harbrew
New York&#148;)
 a New York corporation incorporated on September 8
 1999 which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbrew Imports
Ltd. Corp. (&#147;Harbrew Florida&#148;)
 a Florida corporation incorporated on January 4
 2007.&#160;&#160;On the Closing Date
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement
 the Company issued to the designees of Harbrew New York 27
352
301 shares of our
Common Stock at the Closing
 or approximately 64% of the 42
510
301 shares outstanding subsequent to the merger.&#160;&#160;After
the merger
 Harbrew New York continued as the surviving company under the laws of the state of New York and became the wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company.

 on May 1
 2009 the Board of Directors and a majority of shareholders of Harbrew New York approved
the amendment of its Articles of Incorporation changing its name to Iconic Imports
 Inc. (&#147;Iconic Imports&#148;).&#160;&#160;On
June 22
 2009
 this action was filed with the New York State Department of State.


 2009
 Iconic
Brands had no assets
 liabilities
 or business operations.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the merger has been treated for accounting purposes
as a recapitalization by the accounting acquirer Harbrew New York/Iconic Imports and the financial statements reflect the assets
liabilities
 and operations of Harbrew New York/Iconic Imports from its inception on September 8
 1999 to June 10
 2009 and are
combined with Iconic Brands thereafter.&#160;&#160;Iconic Brands and its wholly-owned subsidiary Harbrew New York/Iconic Imports
are hereafter referred to as the &#147;Company&#148;.


alcoholic beverages.&#160;&#160;Furthermore
 the Company imported
 marketed and sold these beverages throughout the United States
and globally.


 2009
 prior to the merger
Harbrew Florida affected a 1-for-1
000 reverse stock split of its common stock
 reducing the issued and outstanding shares of common
stock from 24
592
160 to 24
909
 which includes a total of 317 shares resulting from the rounding of fractional shares.&#160;&#160;All
share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split.


 2010 (see Note 6)
 the Company
and Seven Cellos LLC terminated the License Agreement relating to the distribution of an alcoholic beverage known as &#147;Danny
DeVito&#146;s Premium Limoncello&#148;.&#160;&#160;In the year ended December 31
 2010
 this brand accounted for approximately
96% of total sales.


 2010
 Capstone Capital Group
I
 LLC
 a holder of a Promissory Note with a then remaining balance of approximately $233
000
 delivered a Formal Notice of Default
to the Company demanding payment of the balance on or before September 1
 2010. On September 16
 2010
 Capstone delivered a Notification
of Disposition of Collateral to the Company notifying the Company of its attachment of the Collateral (including cash
 accounts
receivable
 inventories
 equipment
 and contract rights) and its intent to sell the Collateral to the highest qualified bidder
in a public sale on September 28
 2010.&#160;&#160;On September 28
 2010
 Capstone acquired the Collateral in exchange for the
Promissory Note at the public auction sale; there were no other bidders.


 2010 (see Note 6)
 the Second
District Court of Suffolk County New York issued a Warrant of Eviction removing the Company from its Lindenhurst
 New York office
and the Company ceased its business operations.


 2011
 Iconic Imports
 Inc.
(&#147;Imports&#148;)
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Iconic Brands
 Inc.

 cash includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents
 excluding items classified as marketable securities
 include short-term
 highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash
 and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally
 only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents
 while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements
 contracts entered into with others
 or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents.

No provision for income taxes was recorded
in the years ended December 31
 2011 and 2010 since the Company incurred net losses in these periods.


the Company has not yet determined it to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset attributable to the future utilization
of the net operating loss carryforward as of December 31
 2011 will be realized. Accordingly
 the Company has maintained a 100%
valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset in the consolidated financial statements at December 31
 2011. The Company will
continue to review this valuation allowance and make adjustments as appropriate.


the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs. Therefore
the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited.
