 1983
 under the name of &#8220;L. Peck Enterprises
 Inc.&#8221; On May 27
 1999
 we changed our name to &#8220;Western Glory Hole
 Inc.&#8221; From 1990 until October 2003
 we had no business operations; we were in the development stage and were seeking profitable business opportunities. On October 30
 2003
 we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Health Enhancement Corporation (&#8220;HEC&#8221;) in exchange for 9
000
000 of our shares
 making HEC our wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with this transaction
 we changed our name to Health Enhancement Products
 Inc. On October 14
 2014
 at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company
 a proposal was passed to change the name of the Company from Health Enhancement Products
 Inc. to ZIVO Bioscience
 Inc. (&#8220;ZIVO&#8221;). On October 30
 2014
 the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) approved the name ZIVO Bioscience
 Inc. for trading purposes and the symbol change to ZIVO effective November 10
 2014.


 AZ produced and marketed a liquid dietary supplement with marginal success beginning in 2003 until sales were suspended in January of 2012.


 in place since December 2011
 determined the sole focus for the near term was to move forward with a research-based product development program. From 2012 through 2019
 we have engaged fully in such activities
 all as more fully explained herein. We hold significant intellectual property in the form of bioactive compounds
 patented applications and processes
 an optimized algal strain
 nutritional products and applications derived from our proprietary algal biomass that can find their way into food
 feed
 supplements and therapeutics.


 we have been conducting the final phase of validation for a discovery-stage bovine mastitis treatment
 studies
 which is intended to dovetail with analytics and characterization of bioactive compounds produced by the algae itself. This body of work will be submitted to Zoetis
 Inc. (ZTS) (&#8220;Zoetis&#8221;) a global animal health company
 per an option/collaboration agreement dated December 19
 2013 and amended in 2019 (fifth amendment)
 to determine if our bioactive compounds exhibit efficacy in addressing bovine mastitis
 a common condition afflicting dairy cows that results in milk production losses. Upon completion of the research
 we expect to move into negotiations regarding the option payment and subsequent licensing.


 we plan to explore our options for further licensing arrangements as they relate to poultry and other livestock
 canine joint health and potentially human cholesterol management.


 we expanded our research in 2018 and 2019 to include applications of bioactive molecules originally derived from the algal culture to other animal health conditions
 in poultry
 canine and swine. This effort
 spread out across several research laboratories working in parallel
 resulted in the successful isolation and characterization of a novel non-starch polysaccharide with exceptional properties in addressing immune modulation and inflammatory response for both animal and human use. A patent application was filed at the close of 2019.


 our business model anticipates deriving future income from licensing and selling natural ingredients that may be extracted from or are initially based on our proprietary alga1 cultures. In line with this
 on April 20
 2017
 we entered into a Limited License Agreement (the &#8220;License Agreement&#8221;) with NutriQuest
 LLC (&#8220;NutriQuest&#8221;) a recognized leader in animal health and nutrition solutions. In the License Agreement
 we granted to NutriQuest a limited
 exclusive license to market
 distribute
 sell and collect the sales proceeds in all of our nutrition
 feed additive and supplementation applications relating to naturally-derived algal biomass and extraction products for oral administration in swine and/or poultry species. As mentioned above
 we affirmed human GRAS Generally Recognized As Safe
 or &#8220;GRAS&#8221; status as a plant-based ingredient in food products for human consumption. We are in the process of garnering poultry GRAS status as a production feed ingredient and expect that approval in late 2020. We have also entered into an Exclusive Supply Agreement (the &#8220;Exclusive Supply Agreement&#8221;) with NutriChipz
 LLC (&#8220;NutriChipz&#8221;) to supply our algae as an ingredient in chips and crisps. Other applications available for out-licensing include spice mixes
 rubs and condiments. Funding is required to grow algae at commercial scale in order to meet compliance for animal feed ingredient and supply NutriQuest
 NutriChipz and others with product.





 we expect these new product formulations will likely be sold to much larger
 well-established animal
 food
 dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers. The anticipated income streams are to be generated from a) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients
 and b) bulk sales of such ingredients. We expect bulk ingredients to be made by contracted algae growers and then sold by us to animal food
 dietary supplement and food processors and/or name-brand marketers.


 we established HEPI Pharmaceuticals
 Inc. as our wholly owned subsidiary (&#8220;HEPI Pharma&#8221;). The purpose of HEPI Pharma was to develop potential pharmaceutical applications for the bioactive ingredients that may be derived from our algae cultures. 


 we formed ZIVO Biologic
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation (&#8220;ZIVO Biologic&#8221;)
 for the purpose of manufacturing and commercialization of proprietary ingredients for non-medicinal animal health applications. ZIVO Biologic is 100% owned by ZIVO Bioscience
 Inc. ZIVO Biologic is not currently conducting any operating activities.


 we acquired the assets
 consisting primarily of intellectual property rights
 of Wellness Indicators
 Inc. (&#8220;Wellness&#8221;)
 a Michigan corporation based in Illinois. Concurrently
 we formed WellMetris
 LLC as a 100% owned entity of ZIVO. In 2018
 we changed the name of WellMetris
 LLC to Wellmetrix
 LLC (&#8220;Wellmetrix&#8221;). We acquired four patent applications as part of the transaction
 in addition to engineering drawings
 prototypes
 chemical formulae
 validation data
 laboratory equipment and IT equipment. We assigned all of the intellectual property acquired to Wellmetrix with a stated value of $1
391
281. 


 manufacture
 market and sell Wellness Tests. The Wellness Tests are intended to provide individuals the information and opportunity to optimize their health and identify future health risks or to provide insurers
 employers and healthcare providers with timely information to intervene with wellness programs
 fitness regimes or other preventative measures. During the period of time we have owned Wellmetrix
 we have drafted and filed an additional fifteen patent applications around the intellectual property acquired
 as noted in the section &#8220;Patents and Proprietary Rights.&#8221; In the summer of 2014
 we evaluated the circumstances related to the original four patent applications acquired and determined that two of the existing patent applications could be improved and filed new patents applications to redefine and better protect our intellectual property. We have abandoned one of the initial four patent applications purchased
 released two of the four applications purchased and substituted them with two new patent applications
 and retained ownership of one of the four applications purchased
 which has now converted to a national phase application. In connection with the abandoned patents
 we have protected our rights with regards to the original patent applications purchased
 however we determined we should record a loss on abandonment of $1
391
281 for the year ended December 31
 2014 as the initial value of the acquired patent applications pending resides in the newly drafted and filed eight patent applications. On December 25
 2018 the U.S Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) issued Patent No. 10
161
928 &#8211;&#160;Wellness Panel
 effectively securing the core conceptual premise of the Wellmetrix technology platform.




 we filed a US patent to protect the technology in December 2019.


 which focuses on biologically active molecules initially derived from the proprietary algal culture
 we have developed a more refined strategy to define the mechanism of action for our molecules in poultry
 namely:






 when funding is available to do so. At the close of 2019
 we await data and results from a study conducted earlier in the year by long-time research collaborator Dairy Experts
 based in California. This most recent study yielded a massive amount of data
 which takes considerable time and effort to compile and analyze before any results can be announced.





 which focuses on dried algal biomass and extracts thereof
 we vastly accelerated the poultry testing schedule
 with 10 new studies initiated or completed in 2019
 versus 2 studies completed in each of the two previous years. Some of the notable findings include the following:
















 test
 manufacture and market a suite of anti-aging and skin health supplements and food products featuring our proprietary algal biomass
 pending availability of funding. Funding is required to produce sufficient biomass for clinical trials per the Letter of Intent executed by both parties.

We established an algae production base in India
 contracting ALG India Enterprices pvt LTD (&#8220;ALG India&#8221;) (fka Shibin)
 an experienced spirulina grower
 to exclusively produce ZIVO algae for export to the US. ALG India has also undertaken construction of a 25 acre facility dedicated to ZIVO algae and financed by Swedish investors
 to be completed in a phased fashion as production is scaled during the first half of 2020. Other growers and laboratories in India are being approached


 depending on available funding. To that end
 we have completed a number of studies relating to poultry production that support optimized animal nutrition. Our dried algal biomass has been classified as an animal feed material in the EU
 and testing is planned with NutriQuest in the Czech Republic in Q2 2020. 


 2019 saw continued but inconsistent funding
 resulting in start-stop of several key research initiatives and resulting delays in obtaining results and sharing with our prospective partners and potential licensees. We are continuing with our research partners to conduct classical
 non-GMO strain development to improve cultivation efficiencies for our proprietary algal strain. On the pharmaceutical side
 we are continuing work on the discovery and analytics work pertinent to the bovine mastitis therapeutic candidate
validation study. ZIVO has also expanded its poultry research after a number of successful field trials. A number of key research organizations were engaged to work on several fronts simultaneously in order to compress the timeframe and approach the tasks from different functional and analytical perspectives. The research organizations included the National Center for Natural Product Research at the University of Mississippi
 Michigan State University School of Veterinary Medicine
 University of North Carolina &#8211;&#160;Greensboro
 Iowa State University
 University of Illinois
 
 Eurofins
 SBH Biosciences
 Dairy Experts and Elicityl
 among others. The achievement of our R&amp;D goals is subject to the availability of sufficient funding.






 we have approached and are continuing to approach potential customers or licensees in the market verticals described below. The products described throughout this document are still in the development stage and are subject to development risk. There can be no assurance that any of the products described below will prove to be effective
 or if found to be effective
 will be able to be produced in a commercially viable manner. We have affirmed human GRAS in the USA and for the EU our dried algal biomass has been classified as an animal feed material. As we continue to work on regulatory around the world
 funding is required to grow algae at commercial scale in order to accomplish commercialization of our products.







 the condition affects 10% of the U.S. dairy herd at any one time
 costing producers approximately $1
100 per case. In the U.S. alone
causes a highly contagious and potentially fatal form of bovine mastitis (an infection of the mammary gland)
 for which there currently is no treatment. In the cow&#8217;s udder
 mammary epithelial cells form an immunological barrier to protect the mammary gland. When bacteria or other pathogens break through this barrier
 an infection can set in
 affecting quality and quantity of milk produced. Our compounds showed promising early results for restoration of the immunological barrier in experiments conducted 
 as conducted by the Principal Researcher at the University of Wisconsin - Madison
 Department of Dairy Science.


 2013 (as amended in 2019 &#8211;&nbsp;fifth amendment)
 we entered into a Collaboration and Option Agreement (the &#8220;Zoetis Agreement&#8221;) with Zoetis
 a global animal health company
 in connection with the prevention
 treatment
 and management of bovine mastitis. In the Zoetis Agreement
 we granted to the counterparty an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive license with us. Specifically
 upon completion of the final phases of a collaborative program
 and acceptance of the work product by Zoetis
 the Zoetis Agreement provides for a 90-day exclusivity period for evaluation of results
 followed by a 90-day period to exercise the option and negotiate an option payment.


 we intend to move on three related fronts &#8211;&nbsp;working to bring an algal feed ingredient to market in the United States and EU by amplifying the algae culture; working to produce a dietary supplement or feed additive for global consumption outside the U.S.; and
 putting ourselves in a position to license the isolated bioactive molecules to a pharmaceutical or drug development company for synthetic development as a prescribed treatment for production animal applications. The isolated bioactive molecules form the intellectual property of interest to Zoetis. The feed ingredient
 feed additive and dietary supplement are intended for other potential collaborators along with NutriQuest
 (whose agreement covers swine and/or poultry species only). During 2019
 the Company elected to focus its limited resources on poultry applications as they represent the nearest term revenue opportunities.


 which if successful could allow a relatively rapid release to production and sales as a companion animal dietary supplement. According to the Nutrition Business Journal
 the canine joint-health dietary supplement market segment tops $360 million annually in the U.S. alone. Estimates for the world market may be substantially higher
tissue explant experiment conducted by the Comparative Orthopaedics Laboratory at University of Missouri in 2016 found that direct stimulation of living canine joint tissue with our bioactive compounds protected cartilage from degradation by IL-1b
and can be produced on an efficient basis
 we intend to sell or license our product as a supplement ingredient to larger
 well-established and profitable brand names in the pet industry. We have conducted other laboratory studies simulating the effects of canine osteoarthritis with generally positive results. All of this work has been put on hold pending the availability of additional funding.


 the isolated bioactive molecules found in the amplified algae product may
 subject to successful negotiations
 be licensed to a pharmaceutical company for development as a synthetic prescription drug. We expect that the process of developing and testing such a drug could take years. Therefore
 as is common practice
 we intend to work toward negotiating an upfront discovery-stage licensing fee
 milestone payments upon each successful conclusion of a developmental phase
 followed by pre-market approval; and finally
 a steady stream of royalties in the future. The other revenue streams are generated by feed and supplement sales which may begin to be realized in 2020
 but no assurance can be provided in that regard. Much of the research and licensing progress has been and will continue to be paced by the availability of capital funding and/or debt financing (see Item 7 &#8211;&#160;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Liquidity and Capital Resources).


 we entered into the License Agreement with animal health innovator NutriQuest
 which provides nutritional services to the biggest brand names in US poultry and pork production. We have completed a number of &#8220;pen&#8221; studies (pen studies are controlled testing of our ZIVO Algae to groups of incubator chicks ranging in size from 1
000 chicks to 25
000 chicks
 ultimately up to 1 million chicks - &#8220;broilers&#8221;). In the U.S.
 broilers consume more than 61 billion pounds of feed annually. The U.S. is the third-largest poultry producing nation. Phytogenic or plant-based ingredients like ours constitute the fastest-growing segment of the global poultry feed industry
 currently generating about $780 million in sales annually
 and growing at 8% annually. We are well-positioned to take market share if we meet expected market pricing parameters. 








 functional foods
 or health foods
 represent an estimated $20 billion business in the U.S. and a $28 billion business in Europe. The Middle East
 although significantly smaller
 is growing at a rate of 12-14% annually
 followed closely by the newly affluent in China and India. These foods typically are processed products that contain one or more staple foods augmented with a variety of performance-enhancing ingredients.


 we plan to work with other suppliers in the functional food market vertical as our algae supply expands
 having engaged The Mansour Companies as brokers for sports nutrition market verticals
 and HISCO as marketing representatives for functional food ingredients in the EU and US. Additional funding is required to grow algae at commercial scale in order to supply NutriChipz
 The Mansour Companies and others with product.




 dried kelp
 Omega-3 fish oil
 resveratrol
 saw palmetto and similar supplements attests to the American public&#8217;s obsession with &#8216;natural&#8217; products. The dietary supplement business is a $24 billion industry in the U.S. alone
 and twice that the world over.


 we will endeavor to private-label the compound or finished product for larger
 well-established marketers and retailers. If we are able to accomplish this
 we believe this is a more efficient use of capital and resources
 while still retaining control of the intellectual property
 the manufacturing process and pricing power. Our goal is not to be placed in a position where our premier product application is commodified and we must compete on price.


 we have executed a letter of intent with Grekin Laboratories
 directed by Dr. Steven K. Grekin
 in a joint effort to develop
 test and launch an exclusive line of products designed to address skin health and the appearance of aging through novel combinations of all-natural ingredients featuring the ZIVO proprietary algae strain. The initial product line being readied for launch includes a nourishing complex
 fatty acid replenishment
 collagen/protein mix and phytonutrient booster. Additional funding is required to produce sufficient algal biomass for clinical trials per the Letter of Intent executed by both parties.




 during or after various medical procedures
 including surgery
 chemotherapy
 radiation therapy and physical therapy. At times
 medicinal foods are used to augment the effects of prescription drugs. These medicinal foods are expensive and typically reimbursed by health insurers. Botanical drugs can also be made available over-the- counter (OTC) after an extensive compliance program.


 or as an OTC botanical drug. These sectors are both regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). Medicinal food standards are somewhat less stringent than pharmaceutical applications. Botanical drug standards are similar to other pharmaceutical applications. Under our business model
 if we are able to produce a commercial product in these areas
 we will endeavor to enter into a private-label arrangement with a larger strategic partner to produce and distribute these product applications. Our goal is to turn over the drug candidates at discovery stage and allow the licensee to move the drug development program forward.




 complex and time-consuming. It is an undertaking well beyond our financial capabilities and one that may take several years to achieve. Our intent is to out-license the natural molecules at discovery stage and allow the licensee to develop the Investigatory New Drug (IND) filing and conduct subsequent safety/efficacy phases in order to bring a therapeutic product to market. If we elect to pursue the development of a prescription drug
 we will likely seek a partnership with a co-developer that will share in the risk and expense of the initial development process
 and then share in any royalties resulting from the licensing or sale of any synthetic molecule and its homologs we are able to develop and license. 


 licenses fees and royalty payments across animal and human applications

 manufacturing
 marketing
 and selling tests that we believe will allow individuals and their care providers to optimize personal health and identify future health risks. The information obtained will also provide insurers
 employers and healthcare providers timely information to intervene with wellness programs
 fitness regimes or other preventative measures. We plan to develop and commercialize such tests in three phases:

In phase one (&#8220;Phase One&#8221;) or
 alternately named Gen 1.0
 we plan to develop and commercialize a series of tests
 which are intended to measure indicators of good health and optimal metabolic function (collectively
 the &#8220;Phase One Test&#8221;). The Phase One Test has been designed to measure biomarkers related to oxidative stress
 inflammation
 and antioxidant status to establish a metabolic assessment from which intervention can commence
 and from which metabolic syndrome can be inferred. A patent that covers this particular combination of biomarkers was issued December 25
 2018.&#160;&nbsp;

In phase two (&#8220;Phase Two&#8221;) or alternately named Gen 1.5
 we plan to develop and commercialize a testing technology focused on the positive or negative metabolic effects of metabolizing fat and muscle efficiency due to changes in diet
 exertion
 hydration and dietary supplements in a self-administered format that integrates with smartphone operating systems.&#160;&nbsp;

In phase three (&#8220;Phase Three&#8221;) or alternately named Gen 2.0
 we plan to develop and commercialize additional tests intended to provide a more complete metabolic profile for an individual utilizing the metabolites present in urine. The Company believes the Gen 2.0 tests
 in aggregate
 will allow identification of healthy versus unhealthy bodily processes in real-time. This technology can also be applied to livestock and companion animals. As capital funding becomes available
 the Company will move forward with finalizing its transition cow syndrome test
 for which a provisional patent application has already been filed.&#160;&nbsp;




 diabetes
 autoimmune diseases and cancer. The Wellness Tests are intended to identify pre-conditions to such illnesses. Such identification may allow for early intervention and reduce incidence of such illnesses or forestall their onset. This is critically important to large employers
 insurers and governmental agencies who are payers for health claims and are facing massive increases in premiums or cash outlays.


 report
 record and manage wellness and health data for an individual or large groups such as large employers
 pension funds
 accountable care organizations
 state Medicaid agencies and their actuarial consultants
 underwriters
 re-insurers and wellness consultants. The software also contains tools to conduct meta-analysis of baseline health benchmarks and monitor the progress of pre-clinical intervention programs within large groups. We were awarded a US patent for the Company&#8217;s novel Wellness Panel
 which was announced in January of 2019.


 we attracted the attention of DSM
 a Dutch multinational that adopted a global personalized nutrition initiative and has contracted Wellmetrix to use its proprietary test platform to substantiate the healthiness of two premier DSM functional food ingredients. This represents the first revenue opportunity for Wellmetrix.


 due to funding issues
 the project with DSM cannot move forward
 as we are obliged to furnish certain study components at our own cost. Therefore
 2019 saw a renewed effort to either sell or fund independently Wellmetrix and spin it out as a free-standing business. 






 Omega-3 and antioxidants are made and marketed in a fiercely competitive
 price-sensitive market environment. Recently
 several algae producers have made health claims for their proprietary algae strains
 ranging from alternative treatment for diabetes to controlling some HIV symptoms. Proprietary products offered by some marketers are often dogged by unsubstantiated claims of product efficacy or present potential product safety issues
 which in turn draw the attention of regulators. The optimal position for a supplement and ingredient maker is when pricing power can be exerted through well-protected intellectual property and further backed by well-documented safety and efficacy claims.






 Cognis
 ConAgra
 Cargill and Nestle
 each of which has active M&amp;A efforts
 a large scientific staff and a generous R&amp;D budget to develop supplements and ingredients for a wide range of applications. However
 we intend to approach these very same competitors as potential strategic partners
 in order to leverage their specific expertise in certain food and supplement categories where a mutually beneficial relationship can be established. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective.


 the companion animal dietary supplement segment
 and specifically canine joint health
 is made up almost exclusively of chondroitin/glutathione supplements
 which have dominated that segment for more than a decade. This $360 million segment represents a potentially lucrative opportunity to introduce a completely new product if we are able to demonstrate superior benefits and produce a product at a comparable price. It is likely we will partner with an established animal health brand name.


 the animal health market as it pertains to mastitis in dairy cows
 and specifically feed ingredients that exhibit beneficial properties
 has been largely in the realm of yeast-based products. Only recently has there been a focus on algae-based alternatives
 as promoted by Alltech with its $200 million expansion of an algae facility in Kentucky. In the U.S.
 feed ingredients cannot be promoted using any form of health claim
 and dietary supplements for production animals are
 to our knowledge
 non-existent due to FDA/CVM regulation. However
 outside the U.S.
 the use of dietary supplements is widespread
 and we intend to market our refined ingredients to a worldwide market in partnership with a global brand name.




 which changes markedly throughout the day. This normalization process is included in the Wellness Panel patent issued in December 2018. Blood-based wellness tests can be even less reliable because the biomarkers for oxidative stress and inflammation are extremely dynamic and will often change before the blood can be tested
 casting doubt on the results.


 there is no guarantee that our products will be proven to be effective and commercially viable
 or that a larger
 better-financed competitor may not emerge once we begin promoting our products.






 we continue to use the AzCATI facility at Arizona State University to produce our microbial mixture for continued experimentation and as a source of inoculum to seed ponds of contracted growers overseas. Our initial approach to building a global supply chain is to approach existing spirulina algae growers. Spirulina producers can easily convert their ponds to grow the ZIVO algae strain. This would allow us to rapidly build production capacity with relatively low capital expense. Once a licensed grower supply chain is established
 we will endeavor to build larger scale facilities with joint venture partners in locations best suited for our proprietary algal strains. This is intended to provide stability and consistency in the global supply. 


 we are working with two ZIVO algae contract growers in India. We also have a Letter of Intent with a grower in Peru and anticipate approval from that Government to import our ZIVO Algae strain into Peru in the second quarter of 2020. We are actively pursuing other algae producers in other areas of the world
 including Thailand
 Viet Nam and Indonesia




 we will need two physical components to deliver our services. A dedicated
 custom reader device and a test comprised of eight (8) different chemistry tests on a single urine test panel housed in a proprietary disposable cartridge.


 custom reader device is manufactured by a third party to our specifications. We do not believe that there is a risk of supply
 as there are several manufacturers available to produce the unit.


 as there are several manufacturers available to produce the units.










 we reoriented the business model to focus on research and development in order to license our product and technology to third parties and to furnish algal biomass in bulk. Our potential customers are larger
 well-established brand names in nutrition and health who will likely combine our algal biomass with other ingredients for feed
 food and beverage applications. At this time
 there are no customers providing any revenue.




 however
 due to funding issues
 this initiative has been placed on hold for the near term.






 we produce our microbial mixture using third party laboratory facilities. We are producing ZIVO algae at contract growers in India. We have Letters of Intent to produce our ZIVO Algae in Peru upon in-country Government approval to import the ZIVO Algae strain. We are actively pursuing other algae producers in other areas of the world.

 our products are subject to extensive governmental regulations.


 these laws
 regulations and other constraints exist at the federal
 state and local levels and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. The majority of these regulations directly relate to (1) the formulation
 clinical testing
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 distribution
 sale and storage of our products and (2) product claims and advertising
 including claims and advertising by us
 as well as claims and advertising by distributors for which we may be held responsible.




 the formulation

 distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies
 primarily the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;). Our activities also are regulated by various agencies of the states and localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured
 promoted
 distributed and sold. The FDA
 in particular
 regulates the formulation
 manufacture and labeling of conventional foods
 dietary ingredients and dietary supplements (or nutraceuticals).


 drugs
 cosmetics and medical devices in the United States. To the extent that we manufacture finished products for sale to consumers (and in certain other limited circumstances where we sell our product as an ingredient)
 FDA regulations require us to comply with current good manufacturing practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) regulations for the preparation
 packing and storage of dietary supplements. This is a complex series of regulations that have posed significant compliance challenges to the supplement industry. To the extent that we supply our products as ingredients for the use in foods or nutraceuticals
 we would be required to comply with cGMP regulations for foods
 as well as the provisions of the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 which require all companies involved in the production of food and food ingredients to develop and implement a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point program.


 Drug and Cosmetic Act by recognizing &#8220;dietary supplements&#8221; as a distinct category of food and
 we believe
 is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry. The legislation grandfathered
 with some limitations
 dietary ingredients that were on the market before October 15
 1994. A dietary supplement that contains a dietary ingredient that was not on the market before October 15
 1994 will require evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that it is reasonably expected to be safe. To the extent that we offer for sale unique
 proprietary ingredients we will be required to file with the FDA evidence supporting the conclusion that we have a &#8220;reasonable expectation&#8221; that they will be safe for human consumption when used as directed. The FDA recently published an &#8220;Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking&#8221; which the nutraceutical industry believes will substantially increase the level of evidence required to satisfy the &#8220;reasonable expectation&#8221; standard.






 truthful and non- misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling
 such as statements describing general well-being from consumption of a nutraceutical ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining structure or function of the body. A company making a statement of nutritional support must possess adequate substantiating scientific evidence for the statement
 disclose on the label that the FDA has not reviewed the statement and that the product is not intended to mitigate
 treat
 cure or prevent disease
 and notify the FDA of the statement within 30 days after its initial use. To the extent we produce finished product for use by consumers as nutraceuticals
 we will be required to comply with these provisions of DSHEA.




 this category of products is subject to the Nutrition
 Labeling and Education Act (&#8220;NLEA&#8221;) and regulations promulgated under the NLEA. The NLEA regulates health claims
 ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product. The ingredients added to conventional foods must either be GRAS or be approved as food additives under FDA regulations.


 which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of our product
 has for years instituted enforcement actions against companies marketing supplements for alleged false
 misleading or unsubstantiated advertising of some of their products. The FTC has specific guides for advertising claim substantiation as well as for the use of testimonials. As a general matter
 companies making health related claims for their products or ingredients are required to possess well designed human clinical studies supporting such claims at the time they are made. Enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and significant monetary payments by the companies involved. In addition
 the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials which we have and may in the future utilize.




 we may be required to obtain an approval
 license or certification from the relevant country&#8217;s ministry of health or comparable agency. This would hold true for jurisdictions such as Canada
 the European Union
 Japan
 Australia and New Zealand. The approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredient to appropriate regulators for review of data supporting safety as well as substantiating any claims we may desire to make. We would also be required to comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations could prevent our products from being legally offered for sale.




 also known as Proposition 65
 provides that no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly discharge or release a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity into water or into land where such chemical passes or probably will pass into any source of drinking water
 without first giving clear and reasonable warning. Among other things
 the statute covers all consumer goods (including foods) sold in the State of California. Proposition 65 allows private enforcement actions (sometimes called &#8220;bounty hunter&#8221; actions). While we intend to take appropriate steps to ensure that any of our products that we may market will be in compliance with the Act
 given the nature of this statute and the extremely low tolerance limits it establishes (well below federal requirements)
 there is a risk that we
 our contracted producer or a licensee could be found liable for the presence of miniscule amounts of a prohibited chemical in our product. Such liability could be significant.




 we will continue to produce research-only feedstock for chemical analysis
 safety studies and efficacy studies compliant with applicable state and federal regulations. However
 we will rely on our research partners to conduct their respective R&amp;D programs in a manner compliant with applicable regulation and law. Once a product concept has been fully developed
 we intend to manufacture that product
 either internally or on a contract basis. We intend to adhere to all state and federal food safety and food manufacturing regulations for applicable product categories
 and to produce our algal biomass in compliance with standards set forth in our GRAS dossier. In either case
 we intend to adhere to all state and federal regulations relative to the safety and efficacy of the product application
 as well as relevant regulations covering the safe and consistent manufacture of that product.








 we affirmed GRAS status for use as a plant-based ingredient for human consumption. We are in the process of affirming poultry GRAS status and expect that approval in mid-2020. We have completed a number of studies relating to the poultry production that supports good animal nutrition. These studies are being performed in conjunction with our licensing partner
 NutriQuest
 a global innovator in animal nutrition. In the EU
 the ZIVO algal biomass has been classified as an animal feed material and testing in the EU has commenced. With appropriate funding
 we can move forward with human food ingredient compliance in 2020 utilizing all or most of the US FDA GRAS dossier.




 which have advised us as to the most time and cost-efficient path to classification and approvals. This activity will be reactivated upon availability of additional funding.



ZIVO Bioscience
 Inc.




 beginning in 2004. In spring of 2009
 we undertook a research and development process with a view to fractioning the existing product into much smaller
 concentrated groups of molecules with similar physical properties. These groups were then tested 


 we continue to develop our research programs internally and direct outside academic researchers
 private laboratories or contract research organizations to conduct experiments
 tests and studies on our behalf. We spent approximately $2

 mainly to independent facilities involved in the analysis and validation of our bioactive compounds in various applications and animal models. To date
 all of these amounts have been directly expensed as they have been incurred.

Beginning in March 2016
 the Company moved forward with the following R&amp;D initiatives

by the principal researcher at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and further validated in vivo by other researchers in the fall of 2016. The pre-pilot and pilot arms of this study have been completed. The primary arm of the study was delayed in 2018 due to inconsistencies in the testing sample
 availability of research facilities
 and delays in the analytical process. The primary study arm or a portion thereof is expected to commence in Q1 2019. The analytical work that must occur in tandem required the addition of new research resources in order to complete such work in a timely manner.&#160;&nbsp;

A study utilizing cadaver cartilage and joint tissue at the Comparative Orthopaedics Laboratory located at the University of Missouri showed positive early results for protective effects in canine joint health
 using our natural bioactive compounds. The study will be repeated and expanded when capital funding is made available.&#160;&nbsp;

A canine whole blood experiment was conducted at an international contract research organization to study the effects of our natural bioactive compounds on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines present in blood to assess whether a systemic or localized mechanism of action can be determined. Although the results trended in a positive direction
 Company principals determined that a more definitive 

The ongoing elucidation and characterization of the natural bioactive compounds had undergone a data integrity review in early 2014. Further work to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the bioactives had been placed on hold since spring of 2014 pending available funding. In mid-March 2016
 the Company re-activated the elucidation and characterization as funding became available. Several university and privater laboratories were contracted to conduct isolation
 and fractionation
 followed by bioassays or in vivo studies to validate the bioactivity of the purified and isolated samples
 with work ongoing at the close of 2019.&#160;&nbsp;




Beginning in spring 2017
 we contracted with the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi
 the Boston Institute of Biotechnology
 the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center
 Elicityl SA
 and other research facilities to accelerate the elucidation and characterization of the bioactive compounds present in the algal biomass
 with the intent to converge these findings with the in vivo validation conducted for treatment of bovine mastitis
 and present this body of work to Zoetis and effectively start the clock on the 90-day evaluation period. Such work resulted in the characterization of numerous bioactive compounds
 which requires additional screening and validation to separate bioactives pertinent to bovine mastitis from those pertinent to other human and animal models. &nbsp;

Beginning in fall 2016
 we commenced a significant number of tests to determine the nutritional composition of the algal biomass
 its toxicity
 genetic mutagenicity
 bacterial count and other safety measures for successive batches of biomass produced at AzCATI and other producers to establish consistent production and repeatability in anticipation of GRAS approvals. These tests form the basis for safety and stability claims as part of the requirement to meet GRAS standards applicable to both human and poultry uses.&#160;&nbsp;

As mentioned previously
 2019 saw a decrease in R&amp;D spending and the active recruitment of algae growers in India and Peru
 as well as other parts of the world. We engaged an outside consultant to advise us on outsourcing algae production and to develop our internal and external organizational structures to support a global supply chain in anticipation of a market launch in early 2020 pending availability of biomass from contracted growers In addition
 we worked closely with our animal feed partner NutriQuest to conduct initial trials and analyses of a potential poultry feed ingredient
 with good results. The FDA compliance effort for a poultry feed ingredient is still underway and is expected to dovetail with product availability in mid-2020.&#160;&nbsp;


 but also testing the method of isolation and then validating that the isolated molecules retain their bioactivity across a select range of human and animal cell lines
studies. We must ensure that this does not occur occasionally
 it is required for every production process
 every safety validation process and every intended application
 such as a canine dietary supplement that is mixed with food
 as opposed to a canine dietary supplement that is administered in the form of a chewable caplet.


 as we enter production scale-up
 we are required to provide cGMP protocols and Quality Assurance (&#8220;QA&#8221;) protocols that show we can produce the algal biomass and/or the active ingredients safely
 consistently and in defined quantities
 and therefore rely on these same experiments and methods to substantiate our quality claims. These datasets form the basis for establishing the value of a license agreement. Therefore
 every single license that we hope to issue requires its own data set and safety validation for the specific application being licensed. These datasets represent the core of the intellectual property that is being licensed.




 the method was not commercially viable
 and the Company has expended considerable resources to develop a single-species
 high-volume and commercially viable production methodology.


 resulting in the creation of a product platform strategy whereby four different forms could be developed for future marketing across several categories and applications:

the raw algae biomass
 which would naturally contain various nutritional and beneficial compounds; &nbsp;












 we contracted with several experts in the field to coordinate isolation of the different organisms present in the culture
 grow each of them separately and then subject them to the same life-cycle stressors as the original culture. The stated goal was to grow algae in bulk as a direct source of micro-nutrition and feed ingredient for production animals
 namely poultry
 beef cattle and dairy cows
 as well as companion animal dietary supplementation. The production capability would be licensed or contracted to others. Per the business model
 we have no intention of fielding a finished product
 but rather coordinating licensees and entering into supply agreements with larger
 better-financed brand names or licensing directly with such brand names. There can be no assurance that commercially viable products will be developed
 or that they can be successfully and profitably manufactured and marketed.


 our contracted researchers were able to successfully isolate one or more algal species
 scale up the production/output of the isolated species and still retain some of the key
 desirable bioactive properties associated with the earlier
 complex culture. Proof of concept growing techniques
 including both pond and bioreactor modes
 showed that our target algal specie can be grown in commercially viable quantities
 and the harvest time was compressed from several weeks to several days&#8217; time. We are uncertain if we can grow biomass in sufficient tonnage for livestock feed
 but we believe that the current production methods will allow us to satisfy demand for a more refined product introduced into animal feed and into human supplements as global production capacity ramps up.


 we updated Standard Operating Procedures (&#8220;SOPs&#8221;) in order to draft contractual terms with contract growers domestically and abroad. The SOPs form the basis for current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) protocols to which contract growers and processors must adhere as part of the FDA&#8217;s updated Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 requirements
 regardless of country of origin. We conducted experiments in post-processing
 such as spray-drying centrifugal water extraction and other techniques to better understand feed and food handling requirements. We contracted the Burdock Group of Orlando
 Florida in summer of 2016 to manage the compliance process on our behalf and we affirmed GRAS self-affirmation in November 2018.




&#8221; as it relates to autoimmune and anti-inflammatory response. These are very broad categories and work is still required to fully describe the 3D structure of such compounds to fully realize their potential licensing value. One approach among several we&#8217;ve taken is to create synthetic homologs
 and from them deduce the composition and 3D structure of the naturally bioactive compounds. 


 we estimate that we will
 in fiscal 2020
 be required to expend in excess of $5
000
000 on research and subsequent product development and manufacturing in order to complete the initiatives discussed herein. In addition to the activity in 2020
 we plan to continue our research and development efforts as well as manufacturing feed and food products in 2020 and beyond. These expenditures will need to be met from external funding sources as well as revenues we intend to receive. In the past
 we have had difficulty raising funds from external sources. Thus
 we may not be able to raise the funding required to continue our research and development activities. In the event that these sources are not available or adequate to meet our research needs
 we will be unable to pursue our research activities
 in which case our ability to substantiate the accumulated intellectual property with objective clinical support for its characterization
 method of action and efficacy will continue to be impeded
 thereby severely hindering our ability to generate licensing revenue (or otherwise commercialize our products) and adversely affect our operating results.


 we will continue our current research program with our research partners
 we will expand our investigations to include various experts and consultants on an as-needed basis and explore new product concepts and applications. Our current contracts with our research partners cover the following activities:

Ongoing isolation and characterization of individual natural molecules from various production formats in sufficient quantities for downstream analyses
 experiments
 standards development
 compliance
 cGMP and QA protocols
 whether as the basis for feed or food applications
 as a lead compound for a synthetic therapeutic
 or as a medical food or botanical drug&#160;&nbsp;

Ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro to substantiate efficacy and safety for each specific application or claim
 i.e.
 bovine mastitis
 poultry nutrition
 health
 canine osteoarthritis
 canine joint health
 porcine respiratory/reproductive syndrome
 etc.
 to boost value for each specific license or market vertical&#160;&nbsp;

Synthetic development/validation of individual molecules to boost value of licenses
 likely to be conducted by others
 either as licensees or joint ventures&#160;&nbsp;

Ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro for standards development
 FDA safety compliance
 cGMP and QA protocols&#160;&nbsp;




Product development initiatives such as the joint development project with NutriQuest to develop a successful poultry feed ingredient; the project with NutriChipz to develop products in the functional food market; the project with Dr. Steven K. Grekin to develop skin health
 with other partners
 to develop a protein enhancement ingredient for vegan drinks and smoothies as well as a human dietary supplement formulation&#160;&nbsp;


 and our ability to undertake all such activities is subject to our receipt of additional funding. Ancillary development activities would occur in parallel with our research partners. 






 programmatic applications of its testing and reporting platform. We are interested in supporting the intervention by wellness consultants or medical professionals in the lifestyle choices made by individuals covered by traditional health insurance plans
 retiree medical benefits pools
 employer-sponsored health initiatives and taxpayer-sponsored programs like Medicaid and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) or its proposed replacement. These interventions
 which are typically pre-clinical
 have been shown to be successful in delaying the onset of chronic diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular problems. We believe that targeting asymptomatic individuals and focusing intervention efforts on these individuals may have a positive result for wellness programs

 as compared to $17
000 in 2018. The resources were spent on external research.


 the Wellmetrix product platform required additional prototype analyzers and additional dry chemistry reagent strips and cartridges to conduct pilot programs for potential customers
 and to use the results of these pilot programs to help normalize data for the dry chemistry reagents as part of the FDA submission package.

In early 2016 we refocused product development on self-monitoring of individual health
 primarily focused on those individuals who purchase dietary supplements
 join health clubs or are otherwise actively pursuing a healthy lifestyle. Since that time
 we have redeveloped the sample collection device
 the analyzer and the mobile software application to better serve the needs of the consumer
 rather than a workplace wellness provider. In 2018
 we completed CAD design of all key components
 conducted finite element analysis of the sample collection device to make sure that it functioned as intended and prepared CAD files for low-volume tooling of key components. We successfully obtained a US patent in December 2018 for the core technology &#8211;&nbsp;a multianalyte Wellness Panel
 US Patent No. 10
161
928. We did not have the financial or scientific resources to complete all aspects of the testing assay
 which requires additional development before it is ready for production
 or the mobile software application
 pending available funding. Estimated funding required to successfully launch the technology is expected to reach $12 million. 


 we entered negotiations with Dutch multinational DSM to apply Wellmetrix testing technology to two premier functional food ingredients manufactured by DSM. A Research and Development Agreement was entered into with DSM in the third quarter of 2019 and a large clinical trial using the Wellmetrix Wellness Panel platform has been planned for mid-2020. As part of the contracted work
 Wellmetrix is obliged to gear up its operations to run the clinical trial and manufacture sufficient testing material and test components to conduct the clinical trial. This will require new funding
 but it does represent the first revenue opportunity for the company and therefore efforts are focused on moving forward with this relationship.






 in all material respects
 in compliance with local
 state
 and federal environmental laws applicable to our production and waste disposal. The cost of this compliance activity to date has not been material and has been absorbed within our general operations overhead.




 2019
 we had five full-time employees
 four of whom are positioned in executive management. In addition
 we have two part-time people acting on a consulting basis in administrative roles. We believe that our employee relations are good. No employee is represented by a union.








 quarterly and current reports
 and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our filings with the SEC can be viewed at www.sec.gov.





Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our consolidated financial statements which states that the consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and further states that our recurring losses from operations
 stockholders&#8217; deficit and inability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Unless and until we realize licensing and royalty revenues sufficient to cover our expenses
 we will be reliant upon external sources to fund our continued operations. We estimate that we will require approximately $6
000
000 in cash over the next 12 months in order to fund our normal operations and to fund our research and development initiatives. There is no guarantee that we will receive this funding. If we are unable to raise additional funds
 there will be a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

As of December 31
 2019
 we had 394
688
456 shares outstanding. We also had contractual commitments to issue 375
105
341 additional shares as of December 31
 2019
 consisting of 75
950
501 common shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debentures and related accrued interest and 299
154
840 common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants. This totals a potential 769
793
797 shares outstanding if all debentures were converted and warrants exercised. In order to increase the authorized shares to a higher number
 we would need to amend our articles of incorporation
 which would require stockholder approval. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the stockholder approval necessary to amend our articles of incorporation to increase our authorized shares.

We do not have resources to pursue the development
 manufacturing and marketing of products on our own
 and we will need to rely on third parties for some of these activities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully establish strategic partnerships.

The ability to market our product is dependent upon the completion of proven
 clinical research. 
 there is no guarantee that the research will successfully achieve this goal. If our current research does not return the results we expect
 our business prospects will be materially and adversely affected.

Nutraceutical and animal supplement products
 although not subject to FDA approval
 must follow strict guidelines in terms of production and advertising claims. Our ability to produce and successfully market our products is dependent upon adhering to these requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable government regulations concerning the production and marketing of our product
 we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties
 which would have a material adverse effect on our business.

We have a history of losses
 we expect to continue to incur losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. 
 if and when we do become profitable
 we will sustain profitability. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet our financial targets
 become profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows
 investors could lose their investment.

We compete with a wide range of established companies in a variety of different markets
 all of whom have substantially greater name recognition and resources than we do. We face or will face other specialized competitors if we are able to expand into new vertical markets. These competitors may be more efficient and successful than we are. If we fail to compete successfully
 our operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.





The future success of our business depends upon our ability to meet regulatory requirements for the sale of our products. Increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations
 as well as any laws
 regulations
 or changes that may be adopted or implemented in the future
 could limit our ability to market our products.

Our success depends in part upon the continued service of our senior management personnel. Our success will also depend on our future ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical
 managerial and marketing personnel. The market for qualified personnel has historically been
 and we expect that it will continue to be
 intensely competitive. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. The loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In recent years
 there has been significant litigation in the U.S. and elsewhere involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement
 misappropriation or other violations of patents
 copyrights
 trademarks
 trade secrets or other intellectual property rights. These risks have been amplified by an increase in the number of third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation. Additionally
 the defense or prosecution of claims could be time-consuming and could divert our management&#8217;s attention away from the execution of our business plan.




 any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts or obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim
 or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain a license from the third patty asserting the claim on commercially reasonable terms
 that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis
 or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering
 and our customers to continue using
 our affected products or technology. In addition
 we may be required to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims
 which would increase the cost to us. An adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our products or services to others. Infringement claims asserted with or without merit against us may have an adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.


 such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party
 an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our technology in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Moreover
 such infringement claims with or without merit may harm our relationships with our existing customers and may deter others from dealing with us.

Our ability to compete effectively is dependent in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. While we hold seven issued patent and pending patent applications covering certain elements of our technology
 these patents
 and
 more generally
 existing patent laws
 may not provide adequate protection for portions of the technology that are important to our business. In addition
 our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents.


 copyright
 trademark and trade secret laws offer us only limited protection and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent. Accordingly
 defense of our trademarks and proprietary technology may become an increasingly important issue as we seek to expand our product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection than the U.S. Policing unauthorized use of our trademarks and technology is difficult and the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the trademarks or technology on which we rely. If competitors are able to use our trademarks or technology without recourse
 our ability to compete would be harmed and our business would be materially and adversely affected.


 the reduction or loss in intellectual property protection for our technology
 the diversion of our management&#8217;s attention and harm to our reputation
 any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends
 you could receive a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has increased when you sell your shares.




Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market
 or the perception that these sales could occur
 could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity securities. We have outstanding warrants and convertible debt that may result in substantially more outstanding shares
 which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.

We have not finished developing our products or sold any products. We have only begun test marketing. We cannot be assured that there is a sufficient market demand for our products. In addition
 while we are actively pursuing the relationships necessary to begin manufacturing and marketing the Wellness Tests
 we have not yet finalized agreements with potential business partners
 including third-party resellers
 labs or distributors of the Wellness Tests. Failure to secure these critical alliances on reasonable terms could negatively impact us
 our business and future plans.

We do not own or operate
 and currently do not plan to own or operate
 manufacturing facilities for production of tests or devices which are critical to the successful operation of the business. We plan to target manufacturers and to form alliances for the mass production of our products
 but we have no assurance that such alliances will be established. Furthermore
 once we enter into such relationships
 we may not have sufficient long-term agreements with any third-party manufacturers to ensure adequate supply and price controls. This may result in delays
 quality control issues
 additional expenses
 and failure to meet demand or other customer obligations or needs.

The success of our products is contingent upon one or more third parties manufacturing products according to design specifications. In practice
 this is difficult to enforce and guarantee. As a result
 we may never realize the expected efficiency
 quality or sensitivity of our products and
 as a result
 may be required to continue research and development with another manufacturer. If a joint venture partner or contractor fails to meet design specifications
 we will experience delays in commencing operations or delays in fulfilling orders in the future. Such delays could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.

The Company is carefully monitoring the effects the COVID-19 global pandemic is having on its operations. &nbsp;Currently
 the main potential effect is the uncertainty of the Company&#8217;s ability to raising capital. &nbsp;Based on the nature of our operations
 employees are able to work remotely with access to teleconferencing and video conferencing. &nbsp;The research partners utilized by the Company are currently providing services as requested
 although some University researchers have limited availability as their campuses have closed down
 with the expectation they will reopen sometime in April 2020. &nbsp;However
 the Company cannot make any assurances the research partners will open as expected and perform at the levels as required until the COVID-19 situation is resolved. Other contract research organizations have remained open and accessible
 although some resources have delayed response effectiveness.

 as amended (&#8220;the Act&#8221;) or Section 4(a)(2) under the Act
 based on the following facts: in each case
 there was no general solicitation
 there was a limited number of investors
 each of whom was an &#8220;accredited investor&#8221; (within the meaning of Regulation D under the Act
 as amended) and/or was (either alone or with his/her purchaser representative) sophisticated about business and financial matters
 each such investor had the opportunity to ask questions of our management and to review our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission

 we have put in place a business model in which we would derive future income from licensing and selling natural bioactive ingredients that may be derived from or are initially based on the algae cultures. We expect that these planned new products will likely be sold to much larger
 better-financed animal
 food
 dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers. The anticipated income streams are to be generated from a) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients
 and b) a toll on bulk sales of such ingredients. These bulk ingredients will likely be made by contracted ingredient manufacturers and then sold by us to animal food
 dietary supplement and medical food processors and/or name-brand marketers. Further
 we expect to license our bioactive molecules as lead compounds or templates for synthetic variants intended for therapeutic applications.


 we are developing
 with the intention to manufacture
 market
 and sell tests
 that we believe will allow people to optimize their health and identify future health risks. We plan to develop and commercialize such tests in three phases:

In phase one (&#8220;Phase One&#8221;) or
 alternately named Gen 1.0
 we plan to develop and commercialize a series of tests
 which are intended to measure indicators of good health and optimal metabolic function (collectively
 the &#8220;Phase One Test&#8221;). The Phase One Test is being designed to measure biomarkers related to oxidative stress
 inflammation
 and antioxidant status to establish a metabolic assessment from which intervention can commence
 and from which metabolic syndrome can be inferred. A patent that covers this particular combination of biomarkers was issued December 25
 2018.&#160;&nbsp;

In phase two (&#8220;Phase Two&#8221;) or alternately named Gen 1.5
 we plan to develop and commercialize a testing technology focused on the positive or negative metabolic effects of metabolizing fat and muscle efficiency due to changes in diet
 exertion
 hydration and dietary supplements in a self-administered format that integrates with smartphone operating systems. &nbsp;

In phase three (&#8220;Phase Three&#8221;) or alternately named Gen 2.0
 we plan to develop and commercialize additional tests intended to provide a more complete metabolic profile for an individual utilizing the metabolites present in urine. The Company believes the Gen 2.0 tests
 in aggregate
 will allow identification of healthy versus unhealthy bodily processes in real-time. This technology can also be applied to livestock and companion animals. As capital funding becomes available
 the Company will move forward with finalizing its transition cow syndrome test
 for which a provisional patent application has already been filed.&#160;&nbsp;

076
000 in 2019 compared to $1
353
000 in 2018. Of this $2
723
000 increase
 approximately $2
524
000 related to an increase in non-cash expenses as noted below
 leaving an increase in cash expenses of approximately $199
000. General and administrative expenses increased in the following areas: an increase in salaries of $2
584
000
 of which is $2
636
000 is due to an award in 2019 of 29 million stock options to the CEO (a non-cash expense)
 an increase in salary expenses of $75
000
 offset by awards in 2018 of stock warrants to the Vice President &#8211;&#160;Operations valued at $121
000 (a non-cash expense) and a decrease of the value of stock warrants issued to the CFO of $6
000 (a non-cash expense)
 an increase in recruiting expense of $66
000 for the Vice President of Global Operations
 an increase of $55
000 in insurance expense
 an increase in Wellmetrix operating expenses of $42
000 mainly relating to a recruiting expense for the Executive Vice-President of Operations and Product Development
 an increase of $25
000 in travel expenses and an increase of $15
000 of office expenses
 offset by a reduction of $64
000 web-site development and public relations. Our increase in related cash expenses of general and administrative expenses was due to increased activity.




000 to $1
969
000 in 2019 compared to $1
962
000 in 2018. Professional fees and consulting expense increased in 2019 due to the following: an increase of $931
000 in the use of financial consultants (of the total expense of $1
011
000 in 2019 related to these activities
 $737
000 was a non-cash expense in the forms warrants issued for services rendered) and an increase in general legal fees of $165
000 offset by a decrease of $798
000 in the use of an investment banking firm and investor relations (of which $620
000 of the expense in 2018 was in the form of warrants - a non-cash expense)
 a decrease in Board of Director Fees of $191
000 (the decrease was in the value of non-cash expense in the form of 2
500
000 common stock warrants valued at $192
614 in 2019 compared to $384
065 in 2018 issued for services rendered)

 respectively
 are costs associated with external research relating to Zivo. Subject to the availability of funding
 our research and development costs will grow as we work to complete the research in the development of natural bioactive compounds for use as dietary supplements and food ingredients
 as well as biologics for medicinal and pharmaceutical applications in humans and animals. The Company&#8217;s scientific efforts are focused on the metabolic aspects of oxidation and inflammation
 with a parallel program to validate and license products for healthy immune response. The decrease of $508
000 from the prior period can be attributed to a decrease in available funding. We expect external research and development to increase in 2020 as we pursue additional external trials
 subject to the availability of sufficient funding
 which we do not currently have.


 LLC subsidiary
 we incurred approximately $101
000 and $17
000 in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The R&amp;D effort to date has centered on optimizing dry chemistry
 developing lower-cost alternatives for the proprietary analyzer device
 negotiating and collaborating with offshore manufacturers and assembling the FDA pre-submission package for product classification and approval. The increase of $84
000 from the prior period is due to prioritization of Wellmetrix research.




 2019
 we recorded approximately $375
000 relating to amortization of debt discount as compared to $903
000 for the year ended December 31
 2018
 a decrease $528
000. The decrease is related to the funding expenses of the convertible debt and the valuation related to the debt discount calculation. The discounts are amortized on a straight-line basis through April 1
 2019.


 2019
 we recorded $-0- in finance costs as compared to $97
000 in 2018. The decrease of $97
000 was due to a decrease in convertible debt funding in 2019 as compared with 2018.


 2019
 we recorded $-0- in finance costs paid in stock and warrants as compared to $311
000 in 2018. The increase of $311
000 was due to a decrease in convertible debt funding in 2019 as compared to 2018.






 2019
 we recorded approximately $2
783
000 in interest expense as compared to $7
194
000 in 2018
 a decrease of $4
411
000. Included in interest expense is the amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately $1
189
000 and $5
093
000
 respectively. The decrease of $4
411
000 is due to: 1) no new funding of convertible debt in 2019
 2) the conversion of $17
274
350 in principal and interest of Convertible Debt to HEP Investments (a related party) over the course of 2019
 3) conversion of $311
836 of Loan Payable-Related Party and accrued interest
 4) the amortization of the remaining deferred finance costs from 2018 offset by 5) the issuance to HEP Investments a warrant to purchase 2
000
000 shares of common stock valued at $165

 which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the reasons discussed herein
 there is a significant risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern
 in which case
 you would likely suffer a total loss of your investment in our company.


 2020
 we had cash in the bank of $14
000. We have incurred significant net losses since inception
 including a net loss of approximately $11
427
000 during the year ended December 31
 2019. We have
 since inception
 consistently incurred negative cash flow from operations. During the year ended December 31
 2019
 we incurred negative cash flows from operations of approximately $3
707
000. As of December 31
 2019
 we had a working capital deficiency of $8
338
483 and a stockholders&#8217; deficiency of $8
338
483. Although we recently raised a limited amount of capital
 we have a near term need for significant additional capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.


 2019
 our operating activities used approximately $3
707
000 in cash
 compared with $5
007
000 in cash during the comparable prior period. The approximate $1
300
000 decrease in cash used by our operating activities was due primarily to the following (all of which are approximated): a $3
209
000 decrease in net loss
 an increase of $542
000 in cash expense offset by a decrease in non-cash expenses of $2
451
000. The $542
000 of increase in cash expense was due to the following: an increase of accounts payable of $1
113
000
 an increase of prepaid expenses of $7
000
 offset by a decrease of $578
000 in accrued liabilities (mainly composed of the decrease in accrued interest).


 2019 and 2018
 there were no investing activities.


 2019 and 2018
 our financing activities generated $3
665
000 and $5
078
000 in cash
 respectively. The decrease of $1
413
000 was primarily related to a net increase of proceeds of $199
000 from issuance of common stock and exercise of common stock warrants
 an increase of $250
000 in net loans from related parties
 an increase in deferred finance costs of $107
000 offset by a decrease of $1
969
000 from issuance of convertible debentures.


 we continue to experience a shortage of capital
 which is materially and adversely affecting our ability to run our business. As noted above
 we have been largely dependent upon external sources for funding. We have in the past had difficulty in raising capital from external sources. We are still heavily reliant upon external financing for the continuation of our research and development program.


000
000 in cash over the next 12 months in order to fund our normal operations and to fund our research and development initiatives. Based on this cash requirement
 we have a near term need for additional funding. Historically
 we have had substantial difficulty raising funds from external sources; however
 we recently were able to raise a limited amount of capital from outside sources. If we are unable to raise the required capital
 we will be forced to curtail our business operations
 including our research and development activities.




 the main potential effect is the uncertainty of the Company&#8217;s ability to raising capital. &nbsp;Based on the nature of our operations
 employees are able to work remotely with access to teleconferencing and video conferencing. &nbsp;The research partners utilized by the Company are currently providing services as requested
 although some University researchers have limited availability as their campuses have closed down

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Based on their evaluation as of December 31
 2019
 our Chief Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act
 were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and instructions for Form 10-K. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our Chief Financial Officer
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.&#160;&nbsp;

Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019. In making this assessment
. Based on our assessment of those criteria
 management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019.&#160;&nbsp;

This Management&#8217;s report is not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Actor otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section
 unless we specifically state in a future filing that such report is to be considered filed.




Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the year ended December 31
 2019 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.&#160;&nbsp;

 stockholders' deficiency
 and cash flows
 for each of the two years in the period ended December 31

 whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.


 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


 the Company has incurred significant operating losses for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 and
 as of December 31
 2019
 has a significant working capital and stockholders&#8217; deficiency. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards. Since the Company has a history of losses
 and it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized
 a full valuation allowance has been established. In addition
 utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards is subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the &#8220;change in ownership&#8221; provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carry-forwards before utilization.

Under the provisions of FASB ASC 718
 stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award&#8217;s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Company
 from time to time
 issues common stock or grants common stock options and warrants to its employees
 consultants and board members. At the date of grant
 the Company determines the fair value of the stock option award and recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period. Issuances of common stock are valued at the closing market price on the date of issuance and the fair value of any stock option or warrant awards is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model.

 option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions
 including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company&#8217;s employee options and warrants have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate
 in management&#8217;s opinion the existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the warrants.

511 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following assumptions: volatility 180.13%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.65%. As a result of this issuance
 any further potential obligation to pay a M&amp;A transaction fee relating to warrants to purchase shares of common stock would be equal to 0.5% of the post financing fully shares outstanding at an exercise price equal to the valuation / share price of the financing (see Note 8 &#8211;&#160;Stockholders&#8217; Deficiency).


 2019
 effective July 9
 2019
 the Company entered into an agreement with a Financial Advisor. The Financial Advisor has been engaged in an exclusive arrangement in connection with the proposed securities offering and sale of up to $35 million of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock. The Company has agreed to pay the Financial Advisor
 upon the acceptance of a successful funding transaction
 a fee of 1% of the aggregate value of the transaction and a warrant to purchase up to 6
000
000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.10 for a term of five years. As of December 31
 2019
 in connection with this agreement
 no successful funding transactions have taken place and no warrants have been issued.




 2019
 the Company entered into a Supply Chain Consulting Agreement with a consultant (&#8220;Consultant&#8221;) (see Note 8 &#8211;&nbsp;Stockholders&#8217; Deficiency). In May 2019
 the Company issued a supplemental warrant to purchase 5
000
000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.08 for a term of five years to the Consultant. The warrants were valued at $529
023 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following assumptions: volatility 181.49%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.34%. In October 2019
 2
000
000 of those warrants were returned to the Company resulting in a reduction in the value of $211
609. On September 14
 2019
 the parties entered into a First Amendment to the Supply Chain Consulting Agreement (&#8220;Supply Consulting Agreement Amendment&#8221;). The Supply Consulting Agreement Amendment provides that the Consultant will identify and help negotiate the terms of potential joint ventures involving algae production development projects or related transactions or business combinations (&#8220;Development Project&#8221;). The Supply Consulting Agreement provides for exclusivity in Southeast Asia; Oceania; Indian subcontinent; and Africa; with regions in the Middle East by mutual agreement. The closing of a Development Project (as acceptable to the Company) is defined as the date that the Company is able
 financially and otherwise
 to proceed with engineering and construction of algae production facilities
 processing or warehousing facilities and supply chain development
 or related business combinations rendering an equivalent outcome (in the reasonable determination of the Company)
 for the production
 processing
 transport
 compliance
 marketing and resale of its proprietary algae biomass. Upon the closing of a Development Project
 the Company will pay cash fees of $300
000 to Consultant
 pay an on-going monthly fee of $50
000 for 24 months and issue to Consultant a cashless warrant with a five-year term to purchase nineteen million (19
000
000) shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share. As of December 31
 2019
 the Development Project has not closed
 and the warrants have not yet been issued. The Board of Directors has also authorized the Company to issue to Consultant a cashless warrant with a five-year term to purchase 1
000
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share at its discretion. As of December 31
 2019
 such warrant has not been issued.

000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.11 with a term of 5 years to the Executive Director of Asia Operations (a consultant). The Executive Director of Asia Operations is the spouse of the Chief Financial Officer. The Executive Director of Asia Operations is contracted on a month to month basis.










 2018 the Company had available net-operating loss carry-forwards for Federal tax purposes of approximately $76
746
000
 which may be applied against future taxable income
 if any
 at various dates from 2019 through 2039. Certain significant changes in ownership of the Company may restrict the future utilization of these tax loss carry-forwards.


 2019 the Company had a deferred tax asset of approximately $20
721
000 representing the benefit of its net operating loss carry-forwards. The Company has not recognized the tax benefit because realization of the tax benefit is uncertain and thus a valuation allowance has been fully provided against the deferred tax asset. The difference between the Federal and State Statutory Rate of 27% and the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate of 0% is due to an increase in the valuation allowance of approximately $3
788
000 in 2019.

 the main potential effect is the uncertainty of the Company&#8217;s ability to raising capital. &nbsp;Based on the nature of our operations
 employees are able to work remotely with access to teleconferencing and video conferencing. &nbsp;The research partners utilized by the Company are currently providing services as requested
 although some University researchers have limited availability as their campuses have closed down
 with the expectation they will reopen sometime in April 2020. &nbsp;However
 the Company cannot make any assurances the research partners will open as expected and perform at the levels as required until the COVID-19 situation is resolved. Other contract research organizations have remained open and accessible
 although some resources have delayed response effectiveness.

ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS OF PROVISIONS OF OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
 BYLAWS AND NEVADA LAW


 Bylaws and Nevada Law that could have an effect of delaying
 deferring
 or preventing a change in control of the Company.






 Title 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes
 or NRS.


 inclusive
 of the NRS
 generally prohibit a Nevada corporation with at least 200 stockholders from engaging in various &#8220;combination&#8221; transactions with any interested stockholder for a period of two years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder
 unless the transaction is approved by the board of directors prior to the date the interested stockholder obtained such status or the combination is approved by the board of directors and thereafter is approved at a meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of stockholders representing at least 60% of the outstanding voting power held by disinterested stockholders
 and extends beyond the expiration of the two-year period
 unless:






consideration to be paid by the interested stockholder is at least equal to the highest of: (a) the highest price per share paid by the interested stockholder within the two years immediately preceding the date of the announcement of the combination or in the transaction in which it became an interested stockholder
 whichever is higher
 (b) the market value per share of common stock on the date of announcement of the combination and the date the interested stockholder acquired the shares
 whichever is higher
 or (c) for holders of preferred stock
 the highest liquidation value of the preferred stock
 if it is higher.&nbsp;


 lease exchange
 mortgage
 pledge
 transfer
 or other disposition
 in one transaction or a series of transactions
 with an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; having: (a) an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation
 (b) an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation
 (c) 10% or more of the earning power or net income of the corporation
 and (d) certain other transactions with an interested stockholder or an affiliate or associate of an interested stockholder.


 an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; is a person who
 together with affiliates and associates
 owns (or within two years
 did own) 10% or more of a corporation&#8217;s voting stock. The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and
 accordingly
 may discourage attempts to acquire our Company even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price.




 inclusive
 of the NRS apply to &#8220;issuing corporations&#8221; that are Nevada corporations with at least 200 stockholders
 including at least 100 stockholders of record who are Nevada residents
 and that conduct business directly or indirectly in Nevada. The control share statute prohibits an acquirer
 under certain circumstances
 from voting its shares of a target corporation&#8217;s stock after crossing certain ownership threshold percentages
 unless the acquirer obtains approval of the target corporation&#8217;s disinterested stockholders. The statute specifies three thresholds: one-fifth or more but less than one-third
 one-third but less than a majority
 and a majority or more
 of the outstanding voting power.


 once an acquirer crosses one of the above thresholds
 those shares in an offer or acquisition and acquired within 90 days thereof become &#8220;control shares&#8221; and such control shares are deprived of the right to vote until disinterested stockholders restore the right. These provisions also provide that if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired a majority or more of all voting power
 all other stockholders who do not vote in favor of authorizing voting rights to the control shares are entitled to demand payment for the fair value of their shares in accordance with statutory procedures established for dissenters&#8217; rights.


 or &#8220;opt out&#8221; of
 the control share provisions by making an election in its articles of incorporation or bylaws
 provided that the opt-out election must be in place on the 10th day following the date an acquiring person has acquired a controlling interest
 that is
 crossing any of the three thresholds described above. We have not opted out of the control share statutes
 and will be subject to these statutes if we are an &#8220;issuing corporation&#8221; as defined in such statutes.


 and those acting in association with the acquiring person
 will obtain only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders at an annual or special meeting. The Nevada control share law
 if applicable
 could have the effect of discouraging takeovers of our Company.




 and shall hold such office until his successor is duly elected and qualified. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by an election at an annual meeting
 or at a special meeting of stockholders called for that purpose. A director chosen to fill a position resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall hold office only until the next election of directors by the stockholder.


 with or without cause
 by the vote or written consent of stockholders representing not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock entitled to voting power.







 we may increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares or the number of shares of any class we have authority to issue at any time. The board shall have authority to establish more than one class or series of shares of this corporation
 and the different classes and series shall have such relative rights and preferences
 with such designations
 as the board may by resolution provide. Issuance of such a new class or series could
 depending upon the terms of the class or series
 delay
 defer
 or prevent a change of control of the Company.




 as applicable
 before a meeting of stockholders. These provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before the annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations at the annual meeting of stockholders.








 unless the corporation&#8217;s articles of incorporation provide otherwise
 a director or officer will not be individually liable unless it is proven that (i) the director&#8217;s or officer&#8217;s acts or omissions constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties
 and (ii) such breach involved intentional misconduct
 fraud
 or a knowing violation of the law.


 judgments
 fines
 and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a threatened
 pending
 or completed action
 suit
 or proceeding
 if the officer or director (i) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138
 or (ii) acted in good faith and in a manner the officer or director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and
 if a criminal action or proceeding
 had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the officer or director was unlawful. Section 78.7502 of the NRS requires a corporation to indemnify a director or officer that has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action or suit. Section 78.7502 of the NRS precludes indemnification by the corporation if the officer or director has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction
 after exhaustion of all appeals
 to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation
 unless and only to the extent that the court determines that in view of all the circumstances
 the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and requires a corporation to indemnify its officers and directors if they have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any claim
 issue
 or matter resulting from their service as a director or officer.


 suit
 or proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of final disposition thereof
 upon determination by the stockholders
 the disinterested board members
 or by independent legal counsel. If so provided in the corporation&#8217;s articles of incorporation
 bylaws
 or other agreement
 Section 78.751 of the NRS requires a corporation to advance expenses as incurred upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the company.

 which shall remain the property of the Company and be available to the Company at all times. At the Company&#8217;s request
 Employee shall promptly sign and deliver all documents necessary to vest in the Company all right
 title and interest in and to any Inventions. If the Company is unable
 after reasonable effort
 to secure Employee&#8217;s signature on any document needed to vest in the Company all right
 title and interest in and to any Inventions
 whether because of Employee&#8217;s physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever
 Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Employee&#8217;s agent and attorney-in-fact
 to act for and in Employee&#8217;s behalf and stead to execute and file any such document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and enforcement of patents
 copyrights or similar protections with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Employee.&nbsp;



Employee acknowledges and agrees that he shall treat all Confidential Information (as defined below) in a confidential manner
 not use any Confidential Information for his own or a third party&#8217;s benefit and not communicate or disclose
 orally or in writing
 any Confidential Information to any person
 either directly or indirectly
 under any circumstances without the prior written consent of the Company. Employee further agrees that he shall not utilize or make available any Confidential Information
 either directly or indirectly
 in connection with his solicitation of employment or acceptance of employment with any third party. Employee further agrees that he will promptly return (or destroy if it cannot be returned) to Company all written or other tangible evidence of any Confidential Information and any memoranda with respect thereto which are in his possession or under his control upon Company&#8217;s request for the return of such items.&nbsp;

For the purposes of this Agreement

 including
 but not limited to
 processes
 ideas
 techniques
 Inventions
 methods

 customers
 suppliers or trade secrets. All information which Employee has a reasonable basis to believe to be Confidential Information
 or which Employee has a reasonable basis to believe the Company or any of its Affiliates treat as Confidential Information

 information shall not be deemed to be Confidential Information if it is generally known and publicly available
 without the fault of Employee and without the violation by any person of a duty of confidentiality or any other duty owed to any Protected Party.&nbsp;

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent disclosure of Confidential Information or the making of statements
 as may be required by applicable law or regulation
 or pursuant to the valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or an authorized government agency
 such disclosure or statements will be limited to the extent and only in the instances Employee is so compelled and
 subject to the requirements of applicable law
 Employee agrees to give the Company prior written notice of his intent to so disclose such Confidential Information or make any such statements and to cooperate with the Company (at the Company&#8217;s sole cost and expense) in seeking confidentiality protections or resisting such compulsion as requested by the Company. &nbsp;





Further
 notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement: (i) Employee is advised that an individual will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for any disclosure of a trade secret that is made: (1) in confidence to a federal
 state
 or local government official
 either directly or indirectly
 or to an attorney and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding; and (ii) if a person files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law
 that person may disclose the Company&#8217;s trade secrets to his or her attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if that person (1) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (2) does not disclose the trade secret
 except pursuant to court order.&nbsp;



 above (collectively
&#8221;) are reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects and are necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and its Affiliates
 that the Company would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such restrictions
 and that any violation of Restrictive Covenant could result in irreparable injury to the Company. Employee further represents and acknowledges that (i)&#160;he has been advised by the Company to consult his own legal counsel in respect of this Agreement
 and (ii)&#160;that he has had full opportunity
 prior to execution of this Agreement
 to review thoroughly this Agreement with his counsel.&nbsp;

The parties intend that the Restrictive Covenants shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants
 one for each and every political subdivision of each country
 state
 province and county
 as applicable in the world. If any court determines that any Restrictive Covenant
 or any portion thereof
 is invalid or unenforceable
 the remainder of the Restrictive Covenants shall not be affected and shall be given full force and effect
 without regard to the invalid covenant or the invalid portion. If any court determines that any Restrictive Covenant
 or any portion of any such covenant
 is unenforceable because of its duration or geographic scope
 such court shall have the power to reduce such duration or scope
 as the case may be
 and enforce such covenant or portion in such reduced form. The parties intend to and hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the courts of any jurisdiction in which Employee is alleged to have committed an act in violation of any of the covenants contained here. If the courts of any one or more of such jurisdictions hold the Restrictive Covenants
 or any portion thereof
 unenforceable
 it is the intention of the parties that such determination not bar or in any way affect the right of the Company to the relief provided above in the courts of any other jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such Restrictive Covenants as to breaches of such Restrictive Covenants in such other respective jurisdictions.&nbsp;

In the event of a breach or attempted breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants
 in addition to any and all legal and equitable remedies immediately available
 such Restrictive Covenants may be enforced by a temporary and/or permanent injunction to secure the specific performance of such Restrictive Covenants
 and to prevent a breach or contemplated breach of such Restrictive Covenants
 without the need to post any bond or other security of any kind. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants would be inadequate. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and are intended to be and are in addition to any other remedies available to the Company
 either at law or in equity. In addition
 Employee agrees that
 in the event of a breach of the Restrictive Covenants by Employee as determined pursuant to a final
 non-appealable decision by a court of competent jurisdiction
 he shall be liable
 and shall reimburse the Company
 for all fees
 costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and other professional fees) arising out of or in any way related to the enforcement of such Restrictive Covenants. The Company agrees that in the event of a dispute or breach in which Employee prevails pursuant to a final
 non-appealable decision by a court of competent jurisdiction
 the Company shall be liable
 and shall reimburse Employee
 for all fees
 costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and other professional fees) arising out of or in any way related to the enforcement of the Restrictive Covenants.&nbsp;

Any payments provided for in this Agreement shall be paid net of any applicable income tax withholding required under federal
 state or local law.&nbsp;

This Agreement shall be interpreted to avoid any penalty sanctions under Section&#160;409A of the Code. If any payment or benefit cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions under Section&#160;409A
 then such benefit or payment shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter when such sanctions will not be imposed. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement will be made upon a &#8220;separation from service&#8221; under Section&#160;409A of the Code. For purposes of Section&#160;409A of the Code
 each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. In no event may Employee
 directly or indirectly
 designate the calendar year of payment. To the maximum extent permitted under Section&#160;409A of the Code and its corresponding regulations
 the cash severance benefits payable under this Agreement are intended to meet the requirements of the short-term deferral exemption under Section&#160;409A of the Code and the &#8220;separation pay exception&#8221; under Treas. Reg. &#167;1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii). However
 if such severance benefits do not qualify for such exemptions at the time of Employee&#8217;s termination of employment and therefore are deemed as deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Section&#160;409A of the Code
 then if Employee is a &#8220;specified employee&#8221; under Section&#160;409A of the Code on the date of Employee&#8217;s termination of employment
 notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
 payment of severance under this Agreement shall be delayed for a period of six (6)&#160;months from the date of Employee&#8217;s termination of employment if required by Section&#160;409A of the Code. The accumulated postponed amount shall be paid in a lump sum payment within ten (10)&#160;days after the end of the six (6)&#160;month period. If Employee dies during the postponement period prior to payment of the postponed amount
 the amounts withheld on account of Section&#160;409A of the Code shall be paid to Employee&#8217;s estate within sixty (60) days after the date of Employee&#8217;s death. &nbsp;





 including
 where applicable
 the requirement that (i)&#160;any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during Employee&#8217;s lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement)
 (ii)&#160;the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement
 or in kind benefits provided
 during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement
 or in kind benefits to be provided
 in any other calendar year
 (iii)&#160;the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred and (iv)&#160;the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

 shall be made without regard to whether such payments and benefits
 either alone or in conjunction with any other payments or benefits made available to Employee by the Company and its affiliates
provided
 however
 that if the Total After-Tax Payments (as defined below) would be increased by limitation or elimination of payments or benefits provided under 
 then the amounts and benefits payable under 
&#8221; means the total of all &#8220;parachute payments&#8221; (as that term is defined in Section&#160;280G(b)(2) of the Code) made to or for the benefit of Employee (whether made under this Agreement or otherwise)
 after reduction for all applicable taxes (including
 without limitation
 the Excise Tax). If a reduction to the payments or benefits provided under 
 such reduction shall be determined in the following order and priority: first
 there shall be reduced or eliminated any such right
 payment or benefit that is excluded from the coverage of Code Section 409A
 and then there shall be reduced or eliminated any such right
 payment or benefit that is subject to Code Section 409A (with the reduction in rights
 payments or benefits subject to Code Section 409A occurring in the reverse chronological order in which such rights
 payments or benefits would otherwise be or become vested
 exercisable or settled). For the avoidance of doubt
 the parties expressly agree that this Section 17(c) shall prevail over any inconsistent or conflicting terms in Section 14 of the Plan.&nbsp;

&#8221;) immediately prior to the Change of Control. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual
 entity or group effecting the Change of Control
 Employee may appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Employee
 except as described in the next paragraph.&nbsp;

As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&#160;280G and Section&#160;4999 of the Code at the time of the Change of Control
&#8221;)
 consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service
 or a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction
 that an Overpayment has been made
 any such Overpayment shall repaid to the Company by Employee within thirty (30)&#160;days of such determination
 with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section&#160;7872(f)(2). In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service
 or a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction
 any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section&#160;7872(f)(2) of the Code
 within thirty (30)&#160;days of such determination.&nbsp;

. If the Company reasonably requests that Employee take action to mitigate or challenge
 or to mitigate and challenge
 any such tax or assessment and Employee complies with such request
 the Company shall provide Employee with such information and such expert advice and assistance from the Company&#8217;s accountants
 lawyers and other advisors as Employee may reasonably request and shall pay for all expenses incurred in effecting such compliance and any related fines
 penalties
 interest and other assessments.&nbsp;






The failure of any party to enforce any provision or protections of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions as to any future violations thereof
 nor prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted the parties herein are cumulative and the waiver of any single remedy shall not constitute a waiver of such party's right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances.&nbsp;

This Agreement has been executed in
 and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
 the State of Michigan.&nbsp;

Any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
 or if that court does not have or will not accept jurisdiction
 in any court of general jurisdiction in Oakland County
 Michigan
 and Employee and the Company hereby consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such court(s) and hereby waive any objection(s) that they may have to personal jurisdiction
 the laying of venue of any such proceeding and any claim or defense of inconvenient forum.&nbsp;

The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions may be determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable
 in whole or in part
 the remaining provisions and any partially unenforceable provision to the extent enforceable in any jurisdiction nevertheless shall be binding and enforceable.&nbsp;

This Agreement
 inclusive of the above recitals
 sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of Employee and the Company with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements
 whether written or oral
 in respect thereof. For the avoidance of doubt
 the parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement replaces and supersedes that certain Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between the Company and Employee and that certain Amended and Restated Change in Control Agreement. No modification
 termination or attempted waiver of this Agreement shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the same is sought to be enforced.&nbsp;

The rights and obligations of Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
 and shall be binding on
 Company and its successors and assigns. This Agreement is personal to Employee and he may not assign his obligations under this Agreement in any manner whatsoever and any purported assignment shall be void. The Company
 however
 may assign this Agreement in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of its equity interests or assets.&nbsp;

The parties acknowledge that each of them has equally participated in the final wording of this Agreement. Accordingly
 the parties agree that this Agreement shall be construed equally against each party and shall not be more harshly construed against a party by reason of the fact that a particular party's counsel may have prepared this Agreement.&nbsp;



This Agreement may be executed
 including execution by electronic signature
 in one or more counterparts
 each of which shall be deemed an original
 and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.&nbsp;



Employee agrees that Employee will be subject to any compensation clawback or recoupment policies that may be applicable to Employee as an executive of the Company
 as in effect from time to time and as approved by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof
 whether or not approved before or after the effective date of this Agreement.&nbsp;

 of this Agreement will survive and not be affected by (i) the termination or expiration of this Agreement
 (ii) the termination of Employee&#8217;s employment or (iii) the execution of the Release.&nbsp;

 Payment of the Option Price for Shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option may be made all or in part through the tender to the Company of Shares
 which shall be valued
 for purposes of determining the extent to which the Option Price has been paid thereby
 at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise or surrender.&nbsp;

 method of settlement
 form of consideration payable in settlement
 method by or forms in which Shares will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants
 whether or not an SAR shall be in tandem or in combination with any other Award
 and any other terms and conditions of any SAR.&nbsp;

 Unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement or any amendment or modification thereof
 no SAR may be sold
 transferred
 pledged
 assigned
 or otherwise alienated or hypothecated
 otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further
 all SARs granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant. Any attempt to transfer a SAR in violation of this Plan shall render such SAR null and void.&nbsp;

 a Participant may vest in more than 100% of the number of Restricted Share Units awarded to the Participant.&nbsp;

. Subject to Section 3.6
 at the time an Award of Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units is made
 the Committee may
 in its sole discretion
&#8221;) applicable to such Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units
 during which a portion of the Shares related to such Award shall become nonforfeitable or vest
 on each anniversary of the Grant Date or otherwise
 as the Committee may deem appropriate. Each Award of Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units may be subject to a different Restricted Period. The Committee may
 in its sole discretion
 at the time a grant of Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units is made
 prescribe restrictions in addition to or other than the expiration of the Restricted Period
 including the satisfaction of corporate or individual performance conditions
. Neither Restricted Shares nor Restricted Share Units may be sold
 transferred
 assigned
 pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period or prior to the satisfaction of any other restrictions prescribed by the Committee with respect to such Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units. Each Participant may designate a beneficiary upon his or her death for the Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units awarded to him or her under the Plan. If a Participant fails to designate a beneficiary
 the Participant shall be deemed to have designated his or her estate as his or her beneficiary. Any attempt to transfer an Award of Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units in violation of this Plan shall render such Award null and void.&nbsp;

. The Company shall issue
 in the name of each Participant to whom Restricted Shares have been granted
 Share certificates representing the total number of Restricted Shares granted to the Participant
 as soon as reasonably practicable after the Grant Date. The Committee may provide in an Award Agreement that either (i)&#160;the Company shall hold such certificates for the Participant&#8217;s benefit until such time as the Restricted Shares are forfeited to the Company or the restrictions lapse
 or (ii)&#160;such certificates shall be delivered to the Participant

 however
 that such certificates shall bear a legend or legends that comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and makes appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed under the Plan and the Award Agreement.&nbsp;

. Unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement
 holders of Restricted Shares shall have the right to vote such Shares and the right to receive any dividends or distributions declared or paid with respect to such Shares. All distributions
 if any
 received by a Participant with respect to Restricted Shares as a result of any share split
 share dividend
 combination of shares
 or other similar transaction shall be subject to the restrictions applicable to the original Award. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in cash
 unless otherwise specified in the Award Agreement
 the right to receive such cash payments shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability as the Restricted Shares with respect to which they are paid
 and shall be accumulated during the Restricted Period and paid or forfeited when the Restricted Shares vest or are forfeited. In no event shall any cash dividend or distribution be paid later than 2&#189; months after the end of the tax year in which the applicable Restricted Period ends.&nbsp;






 Unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement
 holders of Restricted Share Units shall have no rights as shareholders of the Company including the right to direct the voting of the subject Shares underlying a Restricted Share Unit Award. A holder of a Restricted Share Units shall not have the right to receive Dividend Equivalent Rights to the extent such Restricted Share Units are not vested. &nbsp;

. A holder of Restricted Share Units shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. Restricted Share Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company
 subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement.&nbsp;

. Unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement or in a written agreement with the Participant after the Award Agreement is issued
 upon the termination of a Participant&#8217;s Service
 any Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units held by such Participant that have not vested
 or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not lapsed
 shall immediately be deemed forfeited
 except to the extent that such termination is due to death
 Disability
 or Retirement. Further
 the Award Agreement may specify that the vested portion of the Award shall continue to be subject to the terms of any applicable transfer or other restriction. Unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement or in a written agreement with the Participant after the Award Agreement is issued
 if a Participant&#8217;s Service is terminated due to (i) death or Disability
 any outstanding Award of Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units shall be fully vested
 below; or (ii) due to Retirement
 any outstanding Award of Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units shall be forfeited
 subject to the Committee&#8217;s discretion to accelerate all or part of such Award
 below; provided
 however
 in the case of any Award relating to Restricted Share Units
 the Shares subject to such Award shall be delivered in accordance with their original vesting schedule. Upon forfeiture of any Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units
 a Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Award
 including but not limited to any right to vote Restricted Shares or any right to receive dividends with respect to Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units.&nbsp;

Delivery of Shares. Except as otherwise specified in an Award Agreement with respect to a particular Award of Restricted Shares or unless the Company shall then have uncertificated Shares
 within thirty (30)&#160;days of the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period
 a certificate or certificates representing all Shares relating to such Award which have not been forfeited shall be delivered to the Participant or to the Participant&#8217;s beneficiary or estate
 as the case may be. Except as otherwise specified with respect to a particular Award of Restricted Share Units or unless the Company shall then have uncertificated Shares
 within thirty (30)&#160;days of the satisfaction of the vesting criterion applicable to such Award
 a certificate or certificates representing all Shares relating to such Award which have vested shall be issued or transferred to the Participant.&nbsp;




 in its sole discretion
&#8221;) under the Plan. Unrestricted Share Awards may be granted or sold as described in the preceding sentence in respect of past services and other valid consideration
 or in lieu of
 or in addition to
 any cash compensation due to such Participant.



. A Dividend Equivalent Right is an Award entitling the recipient to receive credits based on cash distributions that would have been paid on the Shares specified in the Dividend Equivalent Right (or other Award to which it relates) if such Shares had been issued to and held by the recipient. A Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any Participant
 provided that any Award of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall comply with
 or be exempt from
 Code Section&#160;409A. Dividend Equivalent Rights may not be granted hereunder relating to Shares which are subject to Options or Share Appreciation Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan
 no dividend or Dividend Equivalent Right shall provide for any crediting or payment on any Award or portion of an Award that is not vested. The terms and conditions of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be specified in the Award. Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or Shares or a combination thereof
 in a single installment or installments
 all determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled upon exercise
 settlement
 or payment of
 or lapse of restrictions on
 such other Award
 unless such settlement would cause an Award that is otherwise exempt from Code Section&#160;409A to become subject to and not in compliance with Code Section&#160;409A (e.g.
 in the case of a Non-Qualified Option). Such Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire or be forfeited or annulled under the same conditions as such other Award. A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may also contain terms and conditions different from such other Award.&nbsp;




. Except as may otherwise be provided by the Committee either in the Award Agreement or in a written agreement with the Participant after the Award Agreement is issued
 a Participant&#8217;s rights in all Dividend Equivalent Rights shall automatically terminate upon the Participant&#8217;s termination of Service for any reason.&nbsp;



. The right of a Participant to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of any Performance Award
 and the timing thereof
 may be subject to such corporate or individual performance conditions as may be specified by the Committee. The Committee may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions
 and may exercise its discretion to reduce the amounts payable under any Award subject to performance conditions.&nbsp;

 If and to the extent that the Committee determines to grant a Performance Award to a Participant
 the grant
 exercise and/or settlement of such Performance Award may be contingent upon achievement of pre-established performance goals and other terms set forth in this 

. The performance goals for such Performance Awards may consist of one or more business criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of such criteria
. Performance goals may be objective and may require that the level or levels of performance targeted by the Committee result in the achievement of performance goals that are &#8220;substantially uncertain.&#8221; The Committee may determine that such Performance Awards shall be granted
 exercised and/or settled upon achievement of any one performance goal or that two or more of the performance goals must be achieved as a condition to grant
 exercise and/or settlement of such Performance Awards. Performance goals may differ for Performance Awards granted to any one Participant or to different Participants.&nbsp;

. One or more of the business criteria for the Company
 on a consolidated basis
 and/or specified Subsidiaries or business units of the Company or the Company (except with respect to the total shareholder return and earnings per share criteria)
 may be used by the Committee in establishing performance goals for such Performance Awards
 including without limitation: (1)&#160;total shareholder return (share price appreciation plus dividends)
 (2)&#160;net income
 (3)&#160;earnings per share
 (4)&#160;return on equity
 (5)&#160;return on assets
 (6)&#160;return on invested capital
 (7)&#160;increase in the market price of Shares or other securities
 (8)&#160;revenues
 (9)&#160;net operating income
 (10)&#160;operating margin (operating income divided by revenues)
 (11)&#160;earnings before interest
 taxes
 depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or adjusted EBITDA
 (12)&#160;the performance of the Company in any one or more of the items mentioned in clauses&#160;(1) through (11)&#160;in comparison to the average performance of the companies used in a self-constructed peer group for measuring performance under an Award
 or (13)&#160;the performance of the Company in any one or more of the items mentioned in clauses&#160;(1) through (11)&#160;in comparison to a budget or target for measuring performance under an Award. Business criteria may be measured on an absolute basis or on a relative basis (i.e.
 performance relative to peer companies) and on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis.&nbsp;

Performance goals shall be established
 in writing
 not later than 90&#160;days or such later time after the beginning of any performance period applicable to such Performance Awards.&nbsp;

 Settlement of such Performance Awards shall be in cash
 Shares
 other Awards or other property
 in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee may
 in its discretion
 reduce the amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in connection with such Performance Awards. The Committee shall specify in the Award Agreement the circumstances in which such Performance Awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of termination of Service by the Participant prior to the end of a performance period or settlement of Performance Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement
 if a Participant&#8217;s service is terminated (i) for any reason other than death
 Disability or Retirement
 any unvested and unearned portion of such Award shall be immediately forfeited; (ii) due to a Participant&#8217;s death or Disability
 the Award shall be fully vested and settled at the end of the applicable performance period based on and if required by the Committee in its discretion following
 certification by the Committee regarding the achievement of the performance goals applicable to such Award; and (iii) due to a Participant&#8217;s Retirement
 any unvested and unearned portion of such Award shall be immediately forfeited subject to the Committee&#8217;s discretion to accelerate the vesting of such Award based on the actual achievement of any applicable performance goals.&nbsp;

 All determinations as to the establishment of performance goals
 the amount of any Performance Award pool or potential individual Performance Awards and as to the achievement of performance goals relating to Performance Awards shall be made by the Committee.&nbsp;




 Notwithstanding anything to the foregoing
 the right to receive dividends
 Dividend Equivalent Rights or distributions with respect to a Performance Award shall only be granted to a Participant if and to the extent that the underlying Award is vested and earned by the Participant.&nbsp;

 or benefits to or for the Participant under this Plan
 all Other Agreements
 and all Benefit Arrangements
&#8221;) and&#160;(ii)&#160;if
 as a result of receiving a Parachute Payment
 the aggregate after-tax amounts received by the Participant from the Company under this Plan
 all Other Agreements
 and all Benefit Arrangements would be less than the maximum after-tax amount that could be received by the Participant without causing any such payment or benefit to be considered a Parachute Payment. In the event that the receipt of any such right to exercise
 vesting
 payment
 or benefit under this Plan
 in conjunction with all other rights
 payments
 or benefits to or for the Participant under any Other Agreement or any Benefit Arrangement would cause the Participant to be considered to have received a Parachute Payment under this Plan that would have the effect of decreasing the after-tax amount received by the Participant as described in clause&#160;(ii) of the preceding sentence those rights
 payments
 or benefits under this Plan
 any Other Agreements
 and any Benefit Arrangements that are to be reduced or eliminated so as to avoid having the payment or benefit to the Participant under this Plan be deemed to be a Parachute Payment shall be determined in the following order and priority: first
 there shall be reduced or eliminated any such right
 payment or benefit that is excluded from the coverage of Code Section&#160;409A
 and then there shall be reduced or eliminated any right
 payment or benefit that is subject to Code Section 409A (with the reduction in rights
 payments or benefits subject to Code Section 409A occurring in the reverse chronological order in which such rights
 payments or benefits would otherwise be or become vested
 exercisable or settled).



. The Company shall not be required to sell
 deliver or cause to be issued any Shares under any Award if the sale or issuance of such Shares would constitute a violation by the Participant
 any other individual exercising an Option or receiving the benefit of an Award
 or the Company of any provision of any law or regulation of any governmental authority
 including without limitation any federal or state securities laws or regulations. If at any time the Company shall determine
 in its discretion
 that the listing
 registration or qualification of any Shares subject to an Award upon any securities exchange or under any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of
 or in connection with
 the issuance or purchase of shares hereunder
 no Shares may be issued or sold to the Participant or any other individual exercising an Option pursuant to such Award unless such listing
 registration
 qualification
 consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company
 and any delay caused thereby shall in no way affect the date of termination of the Award. Any determination in this connection by the Company shall be final
 binding
 and conclusive. The Company may
 but shall in no event be obligated to
 cause to be registered any securities covered hereby pursuant to the Securities Act. The Company shall not be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the exercise of an Option or the issuance of Shares pursuant to the Plan to comply with any law or regulation of any governmental authority.&nbsp;

. During any time when the Company has a class of equity security registered under Section&#160;12 of the Exchange Act
 it is the intent of the Company that Awards pursuant to the Plan and the exercise of Options granted hereunder will qualify for the exemption provided by Rule&#160;16b-3 under the Exchange Act. To the extent that any provision of the Plan or action by the Committee does not comply with the requirements of Rule&#160;16b-3
 it shall be deemed inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. In the event that Rule&#160;16b-3 is revised or replaced
 the Board may exercise its discretion to modify this Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of
 or to take advantage of any features of
 the revised exemption or its replacement.&nbsp;






. If the number of outstanding Shares is increased or decreased or the Shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company on account of any recapitalization
 reclassification
 share split
 reverse split
 combination of shares
 exchange of shares
 share dividend or other distribution payable in capital stock
 or other increase or decrease in such Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company
 occurring after the Effective Date
 the number and kinds of Shares for which grants of Options and other Awards may be made under the Plan shall be adjusted proportionately and accordingly by the Company. In addition
 the number and kind of Shares for which Awards are outstanding shall be adjusted proportionately and accordingly so that the proportionate interest of the Participant immediately following such event shall
 to the extent practicable
 be the same as immediately before such event. Any such adjustment in outstanding Options or SARs shall not change the aggregate Option Price or SAR Exercise Price payable with respect to Shares that are subject to the unexercised portion of an outstanding Option or SAR
 as applicable

 however
 that all adjustments shall be made in compliance with Code Section&#160;409A or Code Section 422
 as applicable. The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as an increase in Shares effected without receipt of consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 in the event of any distribution to the Company&#8217;s shareholders of securities of any other entity or other assets (including an extraordinary cash dividend but excluding a non-extraordinary dividend payable in cash or in shares of the Company) without receipt of consideration by the Company
 the Company may
 in such manner as the Company deems appropriate
 adjust (i)&#160;the number and kind of Shares subject to outstanding Awards and/or (ii)&#160;the exercise price of outstanding Options and Share Appreciation Rights to reflect such distribution.&nbsp;



&#160;hereof
 if the Company shall be the surviving entity in any Reorganization
 any then outstanding Option or SAR shall pertain to and apply to the securities to which a holder of the number of Shares subject to such Option or SAR would have been entitled immediately following such Reorganization
 with a corresponding proportionate adjustment of the Option Price or SAR Exercise Price per share so that the aggregate Option Price or SAR Exercise Price thereafter shall be the same as the aggregate Option Price or SAR Exercise Price of the Shares remaining subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to such Reorganization; provided
 however
 that all adjustments shall be made in compliance with Code Section 409A. Subject to any contrary language in an Award Agreement
 any restrictions applicable to such Award shall apply as well to any replacement securities received by the Participant as a result of the Reorganization. In the event of a Reorganization described in the preceding sentence
 any outstanding Restricted Share Units shall be adjusted so as to apply to the securities that a holder of the number of Shares subject to the Restricted Share Units would have been entitled to receive immediately following such transaction; provided
 however
 that all adjustments shall be made in compliance with Code Section 409A.&nbsp;

&#160;hereof
 if the Company shall not be the surviving entity in the event of any Reorganization
 the Committee in its discretion may provide for the assumption or continuation of any outstanding Options
 SARs
 Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units
 or for the substitution for such Options
 SARs
 Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units of new options
 share appreciation rights
 restricted shares and restricted shares units relating to the shares of stock of a successor entity
 or a parent or subsidiary thereof
 with appropriate adjustments as to the number of shares (disregarding any consideration that is not common shares) and option and share appreciation right exercise prices
 in which event the outstanding Options
 SARs
 Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units shall continue in the manner and under the terms (assumption or substitution) so provided. Appropriate adjustments shall be made in compliance with Code Section 409A
 including the provisions of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) regarding substitutions and assumptions of stock rights by reason of a corporate transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 in the event such successor entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof) refuses to assume or substitute Awards as provided above
 pursuant to a Reorganization described in this 
 such nonassumed or nonsubstituted Awards shall have their vesting accelerate as to all shares subject to such Award
 with any Performance Awards being deemed to have vested at their target levels.&nbsp;






 Subject to the provisions of Section 16.3.2 below and except as otherwise provided for in an Award Agreement
 in the event of a Change in Control in which the successor/acquirer company does not issue Alternative Awards (as defined below) within the meaning of Section 16.3.2
 all outstanding Awards shall&#160;immediately become vested
 with any Performance Awards being deemed to have vested at their target levels. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 16.3
 the treatment of any 409A Award in connection with a Change in Control shall be governed by Section 17 and the requirements of Code Section 409A.&nbsp;


 no cancellation
 acceleration of exercisability
 vesting
 cash settlement or other payment shall occur with respect to any Option
 Share Appreciation Right
 Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit if the Committee reasonably determines in good faith prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control that such Award shall be honored or assumed
 or new rights substituted therefor (such honored
&#8221;)
 by a Participant&#8217;s employer (or the parent or an affiliate of such employer) immediately following the Change in Control; provided that any such Alternative Award must:&nbsp;



Provide such Participant with rights and entitlements substantially equivalent to or better than the rights
 terms and conditions applicable under such award
 including
 but not limited to
 an identical or better exercise or vesting schedule and identical or better timing and methods of payment;&nbsp;



Have terms and conditions which provide that in the event that a Participant&#8217;s Service is involuntarily terminated by the successor employer without Cause or by a Participant for Good Reason
 in either case within the one-year period following the Change in Control
 all of such Participant&#8217;s Option and/or SARs shall be deemed immediately and fully exercisable
 the Restricted Period shall lapse as to each of such Participant&#8217;s outstanding Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit Awards
 and each such Alternative Award shall be settled for a payment per each share of stock subject to the Alternative Award in cash
 in immediately transferable
 publicly traded securities or in a combination thereof
 in an amount equal to
 in the case of an Option or SAR
 the excess of the Fair Market Value of such stock on the date of the Participant&#8217;s termination of Service over the corresponding exercise or base price per share and
 in the case of any Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Unit award
 the Fair Market Value of the number of shares of Common Stock subject or related thereto; and&nbsp;

Solely with respect to any Performance Awards
 be converted into restricted share awards at the target levels
 with any new &#8220;restricted period&#8221; based on the remaining performance period previously applicable to such Performance Awards.&nbsp;


 the provisions of this Section 16.3 may not be amended in any respect for two years following a Change in Control.&nbsp;

 related to Shares or other securities of the Company shall be made by the Committee
 whose determination in that respect shall be final
 binding and conclusive. No fractional Shares or other securities shall be issued pursuant to any such adjustment
 and any fractions resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated in each case by rounding down to the nearest whole Share. The Committee shall determine the effect of a Change in Control upon Awards other than Options
 SARs
 Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units and such effect shall be set forth in the appropriate Award Agreement. The Committee may provide in the Award Agreements at the Grant Date
 or any time thereafter with the consent of the Participant
 for different provisions to apply to an Award in place of those described in Sections&#160;
 

. The making of Awards pursuant to the Plan shall not affect or limit in any way the right or power of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate to make adjustments
 reclassifications
 reorganizations
 or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge
 consolidate
 dissolve
 or liquidate
 or to sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.&nbsp;






. This Plan and any Award granted hereunder is intended to comply with
 or be exempt from
 the provisions of Code Section 409A
 and shall be interpreted and administered in a manner consistent with that intention.&nbsp;

 shall apply to any 409A Award or any portion an Award that is or becomes subject to Code Section 409A
 notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Plan or the Award Agreement applicable to such Award. 409A Awards include
 without limitation:&nbsp;



Any other Award that either (i) provides by its terms for settlement of all or any portion of the Award on one or more dates following the Short-Term Deferral Period (as defined below)
 or (ii) permits or requires the Participant to elect one or more dates on which the Award will be settled.&nbsp;


&#8221; means the period ending on the later of (i) the date that is 2 &#189;&nbsp;months from the end of the Company&#8217;s fiscal year in which the applicable portion of the Award is no longer subject to a &#8220;substantial risk of forfeiture&#8221;
 or (ii) the date that is 2 &#189;&nbsp;months from the end of the Participant&#8217;s taxable year in which the applicable portion of the Award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For this purpose
 the term &#8220;

. Except as otherwise permitted or required by Section 409A or any applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Code Section 409A or other applicable guidance
 the following rules shall apply to any deferral and/or payment elections (each
 an &#8220;

All Elections must be in writing and specify the amount of the payment in settlement of an Award being deferred
 as well as the time and form of payment as permitted by this Plan;&nbsp;

All Elections shall be made by the end of the Participant&#8217;s taxable year prior to the year in which services commence for which an Award may be granted to such Participant; provided
 however
 that if the Award qualifies as &#8220;performance-based compensation&#8221; for purposes of Code Section 409A and is based on services performed over a period of at least twelve (12) months
 then the Election may be made no later than six (6) months prior to the end of such period; and&nbsp;

Elections shall continue in effect until a written election to revoke or change such Election is received by the Company
 except that a written election to revoke or change such Election must be made prior to the last day for making an Election determined in accordance with 






 














A specified time (or pursuant to a fixed schedule) that is either (i) specified by the Committee upon the grant of an Award and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award
 or (ii) specified by the Participant in an Election complying with the requirements of 
 as applicable;&nbsp;

To the extent provided by Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Code Section 409A or other applicable guidance
 a change in the ownership or effective control or the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company; or&nbsp;




&#8221; (as determined in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A)
 in settlement of a 409A Award may be made before the date which is six (6) months after such Participant&#8217;s date of Separation from Service
 or
 if earlier
 the date of the Participant's death.

. The Committee shall have the authority to provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any 409A Award for payment in settlement of all or a portion of such Award in the event that a Participant establishes
 to the satisfaction of the Committee
 the occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency (as defined in Code Section 409A). In such event
 the amount(s) distributed with respect to such Unforeseeable Emergency cannot exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of such payment(s)
 after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise
 by cancellation of any deferral election previously made by the Participant or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). All payments with respect to an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be made in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the Committee&#8217;s determination that an Unforeseeable Emergency has occurred. The occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be judged and determined by the Committee. The Committee&#8217;s decision with respect to whether an Unforeseeable Emergency has occurred and the manner in which
 if at all
 the payment in settlement of an Award shall be altered or modified
 shall be final
 conclusive
 and not subject to approval or appeal.&nbsp;

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
 this Plan does not permit the acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment under this Plan in settlement of a 409A Award
 except as permitted by Code Section 409A and/or Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Code Section 409A or other applicable guidance.&nbsp;



. No provision in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement shall be construed to confer upon any individual the right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate
 or to interfere in any way with any contractual or other right or authority of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate either to increase or decrease the compensation or other payments to any individual at any time
 or to terminate any employment or other relationship between any individual and the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate. In addition
 notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary
 unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement
 no Award granted under the Plan shall be affected by any change of duties or position of the Participant
 so long as such Participant continues to be a Director
 officer
 consultant or employee of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate. The obligation of the Company to pay any benefits pursuant to this Plan shall be interpreted as a contractual obligation to pay only those amounts described herein
 in the manner and under the conditions prescribed herein. The Plan shall in no way be interpreted to require the Company to transfer any amounts to a third party or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any Participant or beneficiary under the terms of the Plan.&nbsp;




. Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the submission of the Plan to the Company&#8217;s shareholders for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations upon the right and authority of the Board to adopt such other incentive compensation arrangements (which arrangements may be applicable either generally to a class or classes of individuals or specifically to a particular individual or particular individuals) as the Board in its discretion determines desirable
 including
 without limitation
 the granting of options otherwise than under the Plan.&nbsp;

. The Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate
 as the case may be
 shall have the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to a Participant (or require a Participant to pay) any federal
 state
 or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the vesting of or other lapse of restrictions applicable to an Award or upon the issuance of any Shares upon the exercise of an Option or pursuant to an Award. At the time of such vesting
 lapse
 or exercise
 the Participant shall pay to the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate
 as the case may be
 to satisfy the applicable withholding obligation
 or the Company may elect to
 or may cause a Subsidiary or Affiliate to withhold Shares otherwise issuable to the Participant in satisfaction of a Participant&#8217;s withholding obligations not to exceed the statutory maximum withholding rate. The Participant may elect to satisfy such obligations
 in whole or in part
3&#160;to deliver Shares may satisfy his/her withholding obligation only with Shares that are not subject to any repurchase
 forfeiture
 unfulfilled vesting
 or other similar requirements.&nbsp;



Each Award granted under the Plan may contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Committee
 in its sole discretion.&nbsp;

. With respect to words used in this Plan
 the singular form shall include the plural form
 the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender
 etc.
 as the context requires.&nbsp;

 If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction
 the remaining provisions hereof and thereof shall be severable and enforceable in accordance with their terms
 and all provisions shall remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction.&nbsp;

 one for each and every political subdivision of each country
 state
 province and county
 as applicable in the world. If any court determines that any Restrictive Covenant
 or any portion thereof
 is invalid or unenforceable
 the remainder of the Restrictive Covenants shall not be affected and shall be given full force and effect
 without regard to the invalid covenant or the invalid portion. If any court determines that any Restrictive Covenant
 or any portion of any such covenant
 is unenforceable because of its duration or geographic scope
 such court shall have the power to reduce such duration or scope
 as the case may be
 and enforce such covenant or portion in such reduced form. The parties intend to and hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the courts of any jurisdiction in which Employee is alleged to have committed an act in violation of any of the covenants contained here. If the courts of any one or more of such jurisdictions hold the Restrictive Covenants
 or any portion thereof
 unenforceable
 it is the intention of the parties that such determination not bar or in any way affect the right of the Company to the relief provided above in the courts of any other jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such Restrictive Covenants as to breaches of such Restrictive Covenants in such other respective jurisdictions.&nbsp;

In the event of a breach or attempted breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants
 in addition to any and all legal and equitable remedies immediately available
 such Restrictive Covenants may be enforced by a temporary and/or permanent injunction to secure the specific performance of such Restrictive Covenants
 and to prevent a breach or contemplated breach of such Restrictive Covenants
 without the need to post any bond or other security of any kind. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants would be inadequate. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and are intended to be and are in addition to any other remedies available to the Company
 either at law or in equity. In addition
 Employee agrees that
 in the event of a breach of the Restrictive Covenants by Employee as determined pursuant to a final
 non-appealable decision by a court of competent jurisdiction
 he shall be liable
 and shall reimburse the Company
 for all fees
 costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and other professional fees) arising out of or in any way related to the enforcement of such Restrictive Covenants. &nbsp;

Any payments provided for in this Agreement shall be paid net of any applicable income tax withholding required under federal
 state or local law.&nbsp;




This Agreement shall be interpreted to avoid any penalty sanctions under Section&#160;409A of the Code. If any payment or benefit cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions under Section&#160;409A
 then such benefit or payment shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter when such sanctions will not be imposed. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement will be made upon a &#8220;separation from service&#8221; under Section&#160;409A of the Code. For purposes of Section&#160;409A of the Code
 each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. In no event may Employee
 directly or indirectly
 designate the calendar year of payment. To the maximum extent permitted under Section&#160;409A of the Code and its corresponding regulations
 the cash severance benefits payable under this Agreement are intended to meet the requirements of the short-term deferral exemption under Section&#160;409A of the Code and the &#8220;separation pay exception&#8221; under Treas. Reg. &#167;1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii). However
 if such severance benefits do not qualify for such exemptions at the time of Employee&#8217;s termination of employment and therefore are deemed as deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Section&#160;409A of the Code
 then if Employee is a &#8220;specified employee&#8221; under Section&#160;409A of the Code on the date of Employee&#8217;s termination of employment
 notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
 payment of severance under this Agreement shall be delayed for a period of six (6)&#160;months from the date of Employee&#8217;s termination of employment if required by Section&#160;409A of the Code. The accumulated postponed amount shall be paid in a lump sum payment within ten (10)&#160;days after the end of the six (6)&#160;month period. If Employee dies during the postponement period prior to payment of the postponed amount
 the amounts withheld on account of Section&#160;409A of the Code shall be paid to Employee&#8217;s estate within sixty (60) days after the date of Employee&#8217;s death. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section&#160;409A of the Code
 including
 where applicable
 the requirement that (i)&#160;any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during Employee&#8217;s lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement)
 (ii)&#160;the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement
 or in kind benefits provided
 during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement
 or in kind benefits to be provided
 in any other calendar year
 (iii)&#160;the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred and (iv)&#160;the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.&nbsp;

 shall be made without regard to whether such payments and benefits
 either alone or in conjunction with any other payments or benefits made available to Employee by the Company and its affiliates
provided
 however
 that if the Total After-Tax Payments (as defined below) would be increased by limitation or elimination of payments or benefits provided under 
 then the amounts and benefits payable under 
&#8221; means the total of all &#8220;parachute payments&#8221; (as that term is defined in Section&#160;280G(b)(2) of the Code) made to or for the benefit of Employee (whether made under this Agreement or otherwise)
 after reduction for all applicable taxes (including
 without limitation
 the Excise Tax). If a reduction to the payments or benefits provided under 
 such reduction shall be determined in the following order and priority: first
 there shall be reduced or eliminated any such right
 payment or benefit that is excluded from the coverage of Code Section 409A
 and then there shall be reduced or eliminated any such right
 payment or benefit that is subject to Code Section 409A (with the reduction in rights
 payments or benefits subject to Code Section 409A occurring in the reverse chronological order in which such rights
 payments or benefits would otherwise be or become vested
 exercisable or settled). For the avoidance of doubt
 the parties expressly agree that this Section 17(c) shall prevail over any inconsistent or conflicting terms in Section 13 of the Plan.&nbsp;

&#8221;) immediately prior to the Change of Control. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual
 entity or group effecting the Change of Control
 Employee may appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Employee
 except as described in the next paragraph.&nbsp;




As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&#160;280G and Section&#160;4999 of the Code at the time of the Change of Control
&#8221;)
 consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service
 or a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction
 that an Overpayment has been made
 any such Overpayment shall repaid to the Company by Employee within thirty (30)&#160;days of such determination
 with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section&#160;7872(f)(2). In the event that there is a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service
 or a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction
 any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Employee together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section&#160;7872(f)(2) of the Code
 within thirty (30)&#160;days of such determination.&nbsp;

. If the Company reasonably requests that Employee take action to mitigate or challenge
 or to mitigate and challenge
 any such tax or assessment and Employee complies with such request
 the Company shall provide Employee with such information and such expert advice and assistance from the Company&#8217;s accountants
 lawyers and other advisors as Employee may reasonably request and shall pay for all expenses incurred in effecting such compliance and any related fines
 penalties
 interest and other assessments.&nbsp;



The failure of any party to enforce any provision or protections of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions as to any future violations thereof
 nor prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted the parties herein are cumulative and the waiver of any single remedy shall not constitute a waiver of such party's right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances.&nbsp;

This Agreement has been executed in
 and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
 the State of Michigan.&nbsp;

Any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
 or if that court does not have or will not accept jurisdiction
 in any court of general jurisdiction in Oakland County
 Michigan
 and Employee and the Company hereby consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such court(s) and hereby waive any objection(s) that they may have to personal jurisdiction
 the laying of venue of any such proceeding and any claim or defense of inconvenient forum.&nbsp;

The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions may be determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable
 in whole or in part
 the remaining provisions and any partially unenforceable provision to the extent enforceable in any jurisdiction nevertheless shall be binding and enforceable.&nbsp;

This Agreement
 inclusive of the above recitals
 sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of Employee and the Company with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements
 whether written or oral
 in respect thereof. For the avoidance of doubt
 the parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement replaces and supersedes that certain Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between the Company and Employee and that certain Amended and Restated Change in Control Agreement. No modification
 termination or attempted waiver of this Agreement shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the same is sought to be enforced.&nbsp;

The rights and obligations of Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
 and shall be binding on
 Company and its successors and assigns. This Agreement is personal to Employee and he may not assign his obligations under this Agreement in any manner whatsoever and any purported assignment shall be void. The Company
 however
 may assign this Agreement in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of its equity interests or assets.&nbsp;

The parties acknowledge that each of them has equally participated in the final wording of this Agreement. Accordingly
 the parties agree that this Agreement shall be construed equally against each party and shall not be more harshly construed against a party by reason of the fact that a particular party's counsel may have prepared this Agreement.&nbsp;






This Agreement may be executed
 including execution by electronic signature
 in one or more counterparts
 each of which shall be deemed an original
 and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.&nbsp;



Employee agrees that Employee will be subject to any compensation clawback or recoupment policies that may be applicable to Employee as an executive of the Company
 as in effect from time to time and as approved by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof
 whether or not approved before or after the effective date of this Agreement.&nbsp;

 of this Agreement will survive and not be affected by (i) the termination or expiration of this Agreement
 (ii) the termination of Employee&#8217;s employment or (iii) the execution of the Release.&nbsp;

 and respecting the dignity due everyone. 


 reflecting all aspects of good citizenship. 






 satisfied
 and appreciated. We respect cultural diversity and recognize that the various communities in which we may do business may have different legal provisions pertaining to the workplace. As such
 we will adhere to the limitations specified by law in all of our localities
 and further
 we will not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind -- especially involving race
 color
 religion
 gender
 age
 national origin
 disability
 and veteran or marital status. 


 integrity
 respect
 trust
 responsibility
 and citizenship permits us the opportunity to achieve excellence in our workplace. While everyone who works for the Company must contribute to the creation and maintenance of such an environment
 our executives and management personnel assume special responsibility for fostering a work environment that is free from the fear of retribution and will bring out the best in all of us. Supervisors must be careful in words and conduct to avoid placing
 or seeming to place
 pressure on subordinates that could cause them to deviate from acceptable ethical behavior. 

Protect Yourself
 Your Fellow Employees
 and the World We Live In


 safe
 and healthy work environment
 and to observe environmentally sound business practices. We will strive
 at a minimum
 to do no harm and where possible
 to make the communities in which we work a better place to live. Each of us is responsible for compliance with environmental
 health
 and safety laws and regulations. Observe posted warnings and regulations. Report immediately to the appropriate management any accident or injury sustained on the job
 or any environmental or safety concern you may have. 








 it is a minimum
 absolutely essential condition for performance of our duties. In conducting business
 we shall:




 directors and employees must strictly adhere to all antitrust laws. Such laws exist in the United States
 the European Union
 and in many other countries where the Company may conduct business. These laws prohibit practices in restraint of trade such as price fixing and boycotting suppliers or customers. They also bar pricing intended to run a competitor out of business; disparaging
 misrepresenting
 or harassing a competitor; stealing trade secrets; bribery; and kickbacks. 







 we must always be alert to and comply with the security laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. 




 directors and employees
 directly or indirectly through their families or others
 from purchasing or selling company stock while in the possession of material
 non-public information concerning the Company. This same prohibition applies to trading in the stock of other publicly held companies on the basis of material
 non-public information. To avoid even the appearance of impropriety
 Company policy also prohibits officers
 directors and employees from trading options on the open market in Company stock under any circumstances.


 non-public information is any information that could reasonably be expected to affect the price of a stock. If an officer
 director or employee is considering buying or selling a stock because of inside information they possess
 they should assume that such information is material. It is also important for the officer
 director or employee to keep in mind that if any trade they make becomes the subject of an investigation by the government
 the trade will be viewed after-the-fact with the benefit of hindsight. Consequently
 officers
 directors and employees should always carefully consider how their trades would look from this perspective.








 Zivo Bioscience must be fair and accurate in all reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers
 directors and management of Zivo Bioscience are responsible for ensuring that all reports are filed in a timely manner and that they fairly present the financial condition and operating results of the Company. 








 directors and employees have an obligation to give their complete loyalty to the best interests of the Company. They should avoid any action that may involve
 or may appear to involve
 a conflict of interest with the company. Officers
 directors and employees should not have any financial or other business relationships with suppliers
 customers or competitors that might impair
 or even appear to impair
 the independence of any judgment they may need to make on behalf of the Company. 



Employment by a competitor
 or potential competitor
 regardless of the nature of the employment
 while employed by Zivo Bioscience. &nbsp;

Acceptance of gifts

 or services from those seeking to do business with Zivo Bioscience. &nbsp;

Placement of business with a firm owned or controlled by an officer
 director or employee or his/her family. &nbsp;

Ownership of
 or substantial interest in
 a company that is a competitor
 client or supplier.&nbsp;

Acting as a consultant to a Zivo Bioscience customer
 client or supplier.&nbsp;







 directors and employees are under a continuing obligation to disclose any situation that presents the possibility of a conflict or disparity of interest between the officer
 director or employee and the Company. Disclosure of any potential conflict is the key to remaining in full compliance with this policy.

 or given in exchange for the furnishing or receipt of business courtesies. Officers
 directors and employees of Zivo Bioscience will neither give nor accept business courtesies that constitute
 or could be reasonably perceived as constituting
 unfair business inducements or that would violate law
 regulation or policies of the Company
 or could cause embarrassment to or reflect negatively on the Company&#8217;s reputation. 

Maintain the Integrity of Consultants
 Agents
 and Representatives


 representatives
 or consultants must certify their willingness to comply with the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures and must never be retained to circumvent our values and principles. Paying bribes or kickbacks
 engaging in industrial espionage
 obtaining the proprietary data of a third party without authority
 or gaining inside information or influence are just a few examples of what could give us an unfair competitive advantage and could result in violations of law. 




 suppliers
 customers
 and competitors may sometimes divulge to you information that is proprietary to their business. Respect these confidences. 




 information resources
 material
 facilities
 and equipment is your responsibility. Use and maintain these assets with the utmost care and respect
 guarding against waste and abuse
 and never borrow or remove Company property without management's permission.

 and at their own expense. In the United States
 federal law prohibits corporations from donating corporate funds

 and similar laws exist in other countries.

 the Company had a working capital deficiency of $8
338
483 and a stockholders&amp;#146; deficiency of $8

483 at December 31
 2019. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would
 therefore
 have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore
 there can be no assurance that any such required funds
 if available
 will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company&amp;#146;s existing shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset- carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;The Company is attempting to address its lack of liquidity by raising additional funds
 either in the form of debt or equity or some combination thereof. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise the additional funds it requires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;During the year ended December 31

 which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements and reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates
 actual results could differ from those estimates. Management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may
 as warranted
 solicit external professional advice and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cash and Cash Equivalents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;For the purpose of the statements of cash flows
 cash equivalents include time deposits
 certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents balances at financial institutions and are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250
000. At times
 balances in certain bank accounts may exceed the FDIC insured limits. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. At December 31
 2019
 the Company did not have any cash equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Property and Equipment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;Property and equipment consist of furniture and office equipment and are carried at cost less allowances for depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are determined by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend the economic life of an existing fixed asset are expensed as incurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debt Issuance Costs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;The Company follows authoritative guidance for accounting for financing costs (as amended) as it relates to convertible debt issuance cost. These costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt period or until redemption of the convertible debentures. Debt Issuance Costs are reported on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related notes. Amortization of debt issuance costs amounted to $1
187
817 and $5
093
001 and are included in Interest Expense and Interest Expense &amp;#150;&amp;#160;Related Parties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. Unamortized Debt Issuance Costs in the amounts of $-0- and $1
187
817 are netted against Convertible Notes Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in these financial statements as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revenue Recognition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;We will recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of product ownership have transferred to our customers
 as evidenced by the existence of an agreement
 delivery having occurred
 pricing being deemed fixed
 and collection being considered probable. We will record pricing allowances
 including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers
 when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;For year ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had no revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shipping and Handling Costs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 no shipping and handling costs were incurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research and Development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The majority of the Company&amp;#146;s research and development costs consist of clinical study expenses. These consist of fees
 charges
 and related expenses incurred in the conduct of clinical studies conducted with Company products by independent outside contractors. External clinical studies expenses were $2
307
033 and $2
814
991 for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Income Taxes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;The Company follows the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31
 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards. Since the Company has a history of losses
 and it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized
 a full valuation allowance has been established. In addition
 utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards is subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the &amp;#147;change in ownership&amp;#148; provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carry-forwards before utilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;We have adjusted Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities in accordance with the December 22
 2017 enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (See Note 11 &amp;#150;&amp;#160;Income Taxes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stock Based Compensation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718
 &lt;i&gt;Compensation &amp;#150;&amp;#160;Stock Compensation. &lt;/i&gt;Under the provisions of FASB ASC 718
 stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award&amp;#146;s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Company
 from time to time
 issues common stock or grants common stock options and warrants to its employees
 consultants and board members. At the date of grant
 the Company determines the fair value of the stock option award and recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period. Issuances of common stock are valued at the closing market price on the date of issuance and the fair value of any stock option or warrant awards is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;During 2019 and 2018
 options and warrants were granted to employees
 directors and consultants of the Company. As a result of these grants
 the Company recorded compensation expense of $3
605
235 and $1
393

 option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions

 in management&amp;#146;s opinion the existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Income (Loss) Per Share&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the Company&amp;#146;s net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period presented.

 which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities

 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards. Since the Company has a history of losses
 and it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized
 a full valuation allowance has been established. In addition
 utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards is subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the &amp;#147;change in ownership&amp;#148; provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carry-forwards before utilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;We have adjusted Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities in accordance with the December 22


 &lt;i&gt;Compensation &amp;#150;&amp;#160;Stock Compensation. &lt;/i&gt;Under the provisions of FASB ASC 718
 stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award&amp;#146;s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Company
 from time to time
 issues common stock or grants common stock options and warrants to its employees
 consultants and board members. At the date of grant
 the Company determines the fair value of the stock option award and recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period. Issuances of common stock are valued at the closing market price on the date of issuance and the fair value of any stock option or warrant awards is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;During 2019 and 2018

In accordance with ASC 470-20
 the Company valued the beneficial conversion feature and recorded the amount of $613

 the Company received funding of $1
250
000 through seven (7) individual loans (the &amp;#147;New Lenders&amp;#148;). Each loan included a (i) a Loan Agreement of the individual loan

000) and October 2018 ($650
000). Paulson received a 10% cash finance fee for monies invested in the Company in the form of convertible debt
 along with 5 year
 $.10 warrants equal to 15% of the number of common shares for which the debt is convertible into at $.10 per share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;On September 24

 one of the New Lenders bought the note of another New Lender. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;The New Lenders Notes are convertible into the Company&amp;#146;s restricted common stock at $.10 per share and bear interest at the rate of 11% per annum. The Company is in discussions through intermediaries with the remaining three (3) New Lenders to determine their intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;The New Lenders Notes must be repaid as follows: accrued interest must be paid on the first and second anniversary of the Note and unpaid principal not previously converted into common stock must be repaid on the second anniversary of the Note. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company has not made the required annual interest payments to five (5) New Lenders and is in default. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;On January 15

362
246 shares of the Company&amp;#146;s common stock (at $.10 per share) (see Note 12 &amp;#150;&amp;nbsp;Subsequent Events). As the Company has not received notices of default

 we do not currently consider ourselves in default to the three (3) remaining investors. Were the Company to be considered in default
 additional interest would accrue at a rate of 16% per annum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Debt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;In September 2014
 the Lender of the 1% convertible debentures agreed to rolling 30-day extensions until notice is given to the Company to the contrary. As of December 31

 100% of Mr. Dahl&amp;#146;s unvested options will be fully. Mr. Dahl&amp;#146;s Employment Agreement also provides for severance payments of

 2019
 the milestone relating to the identification of bioactive agents in the Company product and the filing of a patent with respect thereto was met
 thereby triggering the option to purchase 1
000
000 common shares. As per the Agreement
 the Company issued a non-qualified option to purchase 1 million shares of the Company according to the 2019 Incentive Plan at an exercise price of $.14 with a term of 10 years (these options were valued at $138
806 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following assumptions: volatility 164.37%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 1.84%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;The Company issued a non-qualified option to purchase 28 million shares of the Company according to the 2019 Incentive Plan at an exercise price of $.10 with a term of 10 years (these options were valued at $2

 2018 the Company entered into a one-year agreement with an Investment Banking
 Merger and Acquisition (M&amp;amp;A) and Corporate Advisory firm (&amp;#147;Firm&amp;#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement
 the Company issued a warrant to purchase 2
326
504 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.10 for a term of five years. The warrants were valued at $245
040 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following assumptions: volatility 177.09%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.69%. In addition to the contract fee
 the Company could potentially be obligated to pay up to an 8% M&amp;amp;A transaction fee (as defined in the Agreement) plus a warrant to purchase shares of common stock equal to between 0.5% and 1.0%. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company issued warrants to purchase 3
007
132 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.13 with a term of 5 years to an investment banker. The warrants were valued at $374
511 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following assumptions: volatility 180.13%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.65%. As a result of this issuance
 any further potential obligation to pay a M&amp;amp;A transaction fee relating to warrants to purchase shares of common stock would be equal to 0.5% of the post financing fully shares outstanding at an exercise price equal to the valuation / share price of the financing (see Note 8 &amp;#150;&amp;#160;Stockholders&amp;#146; Deficiency).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;On September 30
 2019
 effective July 9
 2019
 the Company entered into an agreement with a Financial Advisor. The Financial Advisor has been engaged in an exclusive arrangement in connection with the proposed securities offering and sale of up to $35 million of the Company&amp;#146;s Common Stock. The Company has agreed to pay the Financial Advisor
 upon the acceptance of a successful funding transaction
 a fee of 1% of the aggregate value of the transaction and a warrant to purchase up to 6
000
000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.10 for a term of five years. As of December 31
 2019
 in connection with this agreement
 no successful funding transactions have taken place and no warrants have been issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supply Chain Consulting Agreement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;On February 27
 2019
 the Company entered into a Supply Chain Consulting Agreement with a consultant (&amp;#147;Consultant&amp;#148;) (see Note 8 &amp;#150;&amp;nbsp;Stockholders&amp;#146; Deficiency). In May 2019
 the Company issued a supplemental warrant to purchase 5
000
000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.08 for a term of five years to the Consultant. The warrants were valued at $529
023 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following assumptions: volatility 181.49%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.34%. In October 2019
 2
000
000 of those warrants were returned to the Company resulting in a reduction in the value of $211
609. On September 14
 2019
 the parties entered into a First Amendment to the Supply Chain Consulting Agreement (&amp;#147;Supply Consulting Agreement Amendment&amp;#148;). The Supply Consulting Agreement Amendment provides that the Consultant will identify and help negotiate the terms of potential joint ventures involving algae production development projects or related transactions or business combinations (&amp;#147;Development Project&amp;#148;). The Supply Consulting Agreement provides for exclusivity in Southeast Asia; Oceania; Indian subcontinent; and Africa; with regions in the Middle East by mutual agreement. The closing of a Development Project (as acceptable to the Company) is defined as the date that the Company is able
 financially and otherwise
 to proceed with engineering and construction of algae production facilities
 processing or warehousing facilities and supply chain development
 or related business combinations rendering an equivalent outcome (in the reasonable determination of the Company)
 for the production
 processing
 transport
 compliance
 marketing and resale of its proprietary algae biomass. Upon the closing of a Development Project
 the Company will pay cash fees of $300
000 to Consultant
 pay an on-going monthly fee of $50
000 for 24 months and issue to Consultant a cashless warrant with a five-year term to purchase nineteen million (19
000
000) shares of the Company&amp;#146;s common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share. As of December 31
 2019
 the Development Project has not closed
 and the warrants have not yet been issued. The Board of Directors has also authorized the Company to issue to Consultant a cashless warrant with a five-year term to purchase 1
000
000 shares of the Company&amp;#146;s common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share at its discretion. As of December 31
 2019
 such warrant has not been issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legal Contingencies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;We may become a party to litigation in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management
 there are no legal matters involving us that would have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition

 2018 the Company had available net-operating loss carry-forwards for Federal tax purposes of approximately $76
746
000
 which may be applied against future taxable income
 if any
 at various dates from 2019 through 2039. Certain significant changes in ownership of the Company may restrict the future utilization of these tax loss carry-forwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot; style=&apos;margin:0&apos;&gt;At December 31
 2019 the Company had a deferred tax asset of approximately $20
721
000 representing the benefit of its net operating loss carry-forwards. The Company has not recognized the tax benefit because realization of the tax benefit is uncertain and thus a valuation allowance has been fully provided against the deferred tax asset. The difference between the Federal and State Statutory Rate of 27% and the Company&amp;#146;s effective tax rate of 0% is due to an increase in the valuation allowance of approximately $3

 the main potential effect is the uncertainty of the Company&amp;#146;s ability to raising capital. &amp;nbsp;Based on the nature of our operations
 employees are able to work remotely with access to teleconferencing and video conferencing. &amp;nbsp;The research partners utilized by the Company are currently providing services as requested
 although some University researchers have limited availability as their campuses have closed down
 with the expectation they will reopen sometime in April 2020. &amp;nbsp;However
 the Company cannot make any assurances the research partners will open as expected and perform at the levels as required until the COVID-19 situation is resolved. Other contract research organizations have remained open and accessible

In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09)
&#148; ASU 2014-09 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in &#147;Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)
&#148; and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflect the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases
 to require lessees to recognize all leases
 with limited exceptions
 on the balance sheet
 while recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to current lease accounting. The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting. Subsequently
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10
 Codification Improvements to Topic 842
 ASU No. 2018-11
 Targeted Improvements
 and ASU No. 2018-20
 Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors
The Company has adopted both of the ASUs on January 1
 2019. Prior comparative periods were not required to be restated and the ASUs have not had an impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.

The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
 which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements and reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates
 actual results could differ from those estimates. Management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may
 as warranted
 solicit external professional advice and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718
Under the provisions of FASB ASC 718
 stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award&#146;s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Company
 from time to time
 issues common stock or grants common stock options and warrants to its employees
 consultants and board members. At the date of grant
During 2019 and 2018
 options and warrants were granted to employees
 directors and consultants of the Company. As a result of these grants
 the Company recorded compensation expense of $3
605
235 and $1
393
313 during the years ended December 31
Year Ended December 31
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition
 option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions
 including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company&#146;s employee options and warrants have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate
 in management&#146;s opinion the existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the warrants.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31
 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards. Since the Company has a history of losses
