Our
brands

We
market the premium and super premium brands listed below.

Goslings
. We are the exclusive global distributor (other than in Bermuda) for Goslings rums
 including Goslings
Black Seal Dark Rum
 Goslings Gold Seal Rum and Goslings Old Rum. The Gosling family produces these rums in Bermuda
 where Goslings
rums have been under continuous production and ownership by the Gosling family for over 200 years. We hold an 80.1% controlling
interest in Gosling-Castle Partners Inc.
 or GCP
 a global export venture between us and the Gosling family. GCP has the exclusive
long-term export and distribution rights for the Goslings rum products for all countries other than Bermuda. The Goslings rum
brands accounted for approximately 21% and 24% of our revenues for our 2018 and 2017 fiscal years
 respectively. We also are the
exclusive global distributor (other than in Bermuda and various regional markets) of Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer
 an essential
 rum cocktail and the Goslings Dark &lsquo;n
Stormy

Jefferson&rsquo;s
. We develop and market four premium
 very small batch bourbons: Jefferson&rsquo;s
 Jefferson&rsquo;s
Reserve
 Jefferson&rsquo;s Ocean Aged at Sea and Jefferson&rsquo;s Presidential Select. Each of these four distinct premium Kentucky
bourbons is blended in batches using select barrels of certain mash bills and ages to produce specific flavor profiles. We also
market Jefferson&rsquo;s Straight Rye Whiskey
 a premium whiskey distilled from 100% North American rye
 Jefferson&rsquo;s Chef&rsquo;s
Collaboration
 a blend of bourbon and rye
 Jefferson&rsquo;s The Manhattan: Barrel Finished Cocktail
 a ready-to-drink cocktail
Jefferson&rsquo;s Wine Finish Collection
 bourbons aged in wine barrels
 and Jefferson&rsquo;s Wood Experiment
 innovative wood-finished
bourbons.

Clontarf
. Our family of Clontarf Irish whiskeys currently represents a majority of our case sales of Irish whiskey.
Clontarf
 an accessible and smooth premium Irish whiskey
 is distilled using quality grains and pure Irish spring water. Clontarf
is then aged in bourbon barrels and mellowed through Irish oak charcoal. Clontarf is available in single malt and classic versions.




    
    



Knappogue
. We developed our Knappogue Castle Whiskey
 a single malt Irish whiskey
 to build on both the popularity
of single malt Scotch whisky and the growth in the Irish whiskey category. Knappogue Castle Whiskey is distilled in pot stills
using malted barley and is aged twelve years. We have introduced Knappogue Twin Wood
 the first Sherry Finished Knappogue Castle
Whiskey. The whiskey is matured for sixteen years in two types of wood resulting in a perfectly balanced single malt Irish whiskey
with a complex
 rich taste and a slightly sweet sherry finish. Knappogue Castle 1951 is a pure pot-still whiskey that was distilled
in 1951 and then aged for 36 years in sherry casks. The name comes from an Irish castle
 formerly owned by Mark Edwin Andrews
the originator of the brand and the father of Mark Andrews
 our chairman.

Brady&rsquo;s
. Brady&rsquo;s Irish Cream
 a high quality Irish cream
 is made in small batches using Irish whiskey
dairy fresh cream and natural flavors.

Boru
. Boru vodka
 a premium vodka produced in Ireland
 was developed in 1998 and is named after the legendary High King
of Ireland
 Brian Boru
 who united the Irish clans and drove foreign invaders out of Ireland. It is five-times distilled using
pure spring water for smoothness and filtered through ten feet of charcoal made from Irish oak for increased purity.

Celtic
. Celtic Honey is a premium brand of Irish liqueur that is a unique combination of Irish spirits
 cognac
and a taste of honey. Gaelic Heritage Corporation Limited
 an affiliate of one of our bottlers
 has the exclusive rights to produce
and supply us with Celtic Honey.

Pallini
. We have the exclusive U.S. distribution rights (excluding duty free sales) for Pallini Limoncello and its related
brand extensions. Pallini Limoncello is a premium lemon liqueur
 which is served ice cold
 on the rocks or as an ingredient in
a wide variety of drinks
 ranging from martinis to iced tea. It is also used in cooking
 particularly for pastries and cakes.
Pallini Limoncello is crafted from an authentic family recipe. It is made with Italy&rsquo;s finest Sfusato Amalfitano lemons
that are hand-selected for optimal freshness and flavor. There are two other flavor extensions of this Italian liqueur: Pallini
Peachcello
 made with white peaches
 and Pallini Raspicello
 made from a combination of raspberries and other berries.

Gozio
. We are the exclusive U.S. distributor for Gozio amaretto
 which is made from a secret recipe that combines selected
fruits from four continents.

Arran
In 2017
 we became the exclusive U.S. distributor for the Arran Scotch whiskeys. Arran
Scotch whiskeys are produced by Isle of Arran Distillers
 an independent distiller of premium quality Single Malt Scotch
whiskeys. Located in the village of Lochranza on the Isle of Arran
 the distillery opened in 1995 and is the only whisky
producer on the island. The Arran portfolio includes the classic 10 Years Old
 the new 18 Years Old as well as the official Robert
Burns whiskeys
 endorsed by the World Burns Federation
 and the limited edition Machrie Moor Scotch Whiskeys.

Our
strategy

Our
objective is to continue building Castle Brands into a profitable international spirits company
 with a distinctive portfolio
of premium and super premium spirits brands. To achieve this
 we continue to seek to:



    
    
focus
 We continue to focus our distribution efforts
 sales expertise and targeted
    marketing activities on our more profitable brands and markets;

    
    
grow
We believe that continued organic growth will enable us to achieve long-term profitability. We focus
    on brands that have profitable growth potential and staying power
 such as our rums
 whiskeys and ginger beer
 sales
    of which have grown substantially in recent years;

    
    
build
 We use our existing assets
 expertise and resources to build consumer awareness and market penetration
    for our brands;

    
    
leverage
 Our established distribution network in all 50 U.S. states enables us to promote our brands
    nationally and makes us an attractive strategic partner for smaller companies seeking U.S. distribution; and

    
    
selectively
 We intend to continue to introduce new brand extensions and
    expressions. For example
 we have leveraged our successful Jefferson&rsquo;s portfolio by introducing a number of brand extensions.
    Additionally
 we added the Arran Scotch whiskeys to our portfolio as agency brands. We continue to explore strategic
    relationships
 joint ventures and acquisitions to selectively expand our premium spirits portfolio. We expect that future
    acquisitions or agency relations
 if any
 would involve some combination of cash
 debt and the issuance of our stock.


Production
and supply

There
are several steps in the production and supply process for beverage alcohol products. First
 all of our spirits products are distilled.
This is a multi-stage process that converts basic ingredients
 such as grain
 sugar cane or agave
 into alcohol. Next
 the alcohol
is processed and/or aged in various ways depending on the requirements of the specific brand. For our vodka
 this processing is
designed to remove all other chemicals
 so that the resulting liquid will be odorless and colorless
 and have a smooth quality
with minimal harshness. Achieving a high level of purity involves a series of distillations and filtration processes.


    
    



For
our spirits brands
 rather than removing flavor
 various complex flavor profiles are achieved through one or more of the following
techniques: infusion of fruit
 addition of various flavoring substances
 and
 in the case of rums and whiskeys
 aging of the brands
in various types of casks for extended periods of time and the blending of several rums or whiskeys to achieve a unique flavor
profile for each brand. After the distillation
 purification and flavoring processes are completed
 the various liquids are bottled.
This involves several important stages
 including bottle and label design and procurement
 filling of the bottles and packaging
of the bottles in various configurations for shipment.

We
do not have significant investments in distillation
 bottling or other production facilities or equipment. Instead
 we have entered
into relationships with several companies to provide those services to us. We believe that these types of arrangements allow us
to avoid committing significant amounts of capital to fixed assets and permit us to have the flexibility to meet growing sales
levels by dealing with companies whose capacity significantly exceeds our current needs. These relationships vary on a brand-by-brand
basis as discussed below. As part of our ongoing cost-containment efforts
 we intend to continue to review each of our business
relationships to determine if we can increase the efficiency of our operations.

Goslings
rum and ginger beer

Goslings
rums have been produced by the Gosling family in Hamilton
 Bermuda for over 200 years and
 under our distribution arrangements
with Gosling&rsquo;s Export (Bermuda) Limited (&ldquo;Gosling&rsquo;s Export&rdquo;)
 they have retained the right to act as the
sole supplier to GCP with respect to our Goslings rum requirements. Goslings sources its rums in the Caribbean and transports
them to Bermuda where they are blended according to proprietary recipes. The rums are then sent to a plant
 owned and operated
by a third party
 in the United States
 where they are bottled
 packaged
 stored and shipped to our third-party warehouse. We
believe that Gosling&rsquo;s Export&rsquo;s blending and storage facilities in Bermuda will accommodate our projected supply needs
for the foreseeable future. We believe our third-party U.S. bottler has ample capacity to meet our projected bottling needs for
the foreseeable future. See &ldquo;Strategic brand-partner relationships.&rdquo;

Our
Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer is produced
 canned and/or bottled by third-party soft-drink bottlers and canners to Goslings&rsquo;
formula and requirements. We believe these bottlers and canners have ample capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the
foreseeable future.

Knappogue
Castle and Clontarf Irish whiskeys

In
2012
 we entered into two long-term supply agreements with Irish Distillers Limited (&ldquo;IDL&rdquo;)
 a subsidiary of Pernod
Ricard
 under which it has agreed to supply us with the aged single malt and grain whiskeys used in our Knappogue Castle whiskey
products and all of our Clontarf Irish whiskey products. The first supply agreement provides for the production of blended Irish
whiskeys for us until the contract is terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the agreement. IDL may terminate
the contract if it provides at least six years prior notice
 except for breach. Under this agreement
 we provide IDL with a forecast
of the estimated amount of liters of pure alcohol we require for the next four fiscal contract years and agree to purchase that
amount
 subject to certain annual adjustments. The second supply agreement provides for the production of single malt Irish whiskeys
for us until the contract is terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the agreement. IDL may terminate the contract
if it provides at least thirteen years prior notice
 except for breach. Under this agreement
 we provide IDL with a forecast of
the estimated amount of liters of pure alcohol we require for the next twelve fiscal contract years and agree to purchase that
amount
 subject to certain annual adjustments. We are not obligated to pay for any product not yet received. The whiskeys are
then sent to Terra Limited (&ldquo;Terra&rdquo;) in Baileyboro
 Ireland
 where they are bottled in bottles we designed and packaged
for shipment. We believe that Terra
 which also acts as bottler for certain of our Boru vodka and as producer and bottler of our
Brady&rsquo;s Irish Cream (and as bottler for Celtic Honey
 which is supplied to us by one of Terra&rsquo;s affiliates)
 has sufficient
bottling capacity to meet our current needs
 and both Terra and IDL have the capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the
foreseeable future.

Terra
provides intake
 storage
 sampling
 testing
 filtering
 filling
 capping and labeling of bottles
 case packing
 warehousing and
loading and inventory control for our Knappogue Castle and Clontarf Irish whiskeys at prices that are adjusted annually by mutual
agreement based on changes in raw materials and consumer price indexes increases up to 3.5% per annum. This agreement also provides
for maintenance of product specifications and minimum processing procedures
 including compliance with applicable food and alcohol
regulations and maintenance
 storage and stock control of all raw products and finished products delivered to Terra. Terra holds
all alcohol on its premises under its customs and excise bond. Our bottling and services agreement with Terra will expire on June
30
 2018. We expect to continue to operate under the terms of the expiring contract as we negotiate a new agreement with Terra.
We believe we could obtain alternative sources of bottling and services if we are unable to renew the existing Terra contract.

Jefferson&rsquo;s
whiskeys

Our
Jefferson&rsquo;s whiskey portfolio is bottled for us by Luxco
 Inc. (&ldquo;Luxco&rdquo;)
 in Cleveland
 OH
 from our stocks
of aged bourbon and rye. Bourbon has been in short supply in the U.S. in recent years
 and we continue to actively seek alternate
sourcing for future supply. We have acquired stocks of aged bourbon
 which we anticipate will supply our currently forecasted
needs for the Jefferson&rsquo;s brand
 although there is no assurance we can source adequate amounts of bourbon or rye
 if demand
is greater than expected
 at satisfactory prices.


    
    



We
are parties to a supply agreement with a bourbon distiller
 which provides for the production of newly distilled bourbon whiskey
through June 30
 2026. Under this agreement
 the distiller provides us with an agreed upon amount of original proof gallons of
newly distilled bourbon whiskey
 subject to certain annual adjustments. We are not obligated to pay the distiller for any product
not yet received. Also
 if the distiller has excess inventory in any year
 we have the right
 but not the obligation
 to purchase
such excess.


We
have entered into another supply agreement with a bourbon distiller
 which provided for the production of newly distilled bourbon
whiskey through December 31
 2018
 subject to automatic annual renewals. Under this agreement
 the distiller provides us with
an agreed upon amount of original proof gallons of newly distilled bourbon whiskey
 subject to certain annual adjustments. We
are not obligated to pay the distiller for any product not yet received.

Boru
vodka

We
have a supply agreement with a leading European producer of grain neutral spirits to provide us with the distilled alcohol used
in our Boru vodka. The supply agreement provides for the producer to produce natural spirit for us with specified levels of alcohol
content pursuant to specifications set forth in the agreement and at specified prices through its expiration in December 2018
in quantities designated by us. We believe that the producer has sufficient distilling capacity to meet our needs for Boru vodka
for the foreseeable future. In the event that we do not renew the production agreement
 we believe that we will be able to obtain
grain neutral spirits from another supplier.

The
five-times distilled alcohol is delivered from the producer to the bottling premises at Terra
 where it is filtered in several
proprietary ways
 and pure water is added to achieve the desired proof. Depending on the size of the bottle
 Boru vodka is then
either bottled at Terra or shipped in bulk to the U.S. and bottled at Luxco
 where we bottle certain sizes for the U.S. market.
We believe that both Terra and Luxco have sufficient bottling capacity to meet our current needs
 and both have the capacity to
meet our anticipated future supply needs. As described above
 our bottling and services agreement with Terra will expire on June
30
 2018. We expect to continue to operate under the terms of the expiring contract as we negotiate a new agreement with Terra.
We believe we could obtain alternative sources of bottling and services if we are unable to renew the existing Terra contract.

Brady&rsquo;s
Irish Cream

Brady&rsquo;s
Irish Cream is produced for us by Terra. Fresh cream is combined with Irish whiskey
 grain neutral spirits and various flavorings
to our specifications
 and then bottled by Terra in bottles designed for us. We believe that Terra has the capacity to meet our
foreseeable supply needs for this brand. As described above
 our bottling and services agreement with Terra will expire on June
30
 2018. We expect to continue to operate under the terms of the expiring contract as we negotiate a new agreement with Terra.
We believe we could obtain alternative sources of bottling and services if we are unable to renew the existing Terra contract.

Celtic
Honey liqueur

Gaelic
Heritage Corporation Limited
 an affiliate of Terra
 has a contractual right to act as the sole supplier to us of Celtic Honey.
Gaelic Heritage mixes the ingredients comprising Celtic Honey using a proprietary formula and then Terra bottles it for them in
bottles designed for us. We believe that the necessary ingredients are available to Gaelic Heritage in sufficient supply and that
Terra&rsquo;s bottling capacity is currently adequate to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future. See &ldquo;Strategic
brand-partner relationships.&rdquo;

Pallini
liqueurs

Pallini
SpA (&ldquo;Pallini&rdquo;)
 as successor in interest to I.L.A.R. S.p.A.
 an Italian company based in Rome and owned since 1875
by the Pallini family
 produces Pallini Limoncello
 Raspicello and Peachcello. Pallini bottles the liqueurs at its plant in Rome
and ships them to us under our long-term exclusive U.S. marketing and distribution agreement. We believe that Pallini has adequate
facilities to produce and bottle sufficient Limoncello
 Peachcello and Raspicello to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable
future. See &ldquo;Strategic brand-partner relationships.&rdquo;

Gozio
amaretto

We
are the exclusive U.S. distributor for Gozio amaretto. Gozio amaretto is produced by Distillerie Franciacorta
 a spirits company
founded in 1901 and owned by the Gozio family. The company is located in Franciacorta
 in the Italian Region of Lombardy. We believe
that Distillerie Franciacorta has sufficient capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future for this brand.



    
    






We
are the exclusive U.S. distributor for the Isle of Arran premium whisky portfolio
 produced by the Isle of Arran Distillers. The
Isle of Arran Distillers is an independent distiller of premium quality Single Malt Scotch whiskeys. Located in the village of
Lochranza on the Isle of Arran
 the distillery opened in 1995 and is the only whisky producer on the island. The Arran&rsquo;s
portfolio includes the classic 10 Years Old
 the new 18 Years Old as well as the official Robert Burns whiskeys
 endorsed by the
World Burns Federation
 and the Machrie Moor whiskeys. We believe that the Isle of Arran Distillers has sufficient capacity to
meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future for these brands.

Distribution
network

We
believe that the distribution network that we have developed with our sales team and our independent distributors and brokers
is one of our strengths. We currently have distribution and brokerage relationships with third-party distributors in all 50 U.S.
states
 as well as distribution arrangements in approximately 20 other countries.

U.S.
distribution

Background.
Importers of beverage alcohol in the U.S. must sell their products through a three-tier distribution system. Typically
an imported brand is first sold to a U.S. importer
 who then sells it to a network of distributors
 or wholesalers
 covering the
U.S.
 in either &ldquo;open&rdquo; states or &ldquo;control&rdquo; states. In the 33 open states
 the distributors are generally
large
 privately-held companies. In the 17 control states
 the states themselves function as the distributor
 and regulate suppliers
such as us. The distributors and wholesalers in turn sell to individual retailers
 such as liquor stores
 restaurants
 bars
 supermarkets
and other outlets licensed to sell beverage alcohol. In larger states such as New York
 more than one distributor may handle a
brand in separate geographical areas. In control states
 importers sell their products directly to state liquor authorities
 which
distribute the products and either operate retail outlets or license the retail sales function to private companies
 while maintaining
strict control over pricing and profit.

The
U.S. spirits industry has consolidated dramatically over the last ten years due to merger and acquisition activity. There are
currently at least twelve major spirits companies
 each of which own and operate their own importing businesses. All companies
including these large companies
 are required by law to sell their products through wholesale distributors in the U.S. The major
companies are exerting increasing influence over the regional distributors and as a result
 it has become more difficult for smaller
companies to get their products recognized by the distributors. We believe our established distribution network in all 50 states
allows us to overcome a significant barrier to entry in the U.S. beverage alcohol market and enhances our attractiveness as a
strategic partner for smaller companies lacking comparable distribution.

For
fiscal 2018
 our U.S. sales represented approximately 90% of our revenues
 and we expect them to remain relatively consistent
as a percentage of our total sales in the near future. See note 16 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Importation.
We currently hold the federal importer and wholesaler license required by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau
of the U.S. Treasury Department
 and the requisite state license in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Our
inventory is strategically maintained in large bonded warehouses and shipped nationally by an extensive network of licensed and
bonded carriers.

Wholesalers
 In the U.S.
 we are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or
 in the control states
 state-owned
agencies performing this function
 to sell our brands to retail outlets. As a result
 we depend on distributors for sales
 for
product placement and for retail store penetration. We currently have no distribution agreements or minimum sales requirements
with any of our U.S. alcohol distributors
 and they are under no obligation to place our products or market our brands. All of
the distributors also distribute our competitors&rsquo; products and brands. As a result
 we must foster and maintain our relationships
with our distributors. Through our internal sales team
 we have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors
in each state
 and our products are currently sold in the U.S. by approximately 80 wholesale distributors
 as well as by various
state beverage alcohol control agencies.

International
distribution

In
our foreign markets
 most countries permit sales directly from the brand owner to retail establishments
 including liquor stores
chain stores
 restaurants and pubs
 without requiring that sales go through a wholesaler tier. In our international markets
 we
rely primarily on established spirits distributors in much the same way as we do in the U.S. We have engaged an international
beverage alcohol broker to represent our brands in approximately twenty international markets. We use Terra and other bonded warehouses
and logistic providers to handle the billing
 inventory and shipping for us for some products in certain of our non-U.S. markets.

As
in the U.S.
 the beverage alcohol industry has undergone consolidation internationally
 with considerable realignment of brands
and brand ownership. The number of major spirits companies internationally has been reduced significantly due to mergers and brand
ownership consolidation. While there are still a substantial number of companies owning one or more brands
 most business is now
done by the twelve major companies
 each of which owns and operates its own distribution company that distributes in the major
international markets. These captive distribution companies focus primarily on the brands of the companies that own them.


    
    



Even
though we do not utilize the direct route to market in our international operations
 we do not believe that we are at a significant
disadvantage
 because the local importers/distributors typically have established relationships with the retail accounts and are
able to provide extensive customer service
 in store merchandising and on premise promotions. Also
 even though we must compensate
our wholesalers and distributors in each market in which we sell our brands
 we are
 as a result of using these distributors
still able to benefit from substantially lower infrastructure costs and centralized billing and collection.

Our
primary international markets are Ireland
 Great Britain
 Northern Ireland
 Germany
 Canada
 France
 Finland
 Norway
 Sweden
Denmark and the Duty Free markets. We also have sales in other countries in continental Europe
 Latin America
 the Caribbean and
Asia. For fiscal 2018
 non-U.S. sales represented approximately 9% of our revenues. See note 16 to our accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

Significant
customers



Southern Glazer&rsquo;s Wine and Spirits and related entities
 accounted for approximately 37% of our consolidated revenues for
each of fiscal 2018 and 2017.

Our
sales team

While
we currently expect more rapid growth in the U.S.
 our primary market
 international markets hold potential for future growth
and are part of our global strategy.


sales force of 24 people
 including five regional U.S. vice presidents who have significant industry experience with premium
beverage alcohol brands.

Our
sales personnel are engaged in the day-to-day management of our distributors
 which includes setting quotas
 coordinating promotional
plans for our brands
 maintaining adequate levels of stock
 brand education and training and sales calls with distributor personnel.
Our sales team also maintains relationships with key retail customers through independent sales calls. They also schedule promotional
events
 create local brand promotion plans
 host in-store tastings where permitted and provide wait staff and bartender training
and education for our brands.

Advertising
marketing and promotion

To
build our brands
 we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: our distributors
 the retail trade and the end
consumer. Advertising
 marketing and promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image of our brands in our efforts
to build substantial brand value. We believe our execution of disciplined and strategic branding and marketing campaigns will
continue to drive our future sales.

We
employ full-time
 in-house marketing
 sales and customer service personnel who work together with third party design and advertising
firms to maintain a high degree of focus on each of our product categories and build brand awareness through innovative marketing
activities. We use a range of marketing strategies and tactics to build brand equity and increase sales
 including consumer and
trade advertising
 price promotions
 point-of-sale materials
 event sponsorship
 in-store and on-premise promotions and public
relations
 as well as a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques
 including social media marketing
to support our brands.

Besides
traditional advertising
 we also employ three other marketing methods to support our brands: public relations
 event sponsorships
and tastings. Our significant U.S. public relations efforts have helped gain editorial coverage for our brands
 which increases
brand awareness. Event sponsorship is an economical way for us to have influential consumers taste our brands. We actively contribute
product to trend-setting events where our brand has exclusivity in the brand category. We also conduct hundreds of in-store and
on-premise promotions each year.

We
support our brand marketing efforts with an assortment of point-of-sale materials. The combination of trade and consumer programs
supported by attractive point-of-sale materials
 also establishes greater credibility for us with our distributors and retailers.

Strategic
brand-partner relationships

We
forge strategic relationships with emerging and established spirits brand owners seeking opportunities to increase their sales
beyond their home markets and achieve global growth. This ability is a key component of our growth strategy and one of our competitive
strengths. Our original relationship with the Boru vodka brand was as its exclusive U.S. distributor. To date
 we have also established
strategic relationships for Goslings rums
 Pallini liqueurs
 Celtic Honey liqueur
 the Arran Scotch Whiskeys
 and Gozio
amaretto
 as described below
 and we intend to seek to expand our brand portfolio through similar future arrangements.


    
    



Gosling-Castle
Partners Inc./Goslings rums and ginger beer

In
2005
 we entered into an exclusive national distribution agreement with Gosling&rsquo;s Export for the Goslings rum products.
We subsequently purchased a 60% controlling interest in GCP
 a strategic export venture with the Gosling family. In March 2017
we purchased an additional 20.1% interest in GCP
 which we refer to as the GCP Share Acquisition
 and
 accordingly
 we now own
80.1% of GCP. Pursuant to an export agreement entered into between Gosling&rsquo;s Export and GCP
 Gosling&rsquo;s Export assigned
to GCP all of Gosling&rsquo;s Export&rsquo;s interest in our distribution agreement with them. GCP holds the exclusive distribution
rights for Goslings rum products and Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer on a worldwide basis (other than in Bermuda). The export agreement
expires in April 2030
 with ten-year renewal terms thereafter
 subject to specific termination rights held by each party. Under
the export agreement
 in the event Gosling&rsquo;s Export decides to sell any or all of its trademarks (or other intellectual
property rights) relating to the Goslings&rsquo; products (other than Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer) during the term of the export
agreement
 GCP has a right of first refusal to purchase said trademark(s) (and intellectual property rights
 if applicable) at
the same price being offered by a bona fide third-party offerer. If GCP does not exercise its right of first refusal
 then we
have an identical right of first refusal. In the event Gosling&rsquo;s Export decides to sell any or all of its products (other
than Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer) and/or trademark(s) (other than Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer)
 whether sold to an affiliate
a third party
 GCP or us
 GCP is entitled to share in the proceeds of such sale
 according to a schedule specified in the export
agreement. Also
 in the event Gosling&rsquo;s Export should decide to sell Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer or trademarks relating
to Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer
 whether sold to an affiliate
 a third party
 GCP or us
 then
 Gosling&rsquo;s Export agrees to
share with GCP an amount equal to a certain percentage of the proceeds of any such sale as specified in the export agreement.
The Goslings
 through Gosling Brothers Limited
 have the right to act as the sole supplier to GCP for our Goslings rum requirements.
Polar Corp.
 the exclusive U.S. manufacturer of the ginger beer
 is authorized to purchase product from GCP to sell directly on
a non-exclusive basis to its existing customers that are grocery supermarket chains
 drug store chains or convenience store chains
located in New England and New York through direct store delivery or approved wholesalers
 and on a limited basis to sell to liquor
stores in New England that are its existing clients.

Pallini
SpA/Pallini liqueurs

We
have an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement with Pallini under which we distribute Pallini Limoncello
 Peachcello and
Raspicello liqueurs in the U.S. We began shipping these products in September 2005.

Our
agreement with Pallini expires on March 31
 2021
 subject to successive five-year renewals unless either party delivers a notice
of non-renewal six months prior to the end of the term. Under the agreement
 if minimum shipment targets are not achieved and
not cured
 Pallini has the right to terminate the agreement without payment of termination fees to us. However
 if such targets
are met
 we have the right under the agreement to receive certain termination payments and other payments upon the non-renewal
of the agreement
 certain terminations of the agreement or the sale of the brand. The exclusive territory under the agreement
is the 50 states of the U.S. and the District of Columbia.

Gozio
amaretto

In
November 2011
 we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Distillerie Franciacorta S.p.A. under which we are the
exclusive distributor of Gozio amaretto in the U.S. The agreement had an initial five-year term
 and has automatic five-year renewals
unless either party delivers a notice of non-renewal six months prior to the end of the term. During the term
 we have the right
to purchase Gozio amaretto at stipulated prices and Distillerie Franciacorta Spa must maintain certain standards for its products.
We are required to prepare periodic reports detailing the development of the brand&rsquo;s sales and prepare annual strategic
marketing and growth plans.




In
February 2017
 we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with the Isle of Arran Distillers under which we are the exclusive
distributors for The Arran Malt Single Malt Scotch Whiskeys
 the Robert Burns Single Malt Scotch Whisky and Blended Scotch
Whisky and the Machrie Moor whiskeys in the U.S. market. The agreement has an initial term expiring on March 31
 2022
 and has
automatic five-year renewals upon our achieving certain minimum purchase requirements. During the term
 we have the right to purchase
Isle of Arran
 Robert Burns and Machrie Moor products at stipulated prices and Isle of Arran must maintain certain standards for
its products. We are required to prepare periodic reports detailing the development of the brand&rsquo;s sales and prepare annual
strategic marketing and growth plans.

Intellectual
property

Trademarks
are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks
 which we own or use under license.
Our brands are protected by trademark registrations or are the subject of pending applications for trademark registration in the
U.S.
 the European Union and most other countries where we distribute
 or plan to distribute
 our brands. The trademarks may be
registered in the names of our subsidiaries and related companies. Generally
 the term of a trademark registration varies from
country to country
 and
 in the U.S.
 trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks
in additional markets as we expand our distribution territories.

We
have entered into distribution agreements for brands owned by third parties
 such as the Goslings rums
 the Pallini liqueurs
Isle of Arran whiskeys and Gozio amaretto. The Goslings brands
 Pallini liqueurs
 Isle of Arran and Robert Burns Scotch whiskeys
and Gozio amaretto are registered by their respective owners. Goslings also has a trademark for their signature rum cocktail
 Dark &lsquo;n Stormy.
See &ldquo;Strategic brand-partner relationships.&rdquo;


    
    





Our
industry is subject to seasonality with seasonal holiday buying typically generating peak retail sales in the fourth calendar
quarter (our third fiscal quarter). Historically
 this holiday demand typically resulted in slightly higher sales for us in our
third and/or fourth fiscal quarters.



The
beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We believe that we compete on the basis of quality
 price
 brand recognition
and distribution strength. Our premium brands compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases
retail shelf space
 restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors
of beverage alcohol products
 many of which have greater resources than us.

Over
the past ten years
 the U.S. spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership.
The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today there are at least thirteen major companies:
Diageo PLC
 Pernod Ricard S.A.
 Bacardi Limited
 Brown-Forman Corporation
 Beam Suntory Inc.
 Davide Campari Milano-S.p.A.
 Remy
Cointreau S.A.
 LVMH Mo&euml;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A
 Constellation Brands
 Inc.
 Proximo Spirits
 Sazerac Company
 Inc.
Heaven Hill Brands and William Grant &amp; Sons Distillers
 Ltd.

We
believe that we are sometimes in a better position to partner with small to mid-size brands than the major importers. Despite
our relative capital position and resources
 we have been able to compete with these larger companies in pursuing agency distribution
agreements and acquiring brands by being more responsive to private and family-owned brands
 offering flexible transaction structures
and providing brand owners the option to retain local production and &ldquo;home&rdquo; market sales. Given our size relative
to our major competitors
 most of which have multi-billion dollar operations
 we believe that we can provide greater focus on
smaller brands and tailor transaction structures based on individual brand owner preferences. However
 our relative capital position
and resources may limit our marketing capabilities
 limit our ability to expand into new markets and limit our negotiating ability
with our distributors.

By
focusing on the premium and super-premium segments of the market
 which typically have higher margins
 and having an established
experienced sales force
 we believe we are able to gain relatively significant attention from our distributors for a company of
our size. Our U.S. regional vice presidents provide long-standing relationships with distributor personnel and with their major
customers. Finally
 the continued consolidation among the major companies is expected to create an opportunity for small to mid-size
wine and spirits companies
 such as ourselves
 as the major companies contract their portfolios to focus on fewer brands.

Government
regulation

We
are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act
 U.S. Customs Laws
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 and
the Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws of all fifty states.

The
U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production
 blending
 bottling
 sales
and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also
 each state regulates the advertising
 promotion
 transportation
sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the U.S. only with
holders of licenses to import
 warehouse
 transport
 distribute and sell spirits.

In
Europe
 we are subject to similar regulations related to the production of spirits.

We
are subject to U.S. and European regulations on the advertising
 marketing and sale of beverage alcohol. These regulations range
from a complete prohibition of the marketing of alcohol in some countries to restrictions on the advertising style
 media and
messages used.

Labeling
of spirits is also regulated in many markets
 varying from health warning labels to importer identification
 alcohol strength
and other consumer information. All beverage alcohol products sold in the U.S. must include warning statements related to risks
of drinking beverage alcohol products.

We
are also subject to certain regulatory requirements regarding minimum aging of spirits.

In
the U.S. control states
 the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased
and offered for sale in their respective states. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which
are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Consumers may purchase products
not selected for listings only through special orders
 if at all.

The
distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation in the U.S. and internationally.
Most foreign countries in which we do business impose excise duties on distilled spirits
 although the form of such taxation varies
from a simple application on units of alcohol by volume to intricate systems based on the imported or wholesale value of the product.
Several countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits
 often discriminating between categories in the rate of such
tariffs. Import and excise duties may have a significant effect on our sales
 both through reducing the consumption of alcohol
and through encouraging consumer switching into lower-taxed categories of alcohol.


    
    



We
believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal
 state and other regulations. However
 we operate in a highly
regulated industry which may be subject to more stringent interpretations of existing regulations. Future compliance costs due
to regulatory changes could be significant.

Since
we import distilled spirits products produced primarily outside the U.S.
 adverse effects of regulatory changes are more likely
to materially affect earnings and our competitive market position rather than capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in our
industry are normally associated with either production facilities or brand acquisition costs. Because we are not a U.S. producer
changes in regulations affecting production facility operations may indirectly affect the costs of the brands we purchase for
resale
 but we would not anticipate any resulting material adverse impact upon our capital expenditures.

Global
conglomerates with international brands dominate our industry. The adoption of more restrictive marketing and sales regulations
or increased excise taxes and customs duties could materially adversely affect our earnings and competitive industry position.
Large international conglomerates have greater financial resources than we do and would be better able to absorb increased compliance
costs.



As
of March 31
 2018
 we had 57 employees
 32 of which were in sales and marketing and 25 of which were in management
 finance and
administration. As of March 31
 2018
 51 of our employees were located in the U.S. and six were located in Ireland.

Item
1A. Risk Factors

Risks
Relating To Our Business

We
have never been profitable
 and believe we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.


since our inception
 including a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $0.8 million for fiscal 2018
 and had
an accumulated loss of $149.9 million as of March 31
 2018. We believe that we will continue to incur consolidated net
losses as we expect to make continued significant investment in product development and sales and marketing and to incur significant
administrative expenses as we seek to grow our brands. We also anticipate that our cash needs will exceed our income from sales
for the near future. Some of our products may never achieve widespread market acceptance and may not generate sales and profits
to justify our investment. Also
 we may find that our expansion plans are more costly than we anticipate and that they do not
ultimately result in commensurate increases in our sales
 which would further increase our losses. We expect we will continue
to experience losses and negative cash flow from operations
 some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend
upon numerous factors
 some of which are beyond our control
 including market acceptance of our products
 new product introductions
and competition. We incur substantial operating expenses at the corporate level
 including costs directly related to being an
SEC reporting company.


    
    



Worldwide
and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions could adversely impact our financial performance.



subject to risks associated with worldwide and domestic economic conditions
 including economic slowdowns and the disruption
volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets.


economic conditions in the United States have improved since the economic downturn several years ago
 future economic deterioration
in the United States or worldwide could adversely impact our major suppliers
 distributors and retailers. The inability of suppliers
distributors or retailers to conduct business or to access liquidity could impact our ability to distribute our products.


There
can be no assurance that market conditions will not deteriorate in the near future. A prolonged downturn
 worsening or broadening
of the adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our
products
 and create or exacerbate credit issues
 cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers
distributors
 retailers and consumers. Depending upon their severity and duration
 these conditions could have a material adverse
impact on our business
 liquidity
 financial condition and results of operations.

We
may require additional capital
 which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms
 or at all. Our inability to raise such
capital
 as needed
 on beneficial terms or at all could restrict our future growth and severely limit our operations.

We
have limited capital compared to other companies in our industry. This may limit our operations and growth
 including our ability
to continue to develop existing brands
 service our debt obligations
 maintain adequate inventory levels
 fund potential acquisitions
of new brands
 penetrate new markets
 attract new customers and enter into new distribution relationships. If we have not generated
sufficient cash from operations to finance additional capital needs
 we will need to raise additional funds through private or
public equity and/or debt financing. We cannot assure you that
 if and when needed
 additional financing will be available to
us on acceptable terms or at all. If additional capital is needed and either unavailable or cost prohibitive
 our operations and
growth may be limited as we may need to change our business strategy to slow the rate of
 or eliminate
 our expansion or reduce
or curtail our operations. Also
 any additional financing we undertake could impose covenants upon us that restrict our operating
flexibility
 and
 if we issue equity securities to raise capital our existing shareholders may experience dilution and the new
securities may have rights
 preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.

If
our brands do not achieve more widespread consumer acceptance
 our growth may be limited.

Most
of our brands are early in their growth cycle and have not achieved extensive brand recognition. Also
 brands we may acquire in
the future are unlikely to have established extensive brand recognition. Accordingly
 if consumers do not accept our brands
 we
will not be able to penetrate our markets and our growth may be limited.

We
depend on a limited number of suppliers. Failure to obtain satisfactory performance from our suppliers or loss of our existing
suppliers could cause us to lose sales
 incur additional costs and lose credibility in the marketplace. We also have annual purchase
obligations with certain suppliers.

We
depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the sourcing of all of our products
 including both our own proprietary
brands and those we distribute for others. These suppliers consist of third-party distillers
 bottlers and producers in the U.S.
Bermuda
 the Caribbean and Europe. We rely on the owners of Goslings rum
 Pallini liqueurs
 Isle of Arran whiskeys
 and Gozio
amaretto to produce their brands for us. For our proprietary products
 we may rely on a single supplier to fulfill one or all
of the manufacturing functions for a brand. For instance
 IDL is the sole provider of our single malt
 blended and grain Irish
whiskeys. We do not have long-term written agreements with all of our suppliers. We do not currently have a long-term source for
supply of aged rye and there can be no assurance we can source adequate amounts of aged bourbon or rye at satisfactory prices
or at all. Also
 if we fail to complete purchases of products ordered annually
 certain suppliers have the right to bill us for
product not purchased during the period. The termination of our written or oral agreements or an adverse change in the terms of
these agreements could have a negative impact on our business. If our suppliers increase their prices
 we may not have alternative
sources of supply and may not be able to raise the prices of our products to cover all or even a portion of the increased costs.
Also
 our suppliers&rsquo; failure to perform satisfactorily or handle increased orders
 delays in shipments of products from
suppliers or the loss of our existing suppliers
 especially our key suppliers
 could cause us to fail to meet orders for our products
lose sales
 incur additional costs and/or expose us to product quality issues. In turn
 this could cause us to lose credibility
in the marketplace and damage our relationships with distributors
 ultimately leading to a decline in our business and results
of operations. If we are not able to renegotiate these contracts on acceptable terms or find suitable alternatives
 our business
could be negatively impacted.


    
    



We
depend on our independent wholesale distributors to distribute our products. The failure or inability of even a few of our distributors
to adequately distribute our products within their territories could harm our sales and result in a decline in our results of
operations.

We
are required by law to use state licensed distributors or
 in 17 states known as &ldquo;control states
&rdquo; state-owned agencies
performing this function
 to sell our products to retail outlets
 including liquor stores
 bars
 restaurants and national chains
in the U.S. We have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors in each state; however
 failure to maintain
those relationships could significantly and adversely affect our business
 sales and growth. Over the past decade there has been
increasing consolidation
 both intrastate and interstate
 among distributors. As a result
 many states now have only two or three
significant distributors. Also
 there are several distributors that now control distribution for several states. For the fiscal
year ended March 31
 2018
 sales to one distributor accounted for 37.2% of revenues. For the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
sales to this same distributor accounted for 36.6% of revenues. As a result
 if we fail to maintain good relations with a distributor
our products could in some instances be frozen out of one or more markets entirely. The ultimate success of our products also
depends in large part on our distributors&rsquo; ability and desire to distribute our products to our desired U.S. target markets
as we rely significantly on them for product placement and retail store penetration. We have no formal distribution agreements
or minimum sales requirements with any of our distributors and they are under no obligation to place our products or market our
brands. Moreover
 all of them also distribute competitive brands and product lines. We cannot assure you that our U.S. alcohol
distributors will continue to purchase our products
 commit sufficient time and resources to promote and market our brands and
product lines or that they can or will sell them to our desired or targeted markets. If they do not
 our sales will be harmed
resulting in a decline in our results of operations.

While
most of our international markets do not require the use of independent distributors by law
 we have chosen to conduct our sales
through distributors in all our markets and
 accordingly
 we face similar risks to those set forth above with respect to our international
distribution. Some of these international markets may have only a limited number of viable distributors.

We
must maintain a relatively large inventory of our products
 including aging bourbon
 to support customer delivery requirements
and if this inventory is lost due to theft
 fire or other damage or becomes obsolete
 our results of operations would be negatively
impacted.

We
must maintain relatively large inventories to meet customer delivery requirements for our products. In particular
 we must maintain
sufficient supplies of aging bourbon to support the Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbons. We are always at risk of loss of that inventory
due to theft
 fire or other damage
 and any such loss
 whether insured against or not
 could cause us to fail to meet our orders
and harm our sales and operating results. Also
 our inventory may become obsolete as we introduce new products
 cease to produce
old products or modify the design of our products&rsquo; packaging
 which would increase our operating losses and negatively impact
our results of operations.

If
we are unable to identify and successfully acquire additional brands that are complementary to our existing portfolio
 our growth
could be limited
 and
 even if additional brands are acquired
 we may not realize planned benefits due to integration difficulties
or other operating issues.

A
component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional brands that are complementary to our existing portfolio through
acquisitions of such brands or their corporate owners
 directly or through mergers
 joint ventures
 long-term exclusive distribution
arrangements and/or other strategic relationships. If we are unable to identify suitable brand candidates and successfully execute
our acquisition strategy
 our growth could be limited. Also
 even if we are successful in acquiring additional brands
 we may
not be able to achieve or maintain profitability levels that justify our investment in
 or realize operating and economic efficiencies
or other planned benefits with respect to
 those additional brands. The addition of new products or businesses entails numerous
risks with respect to integration and other operating issues
 any of which could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations
and/or the value of our equity. These risks include:



    
    
difficulties
    in assimilating acquired operations or products;

    
    
unanticipated
    costs that could materially adversely affect our results of operations;

    
    
negative
    effects on reported results of operations from acquisition related charges and amortization of acquired intangibles;

    
    
diversion
    of management&rsquo;s attention from other business concerns;

    
    
adverse
    effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 distributors and retail customers;

    
    
risks
    of entering new markets or markets in which we have limited prior experience; and

    
    
the
    potential inability to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses.


Also
there are special risks associated with the acquisition of additional brands through joint venture arrangements. We may not have
a majority interest in
 or control of
 future joint ventures in which we may enter. There is
 therefore
 risk that our joint venture
partners may at any time have economic
 business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals
or those of the joint venture. There is also risk that our current or future joint venture partners may be unable to meet their
economic or other obligations and that we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.

Our
ability to grow through the acquisition of additional brands will also be dependent upon the availability of capital to complete
the necessary acquisition arrangements. We intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash
resources
 third -party financing and
 in appropriate circumstances
 the further issuance of equity and/or debt securities; however
our ability to finance such acquisitions may be limited by the terms of our other equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring additional
brands could have a significant effect on our financial position
 and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and
yearly operating results. Also
 acquisitions could result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on our
financial statements
 the amortization or impairment of which would reduce reported earnings in subsequent years.


    
    



Currency
exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations may have a significant adverse effect on our revenues
 sales
 costs of goods and overall
financial results.

For
fiscal 2018
 non-U.S. operations accounted for approximately 10% of our revenues. Therefore
 gains and losses on the conversion
of foreign payments into U.S. dollars could cause fluctuations in our results of operations
 and fluctuating exchange rates could
cause reduced revenues and/or gross margins from non-U.S. dollar-denominated international sales and inventory purchases. Also
for fiscal 2018
 Euro denominated sales accounted for approximately 6% of our total revenue
 so a substantial change in the rate
of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the Euro could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. Our ability
to acquire spirits and produce and sell our products at favorable prices will also depend in part on the relative strength of
the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge against these risks.

We
have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
 and our business and stock price may be
adversely affected if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting.

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting
 as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended. As disclosed in Item 9A of this annual report
 management
identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the reconciliation of inventory
transfers between domestic and foreign locations. In the past
 management identified a material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting related to the allocation of excise taxes and freight costs to inventory. A material weakness is defined
as a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Because of this material weakness
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective based on criteria set forth by the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. If other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are
discovered or occur in the future
 it may result in untimely or inaccurate reporting of our financial condition or results of
operations. Ineffective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information
 which
could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock
 limit our ability to access the capital markets in the
future and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.

A
failure of one or more of our key information technology systems
 networks
 processes
 associated sites or service providers
including as a result of evolving cyber security and other technological risks
 could have a material adverse impact on our business.

We
rely on information technology (IT) systems
 networks
 and services
 including internet sites
 data hosting and processing facilities
and tools
 hardware (including laptops and mobile devices)
 software and technical applications and platforms
 some of which are
managed
 hosted
 provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors
 to assist us in the management of our business. The various
uses of these IT systems
 networks
 and services include
 but are not limited to: hosting our internal network and communication
systems; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; supply/demand planning; production; shipping product to customers; hosting
our branded websites and marketing products to consumers; collecting and storing customer
 consumer
 employee
 investor
 and other
data; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting
 processing
 and sharing confidential
and proprietary research
 business plans
 and financial information; complying with regulatory
 legal or tax requirements; providing
data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business.

Increased
IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems
 networks
 and
services
 as well as the confidentiality
 availability
 and integrity of our data. If the IT systems
 networks
 or service providers
we rely upon fail to function properly
 or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information
 due to
any number of causes
 ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches
 and our business continuity plans
do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis
 we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and
reputational
 competitive and/or business harm
 which may adversely affect our business operations and/or financial condition.
In addition
 such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information
 and we may suffer financial
and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners
 our employees
customers
 suppliers or consumers. In any of these events
 we could also be required to spend significant financial and other
resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems. The trend toward public
notifications of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business operations or financial condition.

Either
our or our strategic partners&rsquo; failure to protect our respective intellectual property rights could compromise our competitive
position and decrease the value of our brand portfolio.

Our
business and prospects depend in part on our
 and with respect to our agency or joint venture brands
 our strategic partners&rsquo;
ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of our brands and trademarks. Although both we and our strategic partners actively
apply for intellectual property registrations of our brands and trademarks
 they could be imitated in ways that we cannot prevent.
Also
 we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how
 concepts and formulas. We cannot be certain that the steps taken to protect
these intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect these rights. Our business could be adversely affected by the
material infringement of such intellectual property rights. We are also subject to risks and costs associated with the enforcement
of our and our partners&rsquo; intellectual property rights. Moreover
 we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement
of third parties&rsquo; rights that could interfere with our use of this information. Defending these claims may be costly and
if unsuccessful
 may prevent us from continuing to use this proprietary information in the future and result in a judgment or
monetary damages being levied against us. We do not maintain non-competition agreements with all of our key personnel or with
some of our key suppliers. If competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to our or our strategic partners&rsquo;
trade secrets
 proprietary know-how or recipes
 the appeal
 and thus the value
 of our brand portfolio could be reduced
 negatively
impacting our financial results and ability to develop our business.


    
    



Our
failure to attract or retain key executive or employee talent could adversely affect our business.

Our
success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team
 other key employees
 and a high-quality employee
base
 as well as our ability to attract
 motivate
 reward
 and retain them. We do not maintain and do not intend to obtain key
man insurance on the life of any executive or employee. Difficulties in hiring or retaining key executive or employee talent
or the unexpected loss of experienced employees could have an adverse impact on our business performance. In addition
 we could
experience business disruption and/or increased costs related to organizational changes
 reductions in workforce
 or other cost-cutting
measures.

The
sales of our products could decrease significantly if we cannot maintain listings in the control states.

In
the control states
 the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and
offered for sale in their respective states. Products selected for listing must generally reach certain volumes and/or profit
levels to maintain their listings. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally
made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Products not selected for listings can only
be purchased by consumers in the applicable control state through special orders
 if at all. If
 in the future
 we are unable
to maintain our current listings in the control states
 or secure and maintain listings in those states for any additional products
we may acquire
 sales of our products could decrease significantly.

An
impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results
and shareholders&rsquo; equity.

The
carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as
of the acquisition date
 net of any cumulative impairments. The carrying value of other intangible assets represents the fair
value of trademarks
 trade names and other acquired intangible assets as of the acquisition date
 net of impairments and accumulated
amortization. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized
but must be evaluated for impairment by our management at least annually. If carrying value exceeds current fair value as determined
based on the discounted future cash flows of the related business
 the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced
to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. If the value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets is impaired
 our
earnings and shareholders&rsquo; equity could be adversely affected.

Risks
Related to Our Industry

Demand
for our products may be adversely affected by many factors
 including changes in consumer preferences and trends.

Consumer
preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic and social trends
 public health initiatives
product innovations
 changes in vacation or leisure activity patterns and a downturn in economic conditions
 which may reduce
consumers&rsquo; willingness to purchase distilled spirits or cause a shift in consumer preferences toward beer
 wine or non-alcoholic
beverages. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in
consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations. The competitive position of our brands could also be
affected adversely by any failure to achieve consistent
 reliable quality in the product or in service levels to customers.

Our
business performance is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of rum
 whiskey and ginger beer sales.

A
significant part of our business is based on rum
 whiskey and ginger beer sales
 which represented approximately 88% and 87% of
our revenues for fiscal 2018 and 2017
 respectively. Changes in consumer preferences regarding these categories of products may
have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Given the importance of our rum
 whiskey and ginger beer brands to
our overall success
 a significant or sustained decline in volume or selling price of these products would likely have a negative
effect on our growth and our stock price. Additionally
 should we not be successful in our efforts to maintain and increase the
relevance of the brands in the minds of today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s consumer
 our business and operating results could
suffer.

We
face substantial competition in our industry and many factors may prevent us from competing successfully.

We
compete based on product taste and quality
 brand image
 price
 service and ability to innovate in response to consumer preferences.
The global spirits industry is highly competitive and is dominated by several large
 well-funded international companies. It is
possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or effectively or resort
to price competition to sustain market share
 which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.


    
    



Adverse
public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products.

Anti-alcohol
groups have
 in the past
 advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements
 higher taxes and other regulations
designed to discourage alcohol consumption. More restrictive regulations
 negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or
changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption
of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could
 in turn
 significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue
growth
 causing a decline in our results of operations.

Class
action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adversely affect our business.

Companies
in the beverage alcohol industry are
 from time to time
 exposed to class action or other litigation relating to alcohol advertising
product liability
 alcohol abuse problems or health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. It is also possible that governments
could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government funded health care costs. Litigation or assertions
of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry
 and it is possible that we
 as well as our suppliers
could be named in litigation of this type.

Also
lawsuits have been brought in a number of states alleging that beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted
underage consumers in their advertising. Plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants&rsquo; advertisements
 marketing
and promotions violate the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in each of these states and seek repayment
of the family funds expended by the underage consumers. While we have not been named in these lawsuits
 we could be named in similar
lawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend
against
 depleting our cash and diverting our personnel resources and
 if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail
 our
business could be harmed significantly.

Regulatory
decisions and legal
 regulatory and tax changes could limit our business activities
 increase our operating costs and reduce our
margins.

Our
business is subject to extensive regulation in all of the countries in which we operate. This may include regulations regarding
production
 distribution
 marketing
 advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products. We are required to comply with these
regulations and to maintain various permits and licenses. We are also required to conduct business only with holders of licenses
to import
 warehouse
 transport
 distribute and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other governmental
regulations applicable to our industry will not change or become more stringent. Moreover
 because these laws and regulations
are subject to interpretation
 we may not be able to predict when and to what extent liability may arise. Additionally
 due to
increasing public concern over alcohol-related societal problems
 including driving while intoxicated
 underage drinking
 alcoholism
and health consequences from the abuse of alcohol
 various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions or
limits on advertising or other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current
or future regulations and requirements relating to our industry and products could result in monetary penalties
 suspension or
even revocation of our licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm
our business
 as we could find it necessary to raise our prices to maintain profit margins
 which could lower the demand for our
products and reduce our sales and profit potential.

Also
the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation both in the U.S. and internationally (and
 in the
U.S.
 at both the federal and state government levels)
 and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import
and excise duties in most countries around the world. An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly
harm our sales revenue and margins
 both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to
lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol.

We
could face product liability or other related liabilities that increase our costs of operations and harm our reputation.

Although
we maintain liability insurance and will attempt to limit contractually our liability for damages arising from our products
 these
measures may not be sufficient for us to avoid or limit liability. Our product liability insurance coverage is limited to $1.0
million per occurrence and $2.0 million in the aggregate and our general liability umbrella policy is capped at $10.0 million.
Further
 any contractual indemnification and insurance coverage we have from parties supplying our products is limited
 as a practical
matter
 to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by these suppliers.
In any event
 extensive product liability claims could be costly to defend and/or costly to resolve and could harm our reputation.

Contamination
of our products and/or counterfeit or confusingly similar products could harm the image and integrity of
 or decrease customer
support for
 our brands and decrease our sales.

The
success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of them. Contamination
 whether arising accidentally
or through deliberate third-party action
 or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands
 could affect
the demand for our products. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our products
or defects in the distillation
 fermentation or bottling processes could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among
or injury to
 consumers of our products and could result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands. We may also
be required to recall products in the event of contamination or damage. Also
 to the extent that third parties sell products that
are either counterfeit versions of our brands or brands that look like our brands
 consumers of our brands could confuse our products
with products that they consider inferior. This could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn
could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our sales and operations.


    
    



Risks
Relating to Owning Our Stock

The
price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly
 and this may make it difficult for you to resell the shares of our stock
at prices you find attractive.

The
trading price of our common stock
 as reported by the NYSE American
 has ranged from a low of $0.98 to a high of $2.22 per share
for the 52 week period ended March 31
 2018. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate significantly.

The
market price of our stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors
 many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:



    
variations
    in quarterly operating results;

    
general
    economic and business conditions;

    
trading
    prices of similar securities;

    
fluctuations
    in stock market prices and volume;

    
our
    announcements of significant contracts
 milestones or acquisitions;

    
our
    relationships with other companies
 including our suppliers and distributors;

    
our
    ability to obtain needed capital;

    
sales
    of common stock
 conversion of securities convertible into common stock
 exercise of options to purchase common stock or termination
    of stock transfer restrictions;

    
changes
    in financial estimates by securities analysts;

    
additions
    or departures of key personnel;

    
the
    initiation or outcome of litigation or arbitration proceedings; and

    
legislation
    or regulatory policies
 practices or actions.


Any
one of these factors could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Also
 the stock market in recent years
has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have materially affected the market prices of equity securities
of many companies and that often have been unrelated to such companies&rsquo; operating performance. These market fluctuations
have adversely impacted the price of our common stock in the past and may do so in the future. Also
 shareholders may initiate
securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly
 which may cause us to incur substantial
costs and divert our management&rsquo;s time and attention. These factors
 among others
 could significantly depress the price
of our common stock.

We
may not be able to maintain our listing on the NYSE American
 which may limit the ability of our shareholders to sell their common
stock.

If
we do not meet the NYSE American continued listing criteria
 we may be delisted and trading of our common stock could be conducted
in the OTC Bulletin Board or the interdealer quotation systems of the OTC Markets Group Inc. In such case
 a shareholder likely
would find it more difficult to trade our common stock or to obtain accurate market quotations for it. If our common stock is
delisted
 it will become subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock rules
&rdquo; which impose
sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell that common stock to persons other than established customers and &ldquo;accredited
investors.&rdquo; Application of this rule could make broker-dealers unable or unwilling to sell our common stock and limit the
ability of shareholders to sell their common stock in the secondary market.

Our
executive officers
 directors and principal shareholders own a substantial percentage of our voting stock
 which allows them to
significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval. They could make business decisions for us that cause our stock
price to decline.

As
of June 8
 2018
 our executive officers
 directors and principal shareholders beneficially owned approximately 42% of our common
stock
 including options that are exercisable within 60 days of the date of this annual report and assuming full exercise of such
options held by such persons. As a result
 if they act in concert
 they could significantly influence matters requiring approval
by our shareholders
 including the election of directors
 and could have the ability to prevent or cause a corporate transaction
even if other shareholders oppose such action. This concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying
 deterring
or preventing a change of control or other business combination
 which could cause our stock price to decline.

Provisions
in our articles of incorporation
 our bylaws and Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us
 discourage
a takeover and adversely affect existing shareholders.

Our
articles of incorporation
 our bylaws and the Florida Business Corporation Act contain provisions that may have the effect of
making more difficult
 delaying
 or deterring attempts by others to obtain control of our company
 even when these attempts may
be in the best interests of our shareholders. These include provisions limiting the shareholders&rsquo; powers to remove directors.
Our articles of incorporation also authorize our board of directors
 without shareholder approval
 to issue one or more series
of preferred stock
 which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders
of our common stock. Florida law also imposes conditions on certain &ldquo;affiliated transactions&rdquo; with &ldquo;interested
shareholders.&rdquo;


    
    



These
provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our
control or management
 including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then
current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem
to be in their best interests.


Negative
publicity could affect our stock price and business performance.

Unfavorable
media related to our industry
 company
 brands
 marketing
 personnel
 operations
 business performance
 or prospects could negatively
affect our corporate reputation
 stock price
 ability to attract high quality talent
 and/or the performance of our business
regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. Adverse publicity or negative commentary on social media outlets could cause consumers
to avoid our brands and/or choose brands offered by our competitors
 which could negatively affect our financial results.

2. Properties

Our
executive offices are located in New York

 Ireland under a lease that expires
in October 2019 and approximately 1
700 square feet of office space in Houston
 TX under a lease that expires in June 2021.

Item
3. Legal Proceedings

We
believe that neither we nor any of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is currently subject to litigation which
 in the opinion of our
management
 is likely to have a material adverse effect on us.

We
may
 however
 become involved in litigation from time to time relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business.
These claims
 even if not meritorious
 could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

Item
7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations



Our
objective is to continue building Castle Brands into a profitable international spirits company
 with a distinctive portfolio
of premium and super premium spirits brands. To achieve this
 we continue to seek to:



    
    
focus
 We continue to focus our distribution efforts
 sales expertise and targeted
    marketing activities on our more profitable brands and markets;

    
    
    

    
    
grow
We believe that continued organic growth will enable us to achieve long-term profitability. We focus
    on brands that have profitable growth potential and staying power
 such as our rums and whiskeys and ginger beer
 sales
    of which have grown substantially in recent years;

    
    
    

    
    
build
 We use our existing assets
 expertise and resources to build consumer awareness and market penetration
    for our brands;

    
    
    

    
    
leverage
 Our established distribution network in all 50 U.S. states enables us to promote our brands
    nationally and makes us an attractive strategic partner for smaller companies seeking U.S. distribution; and

    
    
    

    
    
selectively add new brand
We
                                         intend to continue to introduce new brand extensions and expressions. For example
 we
                                         have leveraged our successful Jefferson&rsquo;s portfolio by introducing a number of
                                         brand extensions. Additionally
 we recently added the Arran Scotch Whiskeys to
                                         our portfolio as agency brands. We continue to explore strategic relationships
 joint
                                         ventures and acquisitions to selectively expand our premium spirits portfolio. We expect
                                         that future acquisitions or agency relations
 if any
 would involve some combination
                                         of cash
 debt and the issuance of our stock.



Recent
Developments

Expansion
of our Credit Facility


 2018
 we
 and
our wholly-owned subsidiary
 Castle Brands (USA) Corp. (&ldquo;CB-USA&rdquo;)
 entered into a Fourth Amendment (the &ldquo;Fourth
Amendment&rdquo;) to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
 dated as of September 22
 2014
 with ACF FinCo I LP
(&ldquo;ACF&rdquo;)
 to amend certain terms of the existing $21.0 million revolving credit facility (the &ldquo;Facility&rdquo;)
with ACF. Among other changes
 the Fourth Amendment increased the maximum amount of the Facility from $21.0 million to $23.0 million
and amended the definition of borrowing base to increase the amount of borrowing that can be collateralized by inventory. We paid
ACF an aggregate $20
000 commitment fee in connection with the Fourth Amendment. In connection with the Fourth Amendment
 we also
entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note.


    
    



Extension
of our 11% Subordinated Note


On
April 17
 2018
 we entered into a First Amendment (the &ldquo;Note Amendment&rdquo;) to the 11% Subordinated Note due 2019
 dated
March 29
 2017
 in the principal amount of $20.0 million with Frost Nevada Investments Trust (the &ldquo;Frost Note&rdquo;)
 an
entity affiliated with Phillip Frost
 M.D.
 a director and a principal shareholder of ours. The purpose of the Note Amendment
was to extend the maturity date on the Frost Note from March 15
 2019 until September 15
 2020. No other provisions of the Frost
Note were amended.

Craft
Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2017

We
expect to benefit from changes to excise tax rates resulting from the enactment of the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform
Act of 2017. The amount of such benefit cannot be quantified at this time. We are awaiting the announcement of
 and establishment
of
 appropriate procedures by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
regarding such excise tax changes.

Operations
overview

We
generate revenue through the sale of our products to our network of wholesale distributors or
 in control states
 state-operated
agencies
 which
 in turn
 distribute our products to retail outlets. In the U.S.
 our sales price per case includes excise tax
and import duties
 which are also reflected as a corresponding increase in our cost of sales. Most of our international sales
are sold &ldquo;in bond&rdquo;
 with the excise taxes paid by our customers upon shipment
 thereby resulting in lower relative
revenue as well as a lower relative cost of sales
 although some of our United Kingdom sales are sold &ldquo;tax paid&rdquo;
as in the U.S. The difference between sales and net sales principally reflects adjustments for various distributor incentives.

Our
gross profit is determined by the prices at which we sell our products
 our ability to control our cost of sales
 the relative
mix of our case sales by brand and geography and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our cost of sales is principally
driven by our cost of procurement
 bottling and packaging
 which differs by brand
 as well as freight and warehousing costs. We
purchase certain products
 such as Goslings rums and ginger beer
 Pallini liqueurs
 Arran whiskeys
 and Gozio amaretto
as finished goods. For other products
 such as Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbons
 we purchase the components
 including the distilled
spirits
 bottles and packaging materials
 and have arrangements with third parties for bottling and packaging. Our U.S. sales
typically have a higher absolute gross margin than in other markets
 as sales prices per case are generally higher in the U.S.

Selling
expense principally includes advertising and marketing expenditures and compensation paid to our marketing and sales personnel.
Our selling expense
 as a percentage of sales and per case
 is higher than that of our competitors because of our brand development
costs
 level of marketing expenditures and established sales force versus our relatively small base of case sales and sales volumes.
However
 we believe that maintaining an infrastructure capable of supporting future growth is the correct long-term approach for
us.

While
we expect the absolute level of selling expense to increase in the coming years
 we expect selling expense as a percentage of
revenues and on a per case basis to decline or remain constant
 as our volumes expand and our sales team sells a larger number
of brands.

General
and administrative expense relates to corporate and administrative functions that support our operations and includes administrative
payroll
 occupancy and related expenses and professional services. We expect general and administrative expense in fiscal 2019
to be higher than fiscal 2018 due to costs associated with increased infrastructure to support our growth. However
 we expect
our general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales to decline due to economies of scale.

We
expect to increase our case sales in the U.S. and internationally over the next several years through organic growth
 and through
the introduction of product line extensions
 acquisitions and distribution agreements. We will seek to maintain liquidity and
manage our working capital and overall capital resources during this period of anticipated growth to achieve our long-term objectives
although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.

We
continue to believe the following industry trends will create growth opportunities for us
 including:



    
the
    divestiture of smaller and emerging non-core brands by major spirits companies as they continue to consolidate;

    
    

    
increased
    barriers to entry
 particularly in the U.S.
 due to continued consolidation and the difficulty in establishing an extensive
    distribution network
 such as the one we maintain; and

    
    

    
the
    trend by small private and family-owned spirits brand owners to partner with
 or be acquired by
 a company with global distribution.
    We expect to be an attractive alternative to our larger competitors for these brand owners as one of the few modestly-sized
    publicly-traded spirits companies.


Our
growth strategy is based upon growing existing brands
 partnering with other brands and acquiring smaller and emerging brands.
To identify potential partner and acquisition candidates we plan to rely on our management&rsquo;s industry experience and our
extensive network of industry contacts. We also plan to maintain and grow our U.S. and international distribution channels so
that we are more attractive to spirits companies who are looking for a route to market for their products. We expect to compete
for foreign and small private and family-owned spirits brands by offering flexible and creative structures
 which present an alternative
to the larger spirits companies.



    
    



We
intend to finance any future brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources
 third party financing and
in appropriate circumstances
 the further issuance of equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring additional brands could have a
significant effect on our financial position
 and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results.
Also
 the pursuit of acquisitions and other new business relationships may require significant management attention. We may not
be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates
 obtain financing on favorable terms or complete these types
of transactions in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us
 if at all.

Critical
accounting policies and estimates

A
number of estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 amounts of sales and expenses and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis
 we evaluate these estimates and assumptions
based on historical experience and other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under
the circumstances; however
 actual results may differ from these estimates.

We
believe that the estimates and assumptions discussed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
results of operations in that they require our most difficult
 subjective or complex judgments and form the basis for the accounting
policies deemed to be most critical to our operations.

Revenue
recognition


title and risk of loss has passed to the customer under the terms of sale (FOB shipping point) and collection is reasonably assured.
We do not offer a right of return but will accept returns if we shipped the wrong product or wrong quantity. Revenue is not recognized
on shipments to control states in the U.S. until such time as the product is sold through to the retail channel.

Accounts
receivable

We
record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts.
We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs
 level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables
and our relationships with
 and economic status of
 our customers.

Inventory
valuation

Our
inventory
 which consists of distilled spirits
 non-beverage alcohol products
 dry good raw materials (bottles
 cans
 labels and
caps)
 packaging
 excise taxes
 freight and finished goods
 is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 using
the weighted average cost method. We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories
that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value. We estimate the net realizable value
of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including
 but not limited to
 historical usage
 future demand and market
requirements. Reduction to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold.


    
    



Goodwill
and other intangible assets

At
each of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 we had $0.5 million of goodwill that arose from acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess
of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses
acquired. Intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of rights
 trademarks
 trade names and formulations. We are
required to analyze our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as well as
when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In testing goodwill for impairment
 we have the option
to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that
it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not
 we are then required
to perform a quantitative impairment test
 otherwise no further analysis is required. We may also elect not to perform the qualitative
assessment and
 instead
 proceed direct to the quantitative impairment test. Under the goodwill qualitative assessment
 various
events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified
 including
 but not limited
to: prior years&rsquo; impairment testing results
 budget to actual results
 Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry
developments
 and the economic environment.

Under
the goodwill two-step quantitative impairment test we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
assets at the reporting unit level. In the first step the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including
goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value
 a second step is performed which compares the implied
fair value of the reporting unit&rsquo;s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. The fair value for the goodwill is determined
based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and
liabilities of such reporting units. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value
 the difference is recognized
as an impairment.

Under
the goodwill qualitative assessment at March 31
 2018 and 2017
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated
fair value of each reporting unit were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&rsquo; impairment testing results
budget to actual results
 Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based
on this assessment
 we determined that no quantitative assessment was required. We did not record any impairment on goodwill or
other intangible assets for fiscal 2018
 2017 or 2016.

Intangible
assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values
and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
We are required to amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to the
estimated residual values and to review intangible assets with estimable useful lives for impairment in accordance with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 310
 &ldquo;Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-lived Assets.&rdquo;

Stock-based
awards


 which requires all share-based
payments
 including grants of stock options and restricted stock
 to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense
based on their fair values on the grant date. Stock-based compensation was $2.0 million
 $1.6 million and $1.4 million for fiscal
2018
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted.
The assumptions used in valuing the options granted during fiscal 2017 and 2016 are included in note 12 to our accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

Fair
value of financial instruments

ASC
825
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments&rdquo;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial
instruments. We believe that there is no material difference between the fair value and the reported amounts of financial instruments
in the balance sheets due to the short-term maturity of these instruments
 or with respect to the debt
 as compared to the current
borrowing rates available to us.

Earnings

 adjusted for allowances for doubtful accounts and obsolete inventory
stock-based compensation expense
 transaction fees
 other expense (income)
 net
 income from equity investment in non-consolidated
affiliate
 foreign exchange loss (income) and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is a key metric
we use in evaluating our financial performance. EBITDA
 as adjusted
 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by
Regulation G promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended. We consider EBITDA
 as adjusted
 important in
evaluating our performance on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-cash and non-recurring
items
 EBITDA
 as adjusted
 enables our Board of Directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent
basis. We use EBITDA
 as adjusted
 as a primary measure
 among others
 to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning
decisions regarding future operating investments and allocation of capital resources. We believe that EBITDA
 as adjusted
 eliminates
items that are not indicative of our core operating performance or are based on management&rsquo;s estimates
 such as allowance
accounts
 are due to changes in valuation
 such as the effects of changes in foreign exchange or do not involve a cash outlay
such as stock-based compensation expense. Our presentation of EBITDA
 as adjusted
 should not be construed as an inference that
our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items or by non-cash items
 such as stock-based compensation
which is expected to remain a key element in our long-term incentive compensation program. EBITDA
 as adjusted
 should be considered
in addition to
 rather than as a substitute for
 income from operations
 net income and cash flows from operating activities.

Our
EBITDA
 as adjusted
 improved to $7.3 million for the year ended March 31
 2018
 as compared to $5.2 million for the prior fiscal
year
 primarily as a result of our increased sales and gross profit. Our EBITDA
 as adjusted
 improved to $5.2 million for the
year ended March 31
 2017
 as compared to $3.6 million for the prior year
 primarily as a result of our increased sales and gross
profit.

Fiscal
2018 compared with fiscal 2017

Net
sales increased 16.3% to $89.9 million for the year ended March 31
 2018
 as compared to $77.3 million for the prior fiscal year
primarily due to U.S. sales growth of our whiskey portfolio
 Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer and certain liqueur brands
 partially
offset by decreases in vodka and rum sales. For the year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of our Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer increased
32.7% to $26.5 million. We anticipate continued growth of Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer in the near term due to the popularity of
cocktails containing ginger beer
 Goslings brand awareness and the distribution to large national and regional retailers and on-premise
accounts
 although there is no assurance that we will attain such results. The launch of Arran whiskeys during the year
ended March 31
 2018 contributed $1.2 million in sales. We continue to focus on our faster growing brands and markets
 both in

percentage of total spirits case sales increased to 19.6% for the year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to 18.0% for the
prior fiscal year
 primarily due to increased Irish whiskey and rum sales in certain international markets resulting in part from
the timing of shipments to large retailers in Ireland and Scandinavia.

Gross profit increased 14.2% to $36.2 million for the year ended March 31
 2018 from $31.7 million for the prior fiscal year
while gross margin decreased to 40.4% for the year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to 41.0% for the prior fiscal year. The increase
in gross profit was due to increased aggregate revenue in the current period
 partially offset by increased cost of sales in the
current period. The small decrease in gross margin was primarily due to pricing of some of our ancillary brands. We expect that
gross margin in the near term will be impacted negatively by a temporary increase in our bulk bourbon costs
 but positively
impacted by the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act 2017. During the year ended March 31
 2018
 we recorded an
addition to the allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory of $0.4 million as compared to $0.2 million for the prior
fiscal year. We recorded these write-offs and allowances on both raw materials and finished goods
 primarily in connection with
label and packaging changes made to certain brands
 as well as certain cost estimates and variances. The net charges have been
recorded as an increase to cost of sales in the relevant period.

Selling
expense
 2018 from $20.1 million for the prior
fiscal year
 primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in advertising
 marketing and promotion expense related to the timing of
certain sales and marketing programs
 including Goslings&rsquo; sponsorship of the 35th America&rsquo;s Cup
 a $0.5 million increase
in shipping costs and a $0.3 million increase in commission expense from increased sales volume
 partially offset by a $0.5 million
decrease in employee expense. Selling expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 24.2% for the year ended March 31
 2018
as compared to 26.0% for the prior fiscal year.


    
    



General
and administrative expense.
2018 from $8.6 million for the prior fiscal year
 primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in professional fees and a $0.5 million
increase in compensation costs. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 10.5% for the year
ended March 31
 2018 as compared to 11.2% for the prior fiscal year.

Depreciation
and amortization.
 2018 as compared to $1.0 million
for the prior fiscal year.

Income
from operations
 we had income from operations of $4.2 million for the year ended March 31
2018 as compared to $1.9 million for the prior fiscal year. As a result of our focus on our stronger growth markets and better
performing brands
 we anticipate improved results of operations in the near term as compared to prior years
 although there is
no assurance that we will attain such results.

Income tax expense
Income tax expense
 net is the estimated tax
benefit or expense primarily attributable to the net taxable income recorded by GCP
 our 80.1% owned subsidiary
 adjusted for
changes in the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability during the periods
 and was a net expense of ($0.1)
million for the year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to a net expense of ($0.2) million for the prior fiscal year.

Foreign
exchange (loss) gain.
 2018 was $0.1 million as compared to a gain of $0.1
million for the prior fiscal year due to the net effects of fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and its impact on
our Euro-denominated intercompany balances due to our foreign subsidiaries for inventory purchases.

Interest expense
We had interest expense
 net of ($3.8) million
for the year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to ($1.3) million for the prior fiscal year due to balances outstanding under our
credit facilities and long-term debt. Due to the debt incurred to finance the GCP Share Acquisition
 and expected borrowings under
credit facilities to finance additional purchases of aged whiskeys in support of the growth of our Jefferson&rsquo;s whiskeys
and other working capital needs
 we expect interest expense
 net to increase in the near term as compared to prior years.

Net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests.
31
 2018 as compared to ($1.4) million for the comparable prior year period
 both as a result of net income allocated to the 19.9%
noncontrolling interests in GCP in the year ended March 31
 2018 and the 40.0% noncontrolling interests in GCP in the year ended
March 31
 2017. The change in noncontrolling interests from our acquisition of an additional 20.1% of GCP occurred in March 2017.

Net loss attributable
to common shareholders.
 net loss attributable to common shareholders improved
to ($0.8) million for the year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to ($0.9) million for the prior fiscal year. Net loss per
common share
 basic and diluted
 was ($0.01) per share for the each of the years ended March 31
 2018 and 2017.


Fiscal
2017 compared with fiscal 2016

Net
sales.
 2017
 as compared to $72.2 million for the prior
fiscal year
 primarily due to U.S. sales growth of Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbons and Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer
 partially offset
by decreases in vodka and international Irish whiskey sales. For the year ended March 31
 2017
 sales of our Goslings Stormy Ginger
Beer increased 23.3% to $20.0 million. We anticipate continued growth of Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer in the near term due to the
popularity of cocktails containing ginger beer
 Goslings brand awareness and the distribution to large national and regional retailers
and on-premise accounts
 although there is no assurance that we will attain such results. We continue to focus on our faster growing
brands and markets
 both in the U.S. and internationally.

Our
international spirits case sales as a percentage of total spirits case sales decreased to 18.0% for the year ended March 31

as compared to 20.1% for the prior fiscal year
 primarily due to decreased Irish whiskey and rum sales in certain international
markets resulting in part from the timing of shipments to large retailers in Great Britain and Scandinavia.

Gross
profit.
 2017 from $28.6 million for the prior fiscal
year
 while gross margin increased to 41.0% for the year ended March 31
 2017 as compared to 39.5% for the prior fiscal year.
The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased aggregate revenue in the current period. During each of the years
ended March 31
 2017 and 2016
 we recorded additions to allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory of $0.2 million. We recorded
these write-offs and allowances on both raw materials and finished goods
 primarily in connection with label and packaging changes
made to certain brands
 as well as certain cost estimates and variances. The net charges have been recorded as an increase to
cost of sales in the relevant period. Net of the allowances for obsolete inventories
 gross margin for the year ended March 31
2017 was 41.2% as compared to 39.8% for the prior-year period.

Selling
expense
 2017 from $19.2 million for the prior
fiscal year
 primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in advertising
 marketing and promotion expense related to the timing of
certain sales and marketing programs
 including Goslings&rsquo; sponsorship of the 35th America&rsquo;s Cup
 and a $0.9 million
increase in salaries and personnel expense due to increased staff and compensation costs
 including a $0.2 million increase in
travel and entertainment expense
 partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in shipping costs from lower sales volume. Selling
expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.0% for the year ended March 31
 2017 as compared to 26.6% for the prior fiscal
year due to increased sales.

General
and administrative expense
2017 from $7.4 million for the prior fiscal year
 primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in salaries and personnel expense due
to increased staff and compensation costs
 $0.3 million increase in professional fees due to the GCP Share Acquisition
 and a
$0.1 million increase each in insurance costs
 occupancy expense and stock compensation expense for our Board of Directors. Increased
revenue for the year partially offset the increase in general and administrative expenses
 which resulted in general and administrative
expense as a percentage of net sales increasing to 11.2% for the year ended March 31
 2017 as compared to 10.2% for the prior
fiscal year.

Depreciation
and amortization.
 2017 as compared to $0.9 million
for the prior fiscal year.

Income
from operations
 we had income from operations of $1.9 million for the year ended March 31
2017 as compared to income from operations of $1.0 million for the prior fiscal year. As a result of our focus on our stronger
growth markets and better performing brands
 and expected growth from our existing brands
 we anticipate improved results of operations
in the near term as compared to prior years
 although there is no assurance that we will attain such results.

Income
tax expense
 net.
 net is the estimated tax expense primarily attributable to the net taxable income recorded
by our GCP subsidiary
 adjusted for changes in the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability during the periods
 and was net
expense of ($0.2) million for the year ended March 31
 2017 as compared to net expense of ($1.5) million for the prior fiscal
year. The net tax expense for the year ended March 31
 2017 is net of a $0.4 million tax benefit from the change in our deferred
tax liability.

Foreign
exchange gain (loss).
 2017 was $0.1 million as compared to a loss of ($0.2)
million for the prior fiscal year due to the net effects of fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and its impact on
our Euro-denominated intercompany balances due to our foreign subsidiaries for inventory purchases.

Interest
expense
 net. 
 net of ($1.3) million for the year ended March 31
 2017 as compared to ($1.1) million
for the prior fiscal year due to balances outstanding under our credit facilities. Due to expected borrowings under credit facilities
to finance additional purchases of aged whiskeys in support of the growth of our Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbons and other working
capital needs
 we expect interest expense
 net to increase in the near term as compared to prior years.

Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
the year ended March 31
 2017 as compared to $0.8 million for the prior fiscal year
 both the result of net income allocated to
the 40.0% noncontrolling interests in GCP. The change in noncontrolling interests from our acquisition of an additional 20.1%
of GCP occurred at the end of March 2017 and was immaterial on our results.

Liquidity
and capital resources



Since
our inception
 we have incurred significant operating and net losses and have not generated positive cash flows from operations.
For the year ended March 31
 2018
 we had net income of $0.3 million
 and used cash of $5.6 million in operating activities.
As of March 31
 2018
 we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.4 million and had an accumulated deficit of $149.9 million.

We
believe our current cash and working capital and the availability under the Credit Facility (as defined below) will enable us
to fund our losses until we achieve profitability
 ensure continuity of supply of our brands
 and support new brand initiatives
and marketing programs through at least June 2019. The Company can continue to meet its operating needs through additional mechanisms
including additional or expanded debt financings
 potential equity offerings and limiting or adjusting the timing of additional
inventory purchases based on available resources.




 we
and our wholly-owned subsidiary
 CB-USA
 entered into a Fourth Amendment (the &ldquo;Fourth Amendment&rdquo;) to the Amended
and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
 dated as of September 22
 2014
 with ACF FinCo I LP (&ldquo;ACF&rdquo;)
 to amend
certain terms of the existing $21.0 million revolving credit facility (the &ldquo;Credit Facility&rdquo;) with ACF.
Among other changes
 the Fourth Amendment increased the maximum amount of the Facility from $21.0 million to $23.0 million
and amended the definition of borrowing base to increase the amount of borrowing that can be collateralized by inventory. We
paid ACF an aggregate $20
000 commitment fee in connection with the Fourth Amendment. In connection with the Fourth
Amendment
 we also entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note.


we entered into a First Amendment (the &ldquo;Note Amendment&rdquo;) to the 11% Subordinated Note due 2019
 dated March 29
 2017
in the principal amount of $20.0 million with Frost Nevada Investments Trust (the &ldquo;Subordinated Note&rdquo;)
 an entity affiliated
with Phillip Frost
 M.D.
 a director and a principal shareholder of ours. The purpose of the Note Amendment was to extend the
maturity date on the Subordinated Note from March 15
 2019 until September 15
 2020. No other provisions of the Subordinated Note were amended.


 CB-USA
 are parties to an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
(as amended
 the &ldquo;Loan Agreement&rdquo;) with ACF
 which provides for availability (subject to certain terms and conditions)
of a facility to provide us with working capital
 including capital to finance purchases of
aged whiskeys in support of the growth of our Jefferson&rsquo;s whiskeys
 in the amount of $23.0 million
 including a sublimit
in the maximum principal amount of $7.0 million to permit us to acquire aged whiskey inventory (the &ldquo;Purchased Inventory
Sublimit&rdquo;) subject to certain conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Credit Facility matures on July 31
 2019 (the
&ldquo;Maturity Date&rdquo;). The monthly facility fee is 0.75% per annum of the maximum Credit Facility amount (excluding the
Purchased Inventory Sublimit).

Pursuant
to the Loan Agreement
 we and CB-USA may borrow up to the lesser of (x) $23.0 million and (y) the sum of the borrowing base calculated
in accordance with the Loan Agreement and the Purchased Inventory Sublimit. We and CB-USA may prepay the Credit Facility in whole
or the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 in whole or in part
 subject to certain prepayment penalties as set forth in the Loan Agreement.

ACF
required as a condition to entering into an amendment to the Loan Agreement in August 2015 that ACF enter into a participation
agreement with certain related parties of ours
 including Frost Gamma Investments Trust
 an entity affiliated with Phillip Frost
M.D.
 a director of ours and a principal shareholder of ours ($150
000)
 Mark E. Andrews
 III
 a director of ours and our Chairman
($50
000)
 Richard J. Lampen
 a director of ours and our President and Chief Executive Officer ($100
000)
 Brian L. Heller
 our
General Counsel and Assistant Secretary ($42
500)
 and Alfred J. Small
 our Senior Vice President
 Chief Financial Officer
 Treasurer
 ($15
000)
 to allow for the sale of participation
interests in the Purchased Inventory Sublimit and the inventory purchased with the proceeds thereof. The participation agreement
provides that ACF&rsquo;s commitment to fund each advance of the Purchased Inventory Sublimit shall be limited to seventy percent
(70%)
 up to an aggregate maximum principal amount for all advances equal to $4.9 million. Under the terms of the participation
agreement
 the participants receive interest at the rate of 11% per annum. We are not a party to the participation agreement.
However
 we and CB-USA are party to a fee letter with the junior participants (including the related party junior participants)
pursuant to which we and CB-USA were obligated to pay the junior participants a closing fee of $18
000 on the effective date of
the amendment to the Loan Agreement and are obligated to pay a commitment fee of $18
000 on each anniversary of the effective
date until the junior participants&rsquo; obligations are terminated pursuant to the participation agreement.

We
may borrow up to the maximum amount of the Credit Facility
 provided that we have a sufficient borrowing base (as defined in the
Loan Agreement). The Credit Facility interest rate (other than with respect to the Purchased Inventory Sublimit) is the rate that
when annualized
 is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 3.00%
 (b) the LIBOR Rate plus 5.50% and (c) 6.0%. The interest rate
applicable to the Purchased Inventory Sublimit is the rate
 that when annualized
 is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 4.25%
(b) the LIBOR Rate plus 6.75% and (c) 7.50%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears
 on the first day of every month on the average
daily unpaid principal amount of the Credit Facility. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any &ldquo;Default&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Event of Default&rdquo; (as defined under the Loan Agreement) we are required to pay interest at a rate that is 3.25%
per annum above the then applicable Credit Facility interest rate. The Loan Agreement contains EBITDA targets allowing for further
interest rate reductions in the future. The Credit Facility currently bears interest at 7.358050% (reflecting a discount for achieving
one such EBITDA target) and the Purchased Inventory Sublimit currently bears interest at 9.10805%. We are required to pay down
the principal balance of the Purchased Inventory Sublimit within 15 banking days from the completion of a bottling run of bourbon
from our bourbon inventory stock purchased with funds borrowed under the Purchased Inventory Sublimit in an amount equal to the
purchase price of such bourbon. The unpaid principal balance of the Credit Facility
 all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
and all fees
 costs and expenses payable in connection with the Credit Facility
 are due and payable in full on the Maturity Date.
In addition to closing fees
 ACF receives facility fees and a collateral management fee (each as set forth in the Loan Agreement).
Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by the grant of a pledge and a security interest in all of our assets.

The
Loan Agreement contains standard borrower representations and warranties for asset-based borrowing and a number of reporting obligations
and affirmative and negative covenants. The Loan Agreement includes negative covenants that
 among other things
 restrict our
ability to create additional indebtedness
 dispose of properties
 incur liens
 and make distributions or cash dividends. At March
31
 2018
 we were in compliance
 in all material respects
 with the covenants under the Loan Agreement.


 we issued the Subordinated Note. In April 2018
 we entered into a first amendment to the Subordinated
Note to extend the maturity date on the Subordinated Note from March 15
 2019 until September 15
 2020. No other provisions of
the Subordinated Note were amended. The purpose of the Subordinated Note was to finance the GCP Share Acquisition. The Subordinated
Note
 as amended
 bears interest quarterly at the rate of 11% per annum. The principal and interest accrued thereon is due and
payable in full on September 15
 2020. All claims of the holder of the Subordinated Note to principal
 interest and any
other amounts owed under the Subordinated Note are subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Company existing
as of the date of the Subordinated Note. The Subordinated Note contains customary events of default and may be prepaid by the
Company
 in whole or in part
 without penalty
 at any time.

In
December 2009
 GCP issued a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $0.2 million to Gosling&rsquo;s Export (Bermuda)
Limited in exchange for credits issued on certain inventory purchases. This note matures on April 1
 2020
 is payable at maturity
subject to certain acceleration events
 and calls for annual interest of 5%
 to be accrued and paid at maturity.

We
have arranged various credit facilities aggregating &euro;0.3 million or $0.4 million (translated at the March 31
 2018 exchange
rate) with an Irish bank
 including overdraft coverage
 creditors&rsquo; insurance
 customs and excise guaranty and a revolving
credit facility. These facilities are payable on demand
 continue until terminated by either party
 are subject to annual review
and call for interest at the lender&rsquo;s AA1 Rate minus 1.70%. We have deposited &euro;0.3 million or $0.4 million (translated
at the March 31
 2018 exchange rate) with the bank to secure these borrowings.



    
    





 we issued
an aggregate principal amount of $2.1 million of unsecured 5% convertible subordinated notes (the &ldquo;Convertible Notes&rdquo;).
As of March 31
 2018
 we had $50
000 of Convertible Notes outstanding. We used a portion of the proceeds to finance the acquisition
of additional bourbon inventory in support of the growth of our Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbon brand. The Convertible Notes bear interest
at a rate of 5% per annum and mature on December 15
 2018. The Convertible Notes
 and accrued but unpaid interest thereon
 are
convertible in whole or in part from time to time at the option of the holders thereof into shares of our common stock
 par value
$0.01 per share
 at a conversion price of $0.90 per share (the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo;). The Convertible Notes may be prepaid
in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium
 but with payment of accrued interest to the date of prepayment. The
Convertible Notes contain customary events of default
 which
 if uncured
 entitle each noteholder to accelerate the due date of
the unpaid principal amount of
 and all accrued and unpaid interest on
 the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note purchasers
included certain related parties of ours
 including an affiliate of Dr. Phillip Frost ($500
000)
 Mark E. Andrews
 III ($50
000)
an affiliate of Richard J. Lampen ($50
000) and Vector Group Ltd.
 a more than 5% shareholder of ours
 of which Richard Lampen
is an executive officer
 Henry Beinstein
 a director of ours
 is a director and Phillip Frost
 M.D. is a principal shareholder
($200
000)
 all of whom converted the outstanding principal and interest balances of their Convertible Notes into shares of our
common stock in the year ended March 31
 2018.



all or any part of the Convertible Notes and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon if (i) the average daily volume of the common
stock (as reported on the principal market or exchange on which the common stock is listed or quoted for trading) exceeds
$50
000 per trading day and (ii) the volume weighted average price of the common stock for at least twenty (20) trading
days during any thirty (30) consecutive trading day period exceeds 250% of the then-current Conversion Price. Any forced conversion
will be applied ratably to the holders of all Convertible Notes based on each holder&rsquo;s then-current note holdings.



31
 2018
 certain holders of the Convertible Notes
 including the related party holders described above
 converted an aggregate
$1
632
000 of the outstanding principal and interest balances of their Convertible Notes into 1
813
334 shares of our common stock
pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes.







 2018
we had shareholders&rsquo; equity of $8.0 million as compared to $3.6 million at March 31
 2017. This increase in
shareholders&rsquo; equity was due to the exercise of stock options and stock-based compensation expense of $2.2 million
 the
issuance of $1.6 million of common stock upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes and by our $0.5 million total comprehensive
income for the year ended March 31
 2018.


of $38.6 million at March 31
 2018 as compared to $31.2 million at March 31
 2017
 primarily due to net income of $0.5
million
 a $5.8 million increase in inventory
 a $2.1 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $1.7
million increase in accounts receivable.


As
of March 31
 2018
 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.4 million
 as compared to $0.6 million as of March 31
2017. The decrease is primarily attributable to the funding of our operations and working capital needs. At March 31
 2018 and
2017
 we also had approximately $0.4 million (translated at the March 31
 2018 exchange rate) and $0.3 million (translated at
the March 31
 2017 exchange rate)
 respectively
 of cash restricted from withdrawal and held by a bank in Ireland as collateral
for overdraft coverage
 creditors&rsquo; insurance
 revolving credit and other working capital purposes.

The
following may materially affect our liquidity over the near-to-mid term:




    
    
continued
    cash losses from operations;

    
    
our
    ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing should it be required;

    
    
an
    increase in working capital requirements to finance higher levels of inventories and accounts receivable;

    
    
our
    ability to maintain and improve our relationships with our distributors and our routes to market;

    
    
our
    ability to procure raw materials at a favorable price to support our level of sales;

    
    
potential
    acquisitions of additional brands; and

    
    
expansion
    into new markets and within existing markets in the U.S. and internationally.


We
continue to implement sales and marketing initiatives that we expect will generate cash flows from operations in the next few
years. We seek to grow our business through expansion to new markets
 growth in existing markets and strengthened distributor
relationships. As our brands continue to grow
 our working capital requirements will increase. In particular
 the growth of our
Jefferson&rsquo;s brands requires a significant amount of working capital relative to our other brands
 as we are required to
purchase and hold ever increasing amounts of aged whiskey to meet growing demand. While we are seeking solutions to our long-term
whiskey supply needs
 we are required to purchase and hold several years&rsquo; worth of aged whiskey in inventory until such
time as it is aged to our specific brand taste profiles
 increasing our working capital requirements and negatively impacting
cash flows.

We
may also seek additional brands and agency relationships to leverage our existing distribution platform. We intend to finance
any such brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources
 borrowings and
 in appropriate circumstances
additional issuances of equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial
position
 could materially reduce our liquidity and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating
results. We continue to control expenses
 seek improvements in routes to market and contain production costs to improve cash flows.


    
    



We
currently intend to restructure all or a portion of our debt
 including the Subordinated Note. This restructuring may consist
of a combination of expanding and extending the Loan Agreement and Credit Facility with ACF
 extending the term of the Subordinated
Note
 converting some or all of the debt to equity or paying down the debt with funds that may be raised from future equity
offerings
 although there is no assurance that we will be successful in such restructuring. If we are unable to restructure or
refinance our debt
 or are unable to raise equity on terms that are acceptable to us
 it could have a significant effect on our
financial position
 could materially reduce our liquidity and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly
operating results.

As
of March 31
 2018
 we had borrowed $18.6 million of the $21.0 million then available under the Credit Facility
 including $4.8
million of the $7.0 million available under the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 leaving $0.2 million in potential availability for
working capital needs under the Credit Facility and $2.2 million available for aged whiskey inventory purchases. As of June 7
2018
 we had borrowed $20.0 million of the $23.0 million then available under the amended Credit Facility
 including $6.1
million of the $7.0 million available under the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 leaving $2.1 million in potential availability for
working capital needs under the amended Credit Facility and $0.9 million available for aged whiskey inventory purchases. We believe
our current cash and working capital and the availability under the Credit Facility will enable us to fund our losses until we
achieve profitability
 ensure continuity of supply of our brands
 and support new brand initiatives and marketing programs through
at least June 2019. The Company can continue to meet its operating needs through additional mechanisms including additional
or expanded debt financings
 potential equity offerings and limiting or adjusting the timing of additional inventory purchases
based on available resources.

Operating
A substantial portion of available cash has been used to fund our operating activities. In general
 these
cash funding requirements are based on the costs in maintaining our distribution system and our sales and marketing activities.
We have also utilized cash to fund the purchase of our inventories. In general
 these cash outlays for inventories are
only partially offset by increases in our accounts payable to our suppliers.

On
average
 the production cycle for our owned brands is up to three months from the time we obtain the distilled spirits and other
materials needed to bottle and package our products to the time we receive products available for sale
 in part due to the international
nature of our business. We do not produce Goslings rums or ginger beer
 Pallini liqueurs
 Arran Scotch whiskeys or Gozio
amaretto. Instead
 we receive the finished product directly from the owners of such brands. From the time we have products available
for sale
 an additional two to three months may be required before we sell our inventory and collect payment from customers. Further
our inventory at March 31
 2018 included significant additional stores of aged bourbon purchased in advance of forecasted
production requirements. We expect to use the aged bourbon in the normal course of future sales
 generating positive cash flows
in future periods.


March 31
 2018
 net cash used in operating activities was $5.6 million
 consisting primarily of a $5.8 million increase in inventory
a $2.1 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $1.7 million increase in accounts receivable. These
uses of cash were partially offset by $0.5 million in net income
 a $0.6 million increase in due to related parties
 stock based
compensation expense of $2.0 million
 and depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million

During
the year ended March 31
 2017
 net cash used in operating activities was $1.7 million
 consisting primarily of a $4.3 million
increase in inventory
 a $2.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and a $1.2 million increase in accounts receivable. These uses
of cash were partially offset by $0.5 million in net income
 a $2.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses
stock based compensation expense of $1.6 million
 a $0.8 million increase in due to related parties and depreciation and amortization
expense of $1.0 million.

During
the year ended March 31
 2016
 net cash used in operating activities was $2.9 million
 consisting primarily of a net loss of $1.7
million
 a $6.5 million increase in inventory
 a $0.6 million decrease in due to related parties and a $0.1 million increase in
prepaid expenses and supplies. These uses of cash were partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued
expense
 a $0.1 million increase in due from affiliates
 stock based compensation expense of $1.4 million and depreciation and
amortization expense of $0.9 million.

Interest
payments are based on current interest rates at March 31

to be paid on our revolving credit facility based on the balance outstanding as of March 31
 2018. Interest on the revolving credit
facility is calculated using the prevailing rates as of March 31
 2018. Our estimate assumes that we will maintain the same levels
of indebtedness and financial performance through the credit facility&rsquo;s maturity in July 2019.

Currency
Translation

The
functional currencies for our foreign operations are the Euro in Ireland and the British Pound in the United Kingdom. With respect
to our consolidated financial statements
 the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed
for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using
a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income.

Where
in this annual report we refer to amounts in Euros or British Pounds
 we have for your convenience also in certain cases provided
a conversion of those amounts to U.S. Dollars in parentheses. Where the numbers refer to a specific balance sheet account date
or financial statement account period
 we have used the exchange rate that was used to perform the conversions in connection with
the applicable financial statement. In all other instances
 unless otherwise indicated
 the conversions have been made using the
exchange rates as of March 31
 2018
 each as calculated from the Interbank exchange rates as reported by Oanda.com. On March 31
2018
 the exchange rate of the Euro and the British Pound in exchange for U.S. Dollars was &euro;1.00 = U.S. $1.23187 (equivalent
to U.S.$1.00 = &euro;0.81177) and &pound;1.00 = U.S. $1.40313 (equivalent to U.S.$1.00 = &pound;0.71269).


    
    



These
conversions should not be construed as representations that the Euro and British Pound amounts actually represent U.S. Dollar
amounts or could be converted into U.S. Dollars at the rates indicated.

Impact
of inflation

We
believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate. Inflation and changing
prices did not have a material impact on our operations during fiscal 2018
 2017 or 2016. Severe increases in inflation
 however
could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business
 financial condition and results of
operations.

Recent
accounting pronouncements

We
discuss recently issued and adopted accounting standards in the &ldquo;Accounting standards adopted&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recent accounting
pronouncements&rdquo; sections of note 1 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 that could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and other factors include
those listed under &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; and as follows:




    
our
    history of losses;

    

market conditions could adversely impact our financial performance;

    
our
    potential need for additional capital
 which
 if not available on acceptable terms or at all
 could restrict our future growth
    and severely limit our operations;

    
our
    brands could fail to achieve more widespread consumer acceptance
 which may limit our growth;

    
our
    dependence on a limited number of suppliers
 who may not perform satisfactorily or may end their relationships with us
 which
    could result in lost sales
 incurrence of additional costs or lost credibility in the marketplace;

    
our
    annual purchase obligations with certain suppliers;

    
the
    failure of even a few of our independent wholesale distributors to adequately distribute our products within their territories
    could harm our sales and result in a decline in our results of operations;

    
our
    need to maintain a relatively large inventory of our products to support customer delivery requirements
 which could negatively
    impact our operations if such inventory is lost due to theft
 fire or other damage;

    
the
    potential limitation to our growth if we are unable to identify and successfully acquire additional brands that are complementary
    to our existing portfolio
 or integrate such brands after acquisitions;

    
currency
    exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations may significantly adversely affect our revenues
 sales
 costs of goods and overall
    financial results;

    
we have identified a material
                                         weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
 and our business and stock
                                         price may be adversely affected if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies
                                         in our internal control over financial reporting;


    
a failure of one or more
                                         of our key IT systems
 networks
 processes
 associated sites or service providers could
                                         have a material adverse impact on our business;


    
the
    possibility that we or our strategic partners will fail to protect our respective trademarks and trade secrets
 which could
    compromise our competitive position and decrease the value of our brand portfolio;

    
the
    possibility that we cannot secure and maintain listings in control states
 which could cause the sales of our products to
    decrease significantly;

    
an
    impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or other acquired intangible assets could negatively affect our operating
    results and shareholders&rsquo; equity;

    
changes
    in consumer preferences and trends could adversely affect demand for our products;

    
there
    is substantial competition in our industry and the many factors that may prevent us from competing successfully;

    
adverse
    changes in public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products;

    
class
    action or other litigation relating to alcohol misuse or abuse could adversely affect our business; and

    
adverse
    regulatory decisions and legal
 regulatory or tax changes could limit our business activities
 increase our operating costs
    and reduce our margins.



    
    



We
assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason
 or to update the reasons actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in
 or implied by
 these forward-looking statements
 even if new information
becomes available in the future.

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
risk

We
are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices
 including movements in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
In the future
 we may enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates
 although we do not currently have any such instruments in place. The following is additional information
about the market risks we are exposed to and how we manage these risks:

Interest
rate risk

Interest
on our Credit Facility (other than with respect to the Purchased Inventory Sublimit) is charged at the rate that
 when annualized
is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 3.00%
 (b) the LIBOR Rate plus 5.50% and (c) 6.00%. The interest rate applicable to
the Purchased Inventory Sublimit is the rate that
 when annualized
 is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 4.25%
 (b) the
LIBOR Rate plus 6.75% and (c) 7.50%. As of March 31
 2018
 we had $18.6 million outstanding under the Credit Facility
 including
$4.8 million under the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 none of which is currently being hedged. Interest on our foreign revolving
credit facilities is charged at the lender&rsquo;s AA1 Rate minus 1.70%. As of March 31
 2018
 we had 0.1 million outstanding
under our foreign revolving credit facilities.

A
hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) increase in the interest rate being charged on the $18.6 million of unhedged
debt outstanding under our Credit Facility
 including the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 and our foreign revolving credit facilities
at March 31
 2018 would have an impact of approximately $157
301 on our interest expense for the year.

Foreign
exchange rate risk

The
majority of our sales
 net and expenses are transacted in U.S. dollars. However
 in the year ended March 31
 2018
 Euro denominated
sales accounted for approximately 6.1% of our sales
 net. We also incur expenses in foreign currencies
 primarily the Euro. In
the year ended March 31
 2018
 Euro denominated expenses accounted for approximately 7.9% of our expenses. A substantial change
in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the Euro could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Euro and British pound would have had an impact of
approximately $607
091 on our income from operations for the year ended March 31
 2018.

If
we do not enter into hedging arrangements
 the more we expand our business outside the United States
 the more our financial results
will be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. In the past
 we have entered into forward contracts from time to time to reduce
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We recognize derivative contracts in the balance sheet at fair value
 and reflect
any net gains and losses currently in earnings. At March 31
 2018 and 2017
 we had no forward contracts outstanding. Gain or loss
on foreign currency forward contracts
 which was de minimis during the periods presented
 is included in other income and expense.

The
functional currencies for our foreign operations are the Euro in Ireland and the British Pound in the United Kingdom. With respect
to our consolidated financial statements
 the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed
for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using
a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income. The effect of foreign currency translation was income of $226
661 for the year ended March 31
 2018
 a loss
of ($114
878) for the year ended March 31
 2017 and income of $92
131 for the year ended March 31
 2016. A hypothetical 10% change
in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Euro and British pound would have had an impact of approximately $280
000 for
the year ended March 31
 2018 as a result of foreign currency translation.

Commodity
price risk

We
currently are not exposed to commodity price risks. We do not purchase the basic ingredients such as grain
 sugar cane or agave
that are converted into alcohol through distillation. Instead
 we have relationships with various companies to provide distillation
bottling or other production services for us. These relationships vary on a brand-by-brand basis.

As
of March 31
 2018
 we did not have any hedging arrangements in place to protect our exposure to commodity price fluctuations.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Castle
Brands Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Castle Brands Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as
of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 comprehensive income
 stockholders&rsquo; equity
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31
 2018
 and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company as of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31
 2018
 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We
also have audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;)
the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31
 2018
 based on criteria established in the Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;)
and our report dated June 14
 2018 expressed an adverse opinion.

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Prior Period Adjustment
The Company
                                         has revised its accumulated deficit and inventory balance at March 31
 2015 to properly
                                         state the historical carrying value of inventory. The Company determined that ending
                                         inventory at March 31
 2015 was overstated by $2
341
648
 which represent the cumulative
                                         impact of errors related to the changes in estimated freight costs
 excise taxes
 certain
                                         cost variances in prior years
 and accounting for intra-company inventory transfers between
                                         different locations. The Company assessed the materiality of these errors on previously
                                         issued consolidated financial statements and concluded that the error was immaterial
                                         to any single or cumulative period. As a result
 inventory was decreased by $2
341
648
                                         and accumulated deficit increased by $2
341
648 at March 31
 2015.


    
    

    

&ndash;
                                         In April 2018
 the Company extended the term of the $20
000
000 11% subordinated note to September
                                         15
 2020 (as described in Note 18). The Company believes that its current cash and working
                                         capital and the availability under the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8C) will enable
                                         it to fund its obligations until it achieves profitability
 ensure continuity of supply
                                         of its brands and support new brand initiatives and marketing programs through at least
                                         June 2019. The Company can continue to meet its operating needs through additional mechanisms
                                         including additional or expanded debt financings
 potential equity offerings and limiting
                                         or adjusting the timing of additional inventory purchases based on available resources.

Equity
    investments
    the investees&rsquo; income
 losses and distributions. The Company assesses the carrying value of its equity investments when
    an indicator of a loss in value is present and records a loss in value of the investment when the assessment indicates that
    an other-than-temporary decline in the investment exists. The Company classifies its equity earnings of equity investments
    as a component of net income or loss.

    
    

    
Trade
    accounts receivable
    allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect anticipated losses on the trade accounts receivable balances. The
    Company calculates this allowance based on its history of write-offs
 level of past due accounts based on contractual terms
    of the receivables and its relationships with and economic status of its customers. For the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017
    and 2016
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for doubtful accounts of $59
012
 $123
200 and $61
000
 respectively.

    
    

    
Revenue
    recognition
    title and risk of loss has passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale (FOB shipping point or FOB destination)
    and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is not recognized on shipments to control states in the United States until
    such time as product is sold through to the retail channel.



    
    





    
Inventories
    
 dry good raw materials (bottles
 labels
 corks and caps)
 packaging
    finished goods
 excise taxes and freight and are valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the weighted average cost method.
    The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete
    or in excess of the Company&rsquo;s forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net
    realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including
 but not limited to
 historical usage
 expected
    future demand and market requirements. A change to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold. See
    Note 3.


During
the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for obsolete and slow-moving inventory
of $376
611
 $240
000 and $200
000
 respectively. The Company recorded these allowances and write-offs on both raw materials
and finished goods
 primarily in connection with spoilage and slow-moving inventory
 label and packaging changes made to certain
brands
 as well as adjustments to estimated freight costs and excise taxes and certain cost variances. The charges have been recorded
as increases to Cost of Sales in the respective years.



    
Equipment
    
 computers and software and furniture and fixtures. When assets are retired or
    otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related depreciation is removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is recognized
    in the statement of operations. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
    the assets ranging from three to five years.

    
    

    
Goodwill
    and other intangible assets
    assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible
    assets with indefinite lives are not amortized
 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances
    indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective
    estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis
 and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.


Under
Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 350
 &ldquo;Intangibles
- Goodwill and Other&rdquo;
 impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable
reporting units with the carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors
to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step
impairment test shall be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results.
Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates
that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth
 cost of sales
 selling and marketing
expenses and discount rates. Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&rsquo;s
net assets exceeds the unit&rsquo;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying
amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount
of goodwill recognized in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid.
Rights
 trademarks
 trade names and formulations are indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization and are tested
for impairment at least annually. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset group allocated
to each reporting unit with its allocated carrying amount.

Under
the goodwill qualitative assessment at March 31
 2018 and 2017
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated
fair value of each reporting unit were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&rsquo; impairment testing results
budget to actual results
 Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based
on this assessment
 the Company determined that no quantitative assessment was required.



    
Impairment
                                         and disposal of long-lived assets
 &ldquo;Accounting for the Impairment
                                         or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&rdquo;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes
                                         have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its definite lived
                                         long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying
                                         amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the
                                         asset. There were no impairments recorded during the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017
                                         and 2016.
        



    
    





    
Shipping
    and handling
    purchase of raw materials and finished goods. These costs are charged to cost of sales at the time the underlying product
    is sold. The Company also incurs shipping costs in connection with its various marketing activities
 including the shipment
    of point of sale materials to the Company&rsquo;s regional sales managers and customers
 and the costs of shipping product
    in connection with its various marketing programs and promotions. These shipping charges are included in selling expense and
    were $2
797
701
 $2
347
121 and $2
635
430 for the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

    
    

    
Excise
    taxes and duty
    paid after finished goods are imported into the United States or other relevant jurisdiction and then transferred out of &ldquo;bond.&rdquo;
    Excise taxes and duty are recorded to inventory as a component of the cost of the underlying finished goods. When the underlying
    products are sold &ldquo;ex warehouse&rdquo;
 the sales price reflects the taxes paid and the inventoried excise taxes and
    duties are charged to cost of sales.

    
    

    
Distributor
    charges and promotional goods
    rendered by the distributor
 including product depletions
 product samples for various promotional purposes
 in-store tastings
    and training where legal
 and local advertising where legal. Such charges are reflected as selling expense as incurred. Also
    the Company has entered into arrangements with certain of its distributors whereby the purchase of a particular product or
    products by a distributor is accompanied by a percentage of the sale being composed of promotional goods or as a predetermined
    discount percentage of dollars off invoice. In such cases
 the cost of the promotional goods is charged to cost of sales and
    dollars off invoice are a reduction to revenue.




    
Foreign
    currency
    in the United Kingdom. Under ASC 830
 &ldquo;Foreign Currency Matters&rdquo;
 the translation from the applicable foreign
    currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date
    and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments
    are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
    shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations.

    
    

    
Fair
    value of financial instruments
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments&rdquo;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument
    as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure
    of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The Company believes that there is no material difference between the
    fair-value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the Company&rsquo;s balance sheets due to the short-term maturity
    of these instruments
 or with respect to the Company&rsquo;s debt
 as compared to the current borrowing rates available to
    the Company.


The
Company&rsquo;s investments are reported at fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance
 which accomplishes the following
key objectives:



    
    
Defines
    fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date;

    
    
Establishes
    a three-level hierarchy (&ldquo;valuation hierarchy&rdquo;) for fair value measurements;

    
    
Requires
    consideration of the Company&rsquo;s creditworthiness when valuing liabilities; and

    
    
Expands
    disclosures about instruments measured at fair value.


The
valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
A financial instrument&rsquo;s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are as follows:



    
    
Level
    1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

    
    
Level
    2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and inputs
    that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Income
    taxes
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &ldquo;2017 Tax Act&rdquo;) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes
    a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company
 most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income
    tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31
 2017 and the recognition of tax net operating
    loss carryfowards. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration
    of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27
 2017 as well as prospective changes beginning in
    2018
 including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction
 acceleration of tax revenue recognition
 capitalization of
    research and development expenditures
 additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility
    of interest.



    
    


The
Company recognized the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in its current financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 118
 which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo;
 (&ldquo;ASC
740&rdquo;) in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. As such
 the Company&rsquo;s financial results
reflect the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. The Company did not identify
items for which the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act have not been completed and a reasonable estimate could not be determined
as of March 31
 2018.

The
2017 Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% for all corporations effective January 1
 2018. For
fiscal year companies
 the change in law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the fiscal year
 which
in the Company&rsquo;s case is 30.79% for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. Thereafter
 the applicable statutory rate
is 21.0%.


to reflect the effects of the 2017 Tax Act in the period in which the 2017 Tax Act was enacted. Accordingly
 the
Company reduced the statutory rate that applies to its year-to-date fiscal 2018 earnings from 34.0% to 30.79%. In addition
the Company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new rate. The combined result of the 2017 Tax Act
resulted in a tax benefit of $40
485 during the three months ended December 31
 2017.

Under
ASC 740
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation allowance
is provided to the extent a deferred tax asset is not considered recoverable.


of ASC 740 and as of March 31
 2018
 the Company had reserves for uncertain tax positions (including related interest and
penalties) for various state and local tax issues of $6
778. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain
tax positions in general and administrative expense.

Use
    of estimates
    (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates
    include the accounting for items such as evaluating annual impairment tests
 derivative instruments and equity issuances
    warrant valuation
 stock-based compensation
 allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 amortization
    and expense accruals.

                                         which allows for stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting
                                         from the 2017 Tax Act to be reclassified to retained earnings. This guidance is

 the FASB issued
ASU No. 2017-01
 &ldquo;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&rdquo; This ASU
 which must
be applied prospectively
 provides a narrower framework to be used to determine if a set of assets and activities constitutes
a business than under current guidance and is generally expected to result in greater consistency in the application of ASC Topic
805
 Business Combinations. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The
Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on
the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-18
 &ldquo;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
 a consensus of the FASB&rsquo;s Emerging Issues
Task Force (the &ldquo;Task Force&rdquo;).&rdquo; The new standard requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change
during the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash
equivalents. Entities will also be required to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of
the restrictions. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The Company
has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s
results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

In
October 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-16
 &ldquo;Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.&rdquo;
This ASU removes the prohibition against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity
transfers of assets other than inventory. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption
permitted. Entities must apply a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of
the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of
this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-15
 &ldquo;Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments&rdquo;
 which provides
guidance on eight cash flow classification issues with the objective of reducing differences in practice. The new standard is
effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. Adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis
unless impracticable for any of the amendments
 in which case a prospective application is permitted. The Company has evaluated
the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s
results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-08
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross
versus Net) (&ldquo;ASU 2016-08&rdquo;). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&ldquo;ASU 2014-9&rdquo;)
 instead
 the amendments in this ASU are intended
to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether
an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as
the new revenue standard issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new revenue standard outlines a
new
 single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes
most current revenue recognition guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new revenue standard contains principles
to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions
to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control
of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. In addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for the Company as
of April 1
 2018. The Company expects to transition to ASU 2016-08 using the Modified-Retrospective Method
 under which
the prior years&rsquo; data is not recast; instead
 a single adjustment is made to equity at the beginning of the initial year
of application. The Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not
have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 &ldquo;Leases.&rdquo; The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that
requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in
the income statement. The new standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2019. A modified retrospective transition approach
is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented in the financial statements
 with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating
the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-01
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities&rdquo;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes
to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Also
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation
allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.
The new standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 and upon adoption
 an entity should apply the amendments by
means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance
is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities
under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company has evaluated
the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s
results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding
during the period that are not anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon exercise
of stock options
 vesting of restricted shares or conversion of convertible notes outstanding. In computing diluted net income
per share for the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 no adjustment has been made to the weighted average outstanding common
shares for the assumed conversion of convertible notes as assumed conversion of these securities is anti-dilutive.

Investment
in Gosling-Castle Partners Inc.
 consolidated

In
March 2017
 the Company acquired an additional 201
000 shares (the &ldquo;GCP Share Acquisition&rdquo;) of the common stock of
GCP
 representing a 20.1% equity interest in GCP. GCP is a strategic global export venture between the Company and the Gosling
family. As a result of the completion of the GCP Share Acquisition
 the Company&rsquo;s total equity interest in GCP increased
to 80.1%. The consideration for the GCP Share Acquisition was (i) $20
000
000 in cash and (ii) 1
800
000 shares of common stock
of the Company.

The
Company accounted for this transaction in accordance with ASC 810 &ldquo;Consolidation
&rdquo; and in particular section 810-10-45.
Under the relevant guidance
 a parent accounts for such changes in its ownership interest in a subsidiary as equity transactions.
The parent cannot recognize a gain or loss in consolidated net income or comprehensive income for such transactions and is not
permitted to step up a portion of the subsidiary&rsquo;s net assets to fair value for the additional interests acquired. Any difference
between the fair value of the consideration paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted shall be recognized
in equity attributable to the parent. As a result
 the Company reduced the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest by $2
232
824
with the $20
215
176 excess of the cash and stock paid over the adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest
recognized as a decrease in the Company&rsquo;s additional paid-in capital.


 2018
 2017 and
2016
 GCP had pretax net income on a stand-alone basis of $5
613
355
 $3
762
130 and $3
475

 respectively. The Company
allocated a portion of this net income
 or $1

 $1
359
145 and $809
662
 to non-controlling interest for the years ended
March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The cumulative balance allocated to noncontrolling interests in GCP was $3
568
636
and $2
479
512 at March 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 as shown on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

In
September 2015
 GCP declared and paid a $1
500
000 cash dividend to its shareholders. The Company recorded 60% of this dividend
or $900
000
 as a return of capital and a reduction of its investment in GCP
 and allocated 40% of this dividend
 or $600
000
to noncontrolling interests and a reduction in the additional paid-in capital of GCP. GCP did not pay a dividend in the years
ended March 31
 2018 and 2017.

The
Company enters into forward contracts from time to time to reduce its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company recognizes
in the balance sheet derivative contracts at fair value
 and reflects any net gains and losses currently in earnings. At March

 which
was de minimis during the periods presented
 is included in other income and expense.

NOTE

The
Company accounts for taxes in accordance with ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo;
 which requires the recognition of tax benefits
or expense on the temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences
are expected to be recovered or settled.

The
Company&rsquo;s income tax expense for the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016 consists primarily of federal and state and
local taxes. Effective with the acquisition of the additional 20.1% of GCP as described in Note 4

tax assets
 management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in
those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. The Company
considers the level of historical taxable income
 scheduled reversal of temporary differences
 tax planning strategies and projected
future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted. Based on historic operating losses and projected
future income
 the Company concluded that its net deferred tax assets are not realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. As such
the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. The Company&rsquo;s valuation allowance
decreased by $11
280
000 during fiscal 2018 primarily related to the remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and
liabilities at the reduced federal corporate tax rate of 21% enacted with the 2017 Tax Act.

In
accordance with ASC 350-10
 the Company does not amortize indefinite lived-intangible assets for financial reporting purposes.
The deferred tax liability of $485
000 relates to the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis
of intangible assets.


 2018
 the Company had U.S.
federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $80
818
000 for U.S. tax purposes
 which expire in fiscal 2023
through 2036
 if not utilized. The annual utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in future years due
to the &ldquo;change in ownership provisions&rdquo; set forth in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has
Irish net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14
205
000
 which have an indefinite life.

As
of March 31
 2018
 the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and foreign withholding taxes on any excess of financial reporting
over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries
 as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested overseas. Generally
 such
amounts become subject to U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. Due to the complexities
of the tax laws and assumptions that would have to be made
 it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income tax provisions
that may be required.

A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits
 excluding interest and penalties
 is as follows:

2018
 the entire amount would reduce the Company&rsquo;s effective tax rate if recognized. The Company records accrued
interest and penalties related to income tax matters in general and administrative expenses. For the year ended March 31
 2018
and 2017
 interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits were $1
000 and $2
000
 respectively. The Company does not believe
that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

Tax
years 2014 through 2018 remain open to examination by federal and state tax jurisdictions. The Company has various foreign subsidiaries
for which tax years 2012 through 2018 remain open to examination in certain foreign tax jurisdictions.

The
fair value of each option award under the 2003 and 2013 Plans was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The use of an option pricing model
also requires the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility
 risk-free interest rate
 expected dividends
and expected term. Expected volatility is based on the Company&rsquo;s historical volatility and the volatility of a peer group
of companies over the expected life of the option. The expected term and vesting of the options represents the estimated period
of time until exercise. The expected term was determined using the simplified method available under current guidance. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option. The
Company has not paid dividends on its common stock in the past and does not plan to pay any dividends on its common stock in the
near future. Current authoritative guidance also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise
these estimates
 if necessary
 in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company estimates
forfeitures based on its expectation of future experience while considering its historical experience.

The
fair value of options at grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model utilizing the following weighted
average assumptions:

The
                                         Company entered into a supply agreement with a bourbon distiller
 which provided for
                                         the production of newly-distilled bourbon whiskey through December 31
 2019. Under this
                                         agreement
 the distiller was to provide the Company with an agreed upon amount of original
                                         proof gallons of newly distilled bourbon whiskey
 subject to certain annual adjustments.
                                         For the contract year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company contracted and purchased approximately
                                         $2
053
750 in newly distilled bourbon. For the contract year ended December 31
 2017
                                         the Company originally contracted to purchase approximately $2
464
500 in newly distilled
                                         bourbon
 $1
959
801 of which had been purchased as of December 31
 2017. The Company
                                         is not obligated to pay the distiller for any product not yet received. During the term
                                         of this supply agreement
 the distiller had the right to limit additional purchases to
                                         ten percent above the commitment amount. In March 2017
 the distiller notified the Company
                                         of its intent to terminate the contract under its terms after the 2017 contract year
                                         and to limit the purchase amount for the 2017 contract year to no more than the 2016
                                         contract year amount.
        
In
        October 2017
 the Company entered into a new supply agreement with a different bourbon distiller. Under this agreement
        the distiller will provide the Company with an agreed upon amount of original proof gallons of newly-distilled bourbon
        whiskey
 subject to certain annual adjustments. For the contract year ending December 31
 2018
 the Company has contracted
        to purchase approximately $3
900
000 in newly distilled bourbon
 none of which had been purchased as of March 31
 2018.
        The Company is not obligated to pay the distiller for any product not yet received.

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure



Item
9A. Controls and Procedures

(a)


The
Company has established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
 is recorded
processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and
 as such
 is accumulated and communicated to the Company&rsquo;s management
 including our Chief Executive Officer (&ldquo;CEO&rdquo;)
and Chief Financial Officer (&ldquo;CFO&rdquo;)
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
together with our CEO and CFO
 evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act
 as of March 31
 2018. Based on their evaluation
 the CEO and CFO concluded that
 due to
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below
 our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of March 31
 2018. In light of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting
 we analyzed
the underlying data used in reconciling inventory transfers between domestic and foreign locations
 prior to filing this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

These
additional procedures have allowed us to conclude that
 notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting
 the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report fairly present
 in all material respects
 the Company&rsquo;s
financial position
 results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

(b)


The
Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including the CEO and CFO
 we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31
 2018 based upon Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;).

A
material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


 2018
we did not maintain effective internal controls over the recording of inventory transfers between domestic and foreign
locations because certain internal controls over the reconciliation of the inventory transfer account were not operating effectively.


the underlying deficiencies are not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements reported in any interim or annual
period and therefore
 did not result in a revision to previously filed Consolidated Financial Statements. However
 these
control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim Consolidated Financial Statements
that would not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. Accordingly
 we have determined that these control deficiencies
constitute a material weakness.



Because
of this material weakness
 management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 based on criteria described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

The
independent registered public accounting firm
 EisnerAmper LLP
 has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the
Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31
 2018
 which is included in this Form 10-K in Item 8
&ldquo;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&rdquo;

(c)



of the material weaknesses
 management implemented a remediation plan to address the control deficiencies underlying
the material weaknesses. The remediation plan includes:

&#9679;
Implementing specific reconciliation and review procedures on a quarterly as well as annual basis designed to ensure
inventory is being accurately costed.

Management
has had the foregoing reconciliation and review procedures regarding the allocation of excise taxes and freight costs to inventory
in place and operating since the first quarter of the Company&rsquo;s fiscal year ending March 31
 2018. Management believes that
such enhanced control has been operating effectively in the fiscal year ending March 31
 2018.

Management
plans to have its enhanced review procedures over reconciling inventory transfers between domestic and foreign locations
in place and operating in the second quarter of the Company&rsquo;s fiscal year ending March 31
 2019. Management intends to remediate
this material weakness by March 31
 2019
 assuming the Company has sufficient opportunities to conclude
 through testing
 that
the enhanced control is operating effectively.


(d)


Other
than the changes described above
here have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected
 or is
reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.



    
    




(d)


To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Castle
Brands Inc.

Opinion
on the Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We
have audited Castle Brands Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) internal control over financial reporting as of March
31
 2018
 based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;). In our opinion
 because of the effect of the material weakness
described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria
 Castle Brands Inc. and Subsidiaries
has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31
 2018
 based on criteria established in
the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

A
material weakness is a control deficiency
 or combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management&rsquo;s
assessment. The material weakness related to controls over reconciling inventory transfers between domestic and foreign locations.
This material weakness was considered in determining the nature
 timing
 and extent of the audit tests applied in our audit of
the March 31
 2018 financial statements
 and this report does not affect our report dated June 14
 2017
 on those financial statements.

We
also have audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;)
the consolidated balance sheets of Castle Brands Inc. and Subsidiaries as of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the related consolidated
statements of operations
 comprehensive income
 stockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended March 31
 2018
 and the related notes and our report dated June 14
 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Basis
for Opinion 

The
Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
 included in the accompanying Management&rsquo;s Annual Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition
and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

An
entity&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. An entity&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the entity; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the
entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the entity&rsquo;s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 the cost and related depreciation is removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations.

Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized
 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis

 &amp;#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other&amp;#8221;
&#13;impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with the&#13;carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it&#13;is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step impairment test shall&#13;be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes in estimates&#13;or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates that most significantly&#13;affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth
 cost of sales
 selling and marketing expenses and discount rates.&#13;Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s net assets exceeds the&#13;unit&amp;#8217;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over&#13;its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized&#13;in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid.

 2018 and 2017
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit&#13;were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&amp;#8217; impairment testing results

 Company-specific&#13;facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based on this assessment

 &amp;#8220;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&amp;#8221;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments recorded during the years ended March 31

When the underlying products are sold &amp;#8220;ex warehouse&amp;#8221;

 including product depletions
 product samples for various promotional purposes
 in-store tastings and training where legal
 and local advertising where legal. Such charges are reflected as selling expense as incurred. Also
 the Company has entered into arrangements with certain of its distributors whereby the purchase of a particular product or products by a distributor is accompanied by a percentage of the sale being composed of promotional goods or as a predetermined discount percentage of dollars off invoice. In such cases

 &amp;#8220;Foreign Currency Matters&amp;#8221;
 the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;tr style=vertical-align: top&gt;&#13;    &lt;td&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;tr style=vertical-align: top&gt;&#13;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt&gt;R.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fair value of financial instruments&lt;/u&gt; - ASC 825
 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments&amp;#8221;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The Company believes that there is no material difference between the fair-value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the Company&amp;#8217;s balance sheets due to the short-term maturity of these instruments
 or with respect to the Company&amp;#8217;s debt



 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &amp;#8220;2017 Tax Act&amp;#8221;) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company
 most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31
 2017 and the recognition of tax net operating loss carryfowards. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27
 2017 as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018
 including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction
 acceleration of tax revenue recognition
 capitalization of research and development expenditures

 which&#13;provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740
 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes&amp;#8221;
 (&amp;#8220;ASC 740&amp;#8221;) in the reporting&#13;period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. As such
 the Company&amp;#8217;s financial results reflect the income tax effects&#13;of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. The Company did not identify items for which the income&#13;tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act have not been completed and a reasonable estimate could not be determined as of March 31

 2018. For fiscal year companies
 the change&#13;in law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the fiscal year

 2018. Thereafter

 the Company reduced the&#13;statutory rate that applies to its year-to-date fiscal 2018 earnings from 34.0% to 30.79%. In addition
 the Company remeasured&#13;its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new rate. The combined result of the 2017 Tax Act resulted in a tax benefit&#13;of $40

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2017-01
 &amp;#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&amp;#8221; This ASU
 which must&#13;be applied prospectively
 provides a narrower framework to be used to determine if a set of assets and activities constitutes a&#13;business than under current guidance and is generally expected to result in greater consistency in the application of ASC Topic&#13;805
 Business Combinations. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The&#13;Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on&#13;the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2016-18
 &amp;#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
 a consensus of the FASB&amp;#8217;s Emerging Issues Task&#13;Force (the &amp;#8220;Task Force&amp;#8221;).&amp;#8221; The new standard requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during&#13;the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.&#13;Entities will also be required to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of the restrictions.&#13;This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The Company has evaluated the new&#13;guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of&#13;operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2016-16
 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.&amp;#8221; This ASU removes the prohibition&#13;against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than&#13;inventory. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. Entities must apply a&#13;modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.&#13;The Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact&#13;on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2016-15
 &amp;#8220;Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments&amp;#8221;
 which provides&#13;guidance on eight cash flow classification issues with the objective of reducing differences in practice. The new standard is effective&#13;for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. Adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis
 unless&#13;impracticable for any of the amendments
 in which case a prospective application is permitted. The Company has evaluated the new&#13;guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of&#13;operations

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2016-08
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus&#13;Net) (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-08&amp;#8221;). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09
 Revenue&#13;from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&amp;#8220;ASU 2014-9&amp;#8221;)
 instead
 the amendments in this ASU are intended to improve&#13;the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity&#13;reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue&#13;standard issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new revenue standard outlines a new
 single comprehensive&#13;model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition&#13;guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new revenue standard contains principles to determine the measurement of revenue&#13;and timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue&#13;is recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services&#13;in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.&#13;In addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue&#13;and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company&#13;expects to transition to ASU 2016-08 using the Modified-Retrospective Method
 under which the prior years&amp;#8217; data is not recast;&#13;instead
 a single adjustment is made to equity at the beginning of the initial year of application. The Company has evaluated the&#13;new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s results&#13;of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2016-02
 &amp;#8220;Leases.&amp;#8221; The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU&#13;asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as&#13;either finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new&#13;standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2019. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees&#13;for capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented&#13;in the financial statements
 with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance&#13;to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2016-01
 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial&#13;Liabilities&amp;#8221;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes&#13;to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
&#13;and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Also
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation&#13;allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.&#13;The new standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 and upon adoption
 an entity should apply the amendments by&#13;means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance&#13;is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under&#13;the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company has evaluated the&#13;new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s results&#13;of operations

 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12
 &amp;#8220;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to&#13;        Accounting for Hedging Activities&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2017-12&amp;#8221;)
 which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships&#13;        to better portray the economic results of an entity&amp;#8217;s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain&#13;        targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update&#13;        is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance&#13;        in the current period and determined that its adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results&#13;        of operations

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
&#13;        &amp;#8220;Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
&amp;#8221; which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee&#13;        share-based payment transactions
 including the accounting for income taxes and statutory tax withholding requirements
 as well&#13;        as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance became effective for the Company beginning April 1
 2017. The Company&#13;        determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
&#13;        &amp;#8220;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&amp;#8221; which changes the measurement principle for inventory&#13;        from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling&#13;        prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new&#13;        guidance has been applied on a prospective basis and became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2017. The Company determined&#13;        that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the Company acquired&#13;an additional 201
000 shares (the &amp;#8220;GCP Share Acquisition&amp;#8221;) of the common stock of GCP
 representing a 20.1% equity&#13;interest in GCP. GCP is a strategic global export venture between the Company and the Gosling family. As a result of the completion&#13;of the GCP Share Acquisition
 the Company&amp;#8217;s total equity interest in GCP increased to 80.1%. The consideration for the GCP&#13;Share Acquisition was (i) $20

&amp;#8221; and in particular section 810-10-45. Under the relevant guidance
 a parent&#13;accounts for such changes in its ownership interest in a subsidiary as equity transactions. The parent cannot recognize a gain&#13;or loss in consolidated net income or comprehensive income for such transactions and is not permitted to step up a portion of the&#13;subsidiary&amp;#8217;s net assets to fair value for the additional interests acquired. Any difference between the fair value of the&#13;consideration paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted shall be recognized in equity attributable to&#13;the parent. As a result
 the Company reduced the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest by $2

 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis

 &amp;#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and&#13;Other&amp;#8221;
 impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting&#13;units with the carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine&#13;whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step impairment&#13;test shall be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes&#13;in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates that most&#13;significantly affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth
 cost of sales
 selling and marketing expenses and&#13;discount rates. Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s net assets&#13;exceeds the unit&amp;#8217;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of&#13;goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill&#13;recognized in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid. Rights

 2018 and 2017
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of each reporting&#13;unit were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&amp;#8217; impairment testing results
 budget to actual results
&#13;Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based on this assessment


 &amp;#8220;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&amp;#8221;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments recorded during the years ended March 31

 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments&amp;#8221;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments.

 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &amp;#8220;2017 Tax Act&amp;#8221;) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company
 most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31
 2017 and the recognition of tax net operating loss carryfowards. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27
 2017 as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018
 including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction
 acceleration of tax revenue recognition

 (&amp;#8220;ASC 740&amp;#8221;) in&#13;the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. As such
 the Company&amp;#8217;s financial results reflect the&#13;income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. The Company did not identify items for&#13;which the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act have not been completed and a reasonable estimate could not be determined as of&#13;March 31

 2018. For fiscal year companies
&#13;the change in law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the fiscal year

 2018. Thereafter

&#13;the Company reduced the statutory rate that applies to its year-to-date&amp;#160;fiscal 2018&amp;#160;earnings from 34.0% to 30.79%. In&#13;addition
 the Company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new rate. The combined result of the 2017&#13;Tax Act resulted in a tax benefit of $40

&#13;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&amp;#8220;ASU 2014-9&amp;#8221;)
 instead
 the amendments in this ASU are intended&#13;to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether&#13;an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as&#13;the new revenue standard issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new revenue standard outlines a new
&#13;single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most&#13;current revenue recognition guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new revenue standard contains principles to determine&#13;the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine&#13;when and how revenue is recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised&#13;goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those&#13;goods or services. In addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty&#13;of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018.&#13;The Company expects to transition to&amp;#160;ASU 2016-08&amp;#160;using the Modified-Retrospective Method
 under which the prior years&amp;#8217;&#13;data is not recast; instead
 a single adjustment is made to equity at the beginning of the initial year of&amp;#160;application. The&#13;Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on&#13;the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB&#13;issued ASU 2016-02
 &amp;#8220;Leases.&amp;#8221; The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record&#13;a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified&#13;as either finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new&#13;standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2019. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees&#13;for capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented&#13;in the financial statements
 with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance&#13;to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB&#13;issued ASU 2016-01
 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and&#13;Financial Liabilities&amp;#8221;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.&#13;Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value&#13;option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Also
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to&#13;the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale&#13;debt securities. The new standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 and upon adoption
 an entity should apply the&#13;amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which&#13;the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial&#13;liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income.&amp;#160;The&#13;Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on&#13;the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12
 &amp;#8220;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements&#13;        to Accounting for Hedging Activities&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2017-12&amp;#8221;)
 which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships&#13;        to better portray the economic results of an entity&amp;#8217;s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain&#13;        targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update&#13;        is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance&#13;        in the current period and determined that its adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results&#13;        of operations

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
&#13;        &amp;#8220;Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
&amp;#8221; which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee&#13;        share-based payment transactions
 including the accounting for income taxes and statutory tax withholding requirements
 as well&#13;        as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance became effective for the Company beginning April 1
 2017. The Company&#13;        determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
&#13;        &amp;#8220;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&amp;#8221; which changes the measurement principle for inventory&#13;        from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling&#13;        prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new&#13;        guidance has been applied on a prospective basis and became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2017. The Company determined&#13;        that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 are convertible in whole or in part from time to time at the option of the holders thereof into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at a conversion price of $0.90 per share (the &#8220;Conversion Price&#8221;). The Convertible Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium
 but with payment of accrued interest to the date of prepayment. The Convertible Notes contain customary events of default

000 per trading day and (ii) the volume weighted average price of the common stock for at least twenty (20) trading days during any thirty (30) consecutive trading day period exceeds 250% of the then-current Conversion Price. Any forced conversion will be applied ratably to the holders of all Convertible Notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement based on each holder&#8217;s then-current note holdings. In connection with the Note Purchase Agreement
 each purchaser of the Convertible Notes was required to execute a joinder to the subordination agreement
 by and among ACF and certain other junior lenders to the Company; the Company is not a party to the subordination agreement. During the year ended March 31

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES



    
 - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Castle Brands Inc. (&#8220;the Company&#8221;)
 its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries
 Castle Brands (USA) Corp. (&#8220;CB-USA&#8221;) and McLain &#38; Kyne
 Ltd. (&#8220;McLain &#38; Kyne&#8221;)
 the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries
 Castle Brands Spirits Group Limited (&#8220;CB-IRL&#8221;) and Castle Brands Spirits Marketing and Sales Company Limited
 and the Company&#8217;s 80.1% ownership interest in Gosling-Castle Partners Inc. (&#8220;GCP&#8221;)
 with adjustments for income or loss allocated based upon percentage of ownership. The accounts of the subsidiaries have been included as of the date of acquisition. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

    
    

    
    
 - The Company
        is principally engaged in the importation
 marketing and sale of premium and super premium rums
 whiskey
 liqueurs
 vodka and related
        non-alcoholic beverage products in the United States
 Canada
 Europe and Asia.
        

    
- The Company has revised its accumulated deficit and inventory balance at March 31
 2015 to properly state the historical carrying value of inventory. The Company determined that ending inventory at March 31
 2015 was overstated by $2
341
648
 which represent the cumulative impact of errors related to the changes in estimated freight costs
 excise taxes
 certain cost variances in prior years
 and accounting for intra-company inventory transfers between different locations. The Company assessed the materiality of these errors on previously issued consolidated financial statements and concluded that the error was immaterial to any single or cumulative period. As a result
 inventory was decreased by $2
341
648 and accumulated deficit increased by $2
341
648 at March 31
 2015.

    
    

    
 &#8211; In April 2018
 the Company extended the term of the $20
000
000 11% subordinated note to September 15
 2020 (as described in Note 18). The Company believes that its current cash and working capital and the availability under the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8C) will enable it to fund its obligations until it achieves profitability
 ensure continuity of supply of its brands and support new brand initiatives and marketing programs through at least June 2019. The Company can continue to meet its operating needs through additional mechanisms including additional or expanded debt financings
 potential equity offerings and limiting or adjusting the timing of additional inventory purchases based on available resources.

 - Equity investments are carried at original cost adjusted for the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the investees&#8217; income
 losses and distributions. The Company assesses the carrying value of its equity investments when an indicator of a loss in value is present and records a loss in value of the investment when the assessment indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in the investment exists. The Company classifies its equity earnings of equity investments as a component of net income or loss.

    
    

    
 - The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect anticipated losses on the trade accounts receivable balances. The Company calculates this allowance based on its history of write-offs
 level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and its relationships with and economic status of its customers. For the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for doubtful accounts of $59
012
 $123
200 and $61
000
 respectively.

    
    

    
 &#8211; Revenue from product sales is recognized when the product is shipped to a customer (generally a distributor)
 title and risk of loss has passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale (FOB shipping point or FOB destination)
 and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is not recognized on shipments to control states in the United States until such time as product is sold through to the retail channel.




    
- Inventories are comprised of distilled spirits
 dry good raw materials (bottles
 labels
 corks and caps)
 packaging
 finished goods
 excise taxes and freight and are valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the weighted average cost method. The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Company&#8217;s forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including
 but not limited to
 historical usage
 expected future demand and market requirements. A change to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold. See Note 3.



2018
 2017 and 2016
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for obsolete and slow-moving inventory of $376
611
 $240
000
and $200
000
 respectively. The Company recorded these allowances and write-offs on both raw materials and finished goods
 primarily
in connection with spoilage and slow-moving inventory
 label and packaging changes made to certain brands
 as well as adjustments
to estimated freight costs and excise taxes and certain cost variances. The charges have been recorded as increases to Cost of
Sales in the respective years.



    
- Equipment consists of office equipment
 computers and software and furniture and fixtures. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related depreciation is removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to five years.

    
    

    
 - Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price including related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized
 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis
 and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.



Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 350
 &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other&#8221;
impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with the
carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it
is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step impairment test shall
be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes in estimates
or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates that most significantly
affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth
 cost of sales
 selling and marketing expenses and discount rates.
Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#8217;s net assets exceeds the
unit&#8217;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over
its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized
in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid. Rights
 trademarks
 trade
names and formulations are indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment at least
annually. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset group allocated to each reporting unit with
its allocated carrying amount.


at March 31
 2018 and 2017
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit
were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&#8217; impairment testing results
 budget to actual results
 Company-specific
facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based on this assessment
 the Company determined
that no quantitative assessment was required.



    
 - Under ASC 310
 &#8220;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&#8221;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments recorded during the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016.




    
 - The Company reflects as inventory costs freight-in and related external handling charges relating to the purchase of raw materials and finished goods. These costs are charged to cost of sales at the time the underlying product is sold. The Company also incurs shipping costs in connection with its various marketing activities
 including the shipment of point of sale materials to the Company&#8217;s regional sales managers and customers
 and the costs of shipping product in connection with its various marketing programs and promotions. These shipping charges are included in selling expense and were $2
797
701
 $2
347
121 and $2
635
430 for the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

    
    

    
 - Excise taxes and duty are computed at standard rates based on alcohol proof per gallon/liter and are paid after finished goods are imported into the United States or other relevant jurisdiction and then transferred out of &#8220;bond.&#8221; Excise taxes and duty are recorded to inventory as a component of the cost of the underlying finished goods. When the underlying products are sold &#8220;ex warehouse&#8221;
 the sales price reflects the taxes paid and the inventoried excise taxes and duties are charged to cost of sales.

    
    

    
 - The Company incurs charges from its distributors for a variety of transactions and services rendered by the distributor
 including product depletions
 product samples for various promotional purposes
 in-store tastings and training where legal
 and local advertising where legal. Such charges are reflected as selling expense as incurred. Also
 the Company has entered into arrangements with certain of its distributors whereby the purchase of a particular product or products by a distributor is accompanied by a percentage of the sale being composed of promotional goods or as a predetermined discount percentage of dollars off invoice. In such cases
 the cost of the promotional goods is charged to cost of sales and dollars off invoice are a reduction to revenue.




    
 - The functional currency for the Company&#8217;s foreign operations is the Euro in Ireland and the British Pound in the United Kingdom. Under ASC 830
 &#8220;Foreign Currency Matters&#8221;
 the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations.

    
    

    
 - ASC 825
 &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The Company believes that there is no material difference between the fair-value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the Company&#8217;s balance sheets due to the short-term maturity of these instruments
 or with respect to the Company&#8217;s debt
 as compared to the current borrowing rates available to the Company.



are reported at fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance
 which accomplishes the following key objectives:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    



upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument&#8217;s
categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are as follows:



    
    
    

    
    
Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and inputs that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

    
    
    




    
 - In December 2017
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;2017 Tax Act&#8221;) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company
 most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31
 2017 and the recognition of tax net operating loss carryfowards. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27
 2017 as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018
 including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction
 acceleration of tax revenue recognition
 capitalization of research and development expenditures
 additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.

provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221;
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;) in the reporting
period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. As such
 the Company&#8217;s financial results reflect the income tax effects
of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. The Company did not identify items for which the income

 2018.


federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% for all corporations effective January 1
 2018. For fiscal year companies
 the change
in law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the fiscal year

 the Company reduced the
statutory rate that applies to its year-to-date fiscal 2018 earnings from 34.0% to 30.79%. In addition
 the Company remeasured
its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new rate. The combined result of the 2017 Tax Act resulted in a tax benefit
of $40
485 during the three months ended December 31
 2017.


 deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation allowance is provided to the extent a deferred
tax asset is not considered recoverable.


of ASC 740 and as of March 31
 2018
 the Company had reserves for uncertain tax positions (including related interest and penalties)
for various state and local tax issues of $6
778. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions
in general and administrative expense.



    
 - The costs of research
 development and product improvement are charged to expense as incurred and are included in selling expense.

    
    

    
- Advertising and marketing costs are expensed when the advertising first appears in its respective medium. Advertising expense
 which is included in selling expense
 was $5

523
 $4
486
796 and $4
960
301 for the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

    
    

    
 - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates include the accounting for items such as evaluating annual impairment tests
 derivative instruments and equity issuances
 warrant valuation
 stock-based compensation
 allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 amortization and expense accruals.

 instead
 the amendments in this ASU are intended to improve
the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity
reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue
standard issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new revenue standard outlines a new
 single comprehensive
model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition
guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new revenue standard contains principles to determine the measurement of revenue
and timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue
is recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
In addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company
expects to transition to ASU 2016-08 using the Modified-Retrospective Method
 under which the prior years&#8217; data is not recast;
instead
 a single adjustment is made to equity at the beginning of the initial year of application. The Company has evaluated the
new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results
of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-02
 &#8220;Leases.&#8221; The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU
asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as
either finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new
standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2019. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees
for capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented
in the financial statements
 with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance
to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-01
 &#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities&#8221;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes
to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Also
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation
allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.
The new standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 and upon adoption
 an entity should apply the amendments by
means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance
is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under
the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company has evaluated the
new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results
of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

 - In August
        2017
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12
 &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to
        Accounting for Hedging Activities&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2017-12&#8221;)
 which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships
        to better portray the economic results of an entity&#8217;s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain
        targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update
        is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance
        in the current period and determined that its adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results
        of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.
        

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
        &#8220;Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
&#8221; which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee
        share-based payment transactions
 including the accounting for income taxes and statutory tax withholding requirements
 as well
        as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance became effective for the Company beginning April 1
 2017. The Company
        determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash
        flows and financial condition.
        

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
        &#8220;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&#8221; which changes the measurement principle for inventory
        from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling
        prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new
        guidance has been applied on a prospective basis and became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2017. The Company determined
        that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and
        financial condition.

BASIC AND DILUTED
NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE


by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common
share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period that are not
anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon exercise of stock options
 vesting
of restricted shares or conversion of convertible notes outstanding. In computing diluted net income per share for the years ended
March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 no adjustment has been made to the weighted average outstanding common shares for the assumed conversion
of convertible notes as assumed conversion of these securities is anti-dilutive.

Investments
 Debt and Equity Securities [Abstract]








Investment in Gosling-Castle Partners
Inc.
 consolidated


 the Company acquired
an additional 201
000 shares (the &#8220;GCP Share Acquisition&#8221;) of the common stock of GCP
 representing a 20.1% equity
interest in GCP. GCP is a strategic global export venture between the Company and the Gosling family. As a result of the completion
of the GCP Share Acquisition
 the Company&#8217;s total equity interest in GCP increased to 80.1%. The consideration for the GCP
Share Acquisition was (i) $20
000
000 in cash and (ii) 1
800
000 shares of common stock of the Company.


in accordance with ASC 810 &#8220;Consolidation
&#8221; and in particular section 810-10-45. Under the relevant guidance
 a parent
accounts for such changes in its ownership interest in a subsidiary as equity transactions. The parent cannot recognize a gain
or loss in consolidated net income or comprehensive income for such transactions and is not permitted to step up a portion of the
subsidiary&#8217;s net assets to fair value for the additional interests acquired. Any difference between the fair value of the
consideration paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted shall be recognized in equity attributable to
the parent. As a result
 the Company reduced the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest by $2
232
824
 with the $20
215
176
excess of the cash and stock paid over the adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest recognized as a decrease
in the Company&#8217;s additional paid-in capital.


 2018
2017 and 2016
 GCP had pretax net income on a stand-alone basis of&#160;$5
613
355
 $3
762
130 and $3
475
006
 respectively. The
Company allocated a portion of this net income
 or $1
104
608
 $1
359
145 and $809
662
 to non-controlling interest for the years
ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The cumulative balance allocated to noncontrolling interests in GCP was $3
568
636
and $2
479
512 at March 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 as shown on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.


 GCP declared and
paid a $1
500
000 cash dividend to its shareholders. The Company recorded 60% of this dividend
 or $900
000
 as a return of capital
and a reduction of its investment in GCP
 and allocated 40% of this dividend
 or $600
000
 to noncontrolling interests and a reduction
in the additional paid-in capital of GCP. GCP did not pay a dividend in the years ended March 31
 2018 and 2017.

tax assets
&#160;management&#160;considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in
those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. The Company
considers the level of historical taxable income
 scheduled reversal of temporary differences
 tax planning strategies and projected
future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted. Based on historic operating losses and projected
future income
 the Company concluded that its net deferred tax assets are not realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. As such
the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. The Company&#8217;s valuation allowance
decreased by&#160;$11
280
000&#160;during fiscal 2018 primarily related to the remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and
liabilities at the reduced federal corporate tax rate of 21% enacted with the&#160;2017 Tax Act.


 the Company
does not amortize indefinite lived-intangible assets for financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax liability of $485
000 relates
to the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of intangible assets.


 2018
 the Company had
U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $80
818
000 for U.S. tax purposes
 which expire in&#160;fiscal&#160;2023
through 2036
 if not utilized. The annual utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in future years due
to the &#8220;change in ownership provisions&#8221; set forth in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has
Irish net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14
205
000
 which have an indefinite life.


 2018
 the Company has
not provided for U.S. federal and foreign withholding taxes on any excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments
in foreign subsidiaries
 as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested overseas. Generally
 such amounts become subject to U.S.
taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. Due to the complexities of the tax laws and assumptions
that would have to be made
 it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income tax provisions that may be required.

and 2017
 interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits were $1

that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

 which provides for awards of incentive
and non-qualified stock options

to attract and retain such individuals. Stock option grants under the Plan are granted with an exercise price at or above the fair
market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant
 generally vest over a three to five-year period and expire ten
years after the grant date.


 there were 2
000
000
shares of common stock available for distribution under the 2003 Plan. In January 2009
 the Company&#8217;s shareholders approved
an amendment to the 2003 Plan to increase the number of shares available under the 2003 Plan from 2
000
000 to 12
000
000 and to
establish the maximum number of shares issuable to any one individual in any particular year. As of August 2013
 no new awards
may be issued under the 2003 Plan.


 the Company&#8217;s
shareholders approved the 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (&#8220;2013 Plan&#8221;) which provides for an aggregate of 10
000
000
shares of the Company&#8217;s stock for awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options
 restricted stock and stock appreciation
rights for its officers
 employees
 consultants and directors to attract and retain such individuals. In February 2017
 the Company&#8217;s
shareholders approved an amendment to the 2013 Plan to increase the number of shares available under the 2013 Plan from 10
000
000
to 20
000
000. As of March 31
 2018
 9
277
500 shares had been issued under the 2013 Plan
 with 10
722
500 shares remaining available
for issuance.


the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016 amounted to $1
974
745
 $1
577
994 and $1
370
556
 respectively
 of which $704
772
$495
775 and $493
666
 respectively
 is included in selling expense and $1
269
973
 $1
082
219 and $876
890
 respectively
 is included
in general and administrative expense for the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. At March 31
 2018
 total
unrecognized compensation cost amounted to approximately $3
311
178
 representing 4
021
500 unvested options and 1
182
000 unvested
restricted shares. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.63 years for the unvested options
and 2.98 years for the unvested restricted shares. There were 356
700
 671
028 and 1
079
602 options exercised during the years
ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The Company did not recognize any related tax benefit for the years ended March
31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 as the effects were de minimis.

&#160;- A summary
of the options outstanding under the 2003 and 2013 Plans is as follows:

under the 2003 and 2013 Plans was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is affected by assumptions
regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The use of an option pricing model also requires the use of a number of
complex assumptions including expected volatility
 risk-free interest rate
 expected dividends
 and expected term. Expected volatility
is based on the Company&#8217;s historical volatility and the volatility of a peer group of companies over the expected life of
the option. The expected term and vesting of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise. The expected term
was determined using the simplified method available under current guidance. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option. The Company has not paid dividends on its common
stock in the past and does not plan to pay any dividends on its common stock in the near future. Current authoritative guidance
also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates
 if necessary
 in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company estimates forfeitures based on its expectation of future
experience while considering its historical experience.

 the Fourth Amendment increased
the maximum amount of the Credit Facility from $21
000
000 to $23
000

&#160;- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Castle Brands Inc. (&#8220;the Company&#8221;)
 its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries
 Castle Brands (USA) Corp. (&#8220;CB-USA&#8221;) and McLain &#38; Kyne
 Ltd. (&#8220;McLain &#38; Kyne&#8221;)

&#160;-
        The Company is principally engaged in the importation
 marketing and sale of premium and super premium rums
 whiskey
 liqueurs
        vodka and related non-alcoholic beverage products in the United States
 Canada
 Europe and Asia.
        









    
- The Company has revised its accumulated deficit and inventory balance at March 31
 2015 to properly state the historical carrying value of inventory. The Company determined that ending inventory at March 31
 2015 was overstated by $2
341
648
 which represent the cumulative impact of errors related to the changes in estimated freight costs
 excise taxes
 certain cost variances in prior years
 and accounting for intra-company inventory transfers between different locations. The Company assessed the materiality of these errors on previously issued consolidated financial statements and concluded that the error was immaterial to any single or cumulative period. As a result
 inventory was decreased by $2
341
648 and accumulated deficit increased by $2
341
648 at March 31
 2015.









    
 &#8211; In April 2018
 the Company extended the term of the $20
000
000 11% subordinated note to September 15
 2020 (as described in Note 18). The Company believes that its current cash and working capital and the availability under the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8C) will enable it to fund its obligations until it achieves profitability
 ensure continuity of supply of its brands and support new brand initiatives and marketing programs through at least June 2019. The Company can continue to meet its operating needs through additional mechanisms including additional or expanded debt financings
 potential equity offerings and limiting or adjusting the timing of additional inventory purchases based on available resources.

&#160;- Equity investments are carried at original cost adjusted for the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the investees&#8217; income
 losses and distributions. The Company assesses the carrying value of its equity investments when an indicator of a loss in value is present and records a loss in value of the investment when the assessment indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in the investment exists. The Company classifies its equity earnings of equity investments as a component of net income or loss.









    
&#160;- The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect anticipated losses on the trade accounts receivable balances. The Company calculates this allowance based on its history of write-offs
 level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and its relationships with and economic status of its customers. For the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for doubtful accounts of $59
012
 $123
200 and $61
000
 respectively.









    
&#160;&#8211; Revenue from product sales is recognized when the product is shipped to a customer (generally a distributor)
 title and risk of loss has passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale (FOB shipping point or FOB destination)
 and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is not recognized on shipments to control states in the United States until such time as product is sold through to the retail channel.









    
- Inventories are comprised of distilled spirits
 dry good raw materials (bottles
 labels
 corks and caps)
 packaging
 finished goods
 excise taxes and freight and are valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the weighted average cost method. The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Company&#8217;s forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including

 historical usage
 expected future demand and market requirements. A change to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold. See Note 3.

 2018
 2017 and 2016
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for obsolete and slow-moving inventory of $376
611
 $240
000
and $200
000
 respectively. The Company recorded these allowances and write-offs on both raw materials and finished goods
 primarily
in connection with spoilage and slow-moving inventory
 label and packaging changes made to certain brands
 as well as adjustments
to estimated freight costs and excise taxes and certain cost variances. The charges have been recorded as increases to Cost of
Sales in the respective years.







    
- Equipment consists of office equipment
 computers and software and furniture and fixtures. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related depreciation is removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to five years.









    
&#160;- Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price including related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized
 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis
 and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.



Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 350
 &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and
Other&#8221;
 impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting
units with the carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step impairment
test shall be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes
in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates that most
significantly affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth
 cost of sales
 selling and marketing expenses and
discount rates. Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#8217;s net assets
exceeds the unit&#8217;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of
goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill
recognized in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid. Rights
 trademarks
trade names and formulations are indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment at
least annually. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset group allocated to each reporting unit
with its allocated carrying amount.


assessment at March 31
 2018 and 2017
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of each reporting
unit were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&#8217; impairment testing results
 budget to actual results
Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based on this assessment
 the Company
determined that no quantitative assessment was required.







    
&#160;- Under ASC 310
 &#8220;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&#8221;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments recorded during the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016.









    
&#160;- The Company reflects as inventory costs freight-in and related external handling charges relating to the purchase of raw materials and finished goods. These costs are charged to cost of sales at the time the underlying product is sold. The Company also incurs shipping costs in connection with its various marketing activities
 including the shipment of point of sale materials to the Company&#8217;s regional sales managers and customers
 and the costs of shipping product in connection with its various marketing programs and promotions. These shipping charges are included in selling expense and were $2
797
701
 $2
347
121 and $2
635
430 for the years ended March 31
 2018
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.









    
&#160;- Excise taxes and duty are computed at standard rates based on alcohol proof per gallon/liter and are paid after finished goods are imported into the United States or other relevant jurisdiction and then transferred out of &#8220;bond.&#8221; Excise taxes and duty are recorded to inventory as a component of the cost of the underlying finished goods. When the underlying products are sold &#8220;ex warehouse&#8221;
 the sales price reflects the taxes paid and the inventoried excise taxes and duties are charged to cost of sales.









    
&#160;- The Company incurs charges from its distributors for a variety of transactions and services rendered by the distributor
 including product depletions
 product samples for various promotional purposes
 in-store tastings and training where legal
 and local advertising where legal. Such charges are reflected as selling expense as incurred. Also
 the Company has entered into arrangements with certain of its distributors whereby the purchase of a particular product or products by a distributor is accompanied by a percentage of the sale being composed of promotional goods or as a predetermined discount percentage of dollars off invoice. In such cases
 the cost of the promotional goods is charged to cost of sales and dollars off invoice are a reduction to revenue.









    
&#160;- The functional currency for the Company&#8217;s foreign operations is the Euro in Ireland and the British Pound in the United Kingdom. Under ASC 830
 &#8220;Foreign Currency Matters&#8221;
 the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations.









    
&#160;- ASC 825
 &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The Company believes that there is no material difference between the fair-value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the Company&#8217;s balance sheets due to the short-term maturity of these instruments
 or with respect to the Company&#8217;s debt
 as compared to the current borrowing rates available to the Company.

 which accomplishes the following key objectives:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    



based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument&#8217;s
categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are as follows:



    
    
    

    
    
Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and inputs that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

    
    
    









    
&#160;- In December 2017
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;2017 Tax Act&#8221;) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company
 most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31
 2017 and the recognition of tax net operating loss carryfowards. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27
 2017 as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018
 including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction
 acceleration of tax revenue recognition
 capitalization of research and development expenditures
 additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.

which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221;
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;) in
the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. As such
 the Company&#8217;s financial results reflect the
income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. The Company did not identify items for
which the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act have not been completed and a reasonable estimate could not be determined as of
March 31
 2018.


the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% for all corporations effective January 1
 2018. For fiscal year companies
the change in law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the fiscal year
 which in the Company&#8217;s
case is 30.79% for the fiscal year&#160;ended&#160;March 31
 2018. Thereafter
 the applicable statutory rate is 21.0%.


to reflect the effects of the&#160;2017 Tax Act&#160;in the period in which the&#160;2017 Tax Act&#160;was enacted. Accordingly
the Company reduced the statutory rate that applies to its year-to-date&#160;fiscal 2018&#160;earnings from 34.0% to 30.79%. In
addition
 the Company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new rate. The combined result of the 2017
Tax Act resulted in a tax benefit of $40
485 during the three months ended December 31
 2017.


 deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation allowance is provided to the extent
a deferred tax asset is not considered recoverable.

to uncertain tax positions in general and administrative expense.







    
&#160;- The costs of research
 development and product improvement are charged to expense as incurred and are included in selling expense.









    
- Advertising and marketing costs are expensed when the advertising first appears in its respective medium. Advertising expense

&#160;- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates include the accounting for items such as evaluating annual impairment tests
 derivative instruments and equity issuances
 warrant valuation
 stock-based compensation
 allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 amortization and expense accruals.









    
    
&#8211;
        In February 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02
 Income Statement &#8211; Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification
        of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;ASU 2018-02&#8221;)
 which allows for stranded tax effects
        in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the&#160;2017&#160;Tax Act to be reclassified to retained earnings. This
        guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted.&#160;The Company has evaluated the new
        guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results of
        operations
 cash flows and financial condition.
        

 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
        &#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.&#8221; ASU 2017-09 provides guidance about
        which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. This
        guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted.&#160;The Company has evaluated the new
        guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results of
        operations
 cash flows and financial condition.



 the FASB
issued ASU 2017-05
 &#8220;Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying
the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets.&#8221; ASU 2017-05 clarifies
the scope and accounting of a financial asset that meets the definition of an &#8220;in-substance nonfinancial asset&#8221; and
defines the term &#8220;in-substance nonfinancial asset.&#8221; ASU 2017-05 also adds guidance for partial sales of nonfinancial
assets. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted.&#160;The Company has evaluated
the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results
of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2017-04
 &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (Topic 350).&#8221; ASU
2017-04 removes Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2020
 with
early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance
will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU No. 2017-01
 &#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&#8221; This ASU
 which
must be applied prospectively
 provides a narrower framework to be used to determine if a set of assets and activities constitutes
a business than under current guidance and is generally expected to result in greater consistency in the application of ASC Topic
805
 Business Combinations. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted.&#160;The
Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on
the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-18
 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
 a consensus of the FASB&#8217;s Emerging Issues
Task Force (the &#8220;Task Force&#8221;).&#8221; The new standard requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change
during the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash
equivalents. Entities will also be required to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of
the restrictions. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted.&#160;The Company
has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s
results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2016-16
 &#8220;Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.&#8221; This ASU removes the prohibition
against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than
inventory. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. Entities must apply a
modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.&#160;The
Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on
the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-15
 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments&#8221;
 which
provides guidance on eight cash flow classification issues with the objective of reducing differences in practice. The new standard
is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. Adoption is required to be on a retrospective
basis
 unless impracticable for any of the amendments
 in which case a prospective application is permitted.&#160;The Company has
evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s
results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-08
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross
versus Net) (&#8220;ASU 2016-08&#8221;). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&#8220;ASU 2014-9&#8221;)
 instead
 the amendments in this ASU are intended
to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether
an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as
the new revenue standard issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new revenue standard outlines a new
single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most
current revenue recognition guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new revenue standard contains principles to determine
the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine
when and how revenue is recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised
goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. In addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018.
The Company expects to transition to&#160;ASU 2016-08&#160;using the Modified-Retrospective Method
 under which the prior years&#8217;
data is not recast; instead
 a single adjustment is made to equity at the beginning of the initial year of&#160;application. The
Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on
the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02
 &#8220;Leases.&#8221; The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record
a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified
as either finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new
standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2019. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees
for capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented
in the financial statements
 with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance
to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2016-01
 &#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities&#8221;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value
option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Also
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to
the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale
debt securities. The new standard is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018
 and upon adoption
 an entity should apply the
amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which
the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial
liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income.&#160;The
Company has evaluated the new guidance and has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on
the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

        In August 2017
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12
 &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements
        to Accounting for Hedging Activities&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2017-12&#8221;)
 which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships
        to better portray the economic results of an entity&#8217;s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain
        targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update
        is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance
        in the current period and determined that its adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results
        of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.
        

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
        &#8220;Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
&#8221; which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee
        share-based payment transactions
 including the accounting for income taxes and statutory tax withholding requirements
 as well
        as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance became effective for the Company beginning April 1
 2017. The Company
        determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
        &#8220;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&#8221; which changes the measurement principle for inventory
        from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling
        prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new
        guidance has been applied on a prospective basis and became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2017. The Company determined
        that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations

Any forced conversion will be applied ratably to the holders of all Convertible Notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement based on each holder&#8217;s then-current note holdings. In connection with the Note Purchase Agreement
 each purchaser of the Convertible Notes was required to execute a joinder to the subordination agreement
 by and among ACF and certain other junior lenders to the Company; the Company is not a party to the subordination agreement. During the year ended March 31

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

























































Expected term of share-based compensation awards

 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
