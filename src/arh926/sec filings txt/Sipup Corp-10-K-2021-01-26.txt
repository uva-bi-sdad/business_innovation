Item
1. Business.

Our
Company

Sipup
Corporation was incorporated on October 31
 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada for the purpose of producing
 packing and
selling flavored yogurts. &nbsp;

On
May 15
 2019
 Sipup Corp. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) entered into a short-form agreement with Enlightened Capital Ltd.
 an Israeli
company with offices Ramat Gan
 Israel (&ldquo;Enlightened&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which all outstanding ordinary shares of Enlightened
were exchanged for shares of the Company common stock
 $0.001 par value per share (the &ldquo;Transaction&rdquo;). In the Transaction
the Company issued to the sole shareholder of Enlightened an aggregate of 18
000
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock.
Following the Transaction
 Enlightened became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.



    
    


Enlightened
is also engaged
 in the field of green energy and is licensed to internationally trade in Certified Emission Reductions
 also
known as carbon credits (&ldquo;CERs&rdquo;)
 as issued by the UN until 2040. Enlightened owns Programmes of Activities (&ldquo;PoAs&rdquo;)
certified for registration under the &ldquo;Clean Development Mechanism&rdquo; (CDM) established by the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris
Agreement to the United Nation&rsquo;s Framework Convention on Climate Change (&ldquo;UNFCCC&rdquo;)

The
ability of Enlightened to acquire the patented technology by exercising the aforementioned option is subject to the successful
capital raise by the Company of a minimum of approximately $4.5 million for the combined activities. The Company does not presently
have any commitments for these funds and no assurance can be provided that the funds can be raised on commercially reasonable
terms or at all. Even if the Company is able to raise the necessary capital
 no assurance can be provided that it will be able
to commercialize the patented technology.

On
October 1
 2020
 the Company executed a non-binding Letter of Intent (&ldquo;LOI&rdquo;) to merge with VeganNation Services Ltd.
a company formed under the laws of the State of Israel (&ldquo;VeganNation&rdquo;).&nbsp; As outlined in the LOI
 the proposed
merger will be structured as a reverse triangular merger pursuant to which a newly formed subsidiary of the Company will merge
with and into VeganNation
 with VeganNation as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.VeganNation is
a global plant-based company building an all-encompassing conscious consumer ecosystem
 connecting and empowering plant-based
and sustainable businesses and individuals. Management of the Company believes that the growth of sustainable and plant-based
consumer goods presents a unique opportunity to participate in the fastest growing lifestyle globally.

Additionally
VeganNation has
 on November 26
 2020
 entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (the &ldquo;LOI&rdquo;) to acquire a vegan
industry company located in the United States (the &ldquo;Target&rdquo;) for a $4 million acquisition. VeganNation has assigned
the LOI to the Company
 and the Company intends to consummate the acquisition directly. These and other terms in the LOI may be
adjusted
 subject to completion by the Company of its due diligence review and subsequent negotiation with the Target.

In
connection with the proposed transaction
 the VeganNation stockholders are expected to receive securities of Sipup that will be
equal to approximately 51% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company at the closing of the proposed merger
 on
a fully diluted basis. Following the closing of the proposed merger
 if any
 VeganNation will effect a change in the Company&rsquo;s
Board of Directors and management as VeganNation&rsquo;s management deems appropriate.

Corporate
History &amp; Recent Events

On
October 31
 2012
 the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Through fiscal year 2013
 we were engaged
in the production
 packing and selling of flavored yogurts and have not generated any revenue; our independent auditors have issued
an opinion about our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our audited financial statements for the year ended
November 30
 2018. Our accumulated deficit is $342
543 as of November 30
 2018. We currently have no revenue generating business
and are focusing on finalizing the transactions discussed above.

During
March 2019 the Company issued Adi Zim Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Adi&rdquo;) 644
000 restricted shares of the Company&rsquo;s common
stock in consideration for remittance of $100
000 for purposes of paying outstanding Company obligation to third parties&nbsp;

During
April 2019
 the Company and Rosario Capital Ltd. (&ldquo;Rosario&rdquo;) have entered into additional service agreement
 pursuant
to which Rosario is providing to the Company certain financial advisory and other services. In consideration of any and all Rosario&rsquo;s
Services
 the Company has issued to Rosario 900
000 restricted shares of common stock. The service agreement will be terminated
on December 31
 2020. The fair value of the restricted shares as of the date of issuance was $144
000 using the share price on
the day of issuance.



    
    




We
do not maintain any insurance. Because we do not have any insurance
 if we are made a party of a legal action
 we may not have
sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease
operations.



As
of January 26
 2021
 we have two employees
 all of whom are officers. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining
agreement.




offices are located at 3 Kiryat Hamada
 floor
 Jerusalem
 Israel. Our telephone number is 1-305-999-5232.

Government
Regulation

We
will be required to comply with all regulations
 rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction
which we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required governments approvals present that we need approval
from or any existing government regulation on our business.

We
currently have not obtained any copyrights
 patents or trademarks. We do not anticipate filing any copyright or trademark applications
related to any assets over the next 12 months.

Going
Concern

Our
cash balance is $Nil as of November 30
 2018. We do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels
of operations beyond one year&rsquo;s time.

Our
independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we
can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is
because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There
is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.

We
anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations
 if any
 will be insufficient to satisfy
our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company
will seek to obtain these funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements
 debt or other sources of financing.
If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations
which could harm our business
 financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not
be available on favorable terms
 if at all.

At
the present time
 we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock
 it will likely not be sufficient to support
our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations
 we will either suspend product development
and marketing activities until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations entirely

Subject
to raising working capital
 for which we have no commitments
 management may also consider other business opportunities
 including
a strategic merger or acquisition outside our current line of business
 in order to increase shareholder value.



    
    


Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital
resources.

Limited
operating history; Need for additional capital

There
is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage
operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business
is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise
 including limited capital resources and possible
cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.

We
have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory
terms
 we may be unable to continue
 develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to
existing shareholders.

Item

Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information
required under this item.

Item

 if any

 will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors
and will depend on our then current financial condition
 results of operations
 capital requirements and other factors deemed
relevant by the Board of Directors. There are no contractual restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends.

SECURITIES
AUTHORIZED UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

We
have no equity compensation or stock option plans. We may in the future adopt a stock option plan as our mineral exploration activities
progress.



    
    


Item
7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Results
of Operations

From
November 30
 2017 to November 30
 2018

Our
loss since inception is $342
543 related primarily to professional fees
 officers&rsquo; compensation
 and the incorporation of the
Company
 bank charges and office supplies. We have not meaningfully commenced our proposed business operations and will not do
so until after receiving sufficient financing.



For
the year ended November 30
 2018 and 2017
 we had no revenues.

Costs
and Operating Expenses

During
the year ended November 30
 2018 we had recorded expenses of $193
942 comprised of Professional fees of $161
000
 filling fees
of $32
942 resulting in a net loss of $193
942 as compared to expenses of $12
560 comprised of Professional fees of $11
000
 and
filling fees of $1
560 resulting in a net loss of $12
560 for the fiscal year ended November 30
 2017.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of November 30
 2018
 the company had $Nil cash and our liabilities were $127
475
 consisting primarily of Accounts payable and
accrued expenses of $113
455 and Loans from stockholders of $14
020. As of November 30
 2017
 the company had $Nil cash and our
liabilities were $83
533
 consisting primarily of Accounts payable and accrued expenses of $69
513 and Loans from stockholders
of $14
020.

Our
auditors have issued a &ldquo;going concern&rdquo; opinion
 meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going
business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until after receiving
sufficient financing and implementing our plan of operations. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business.
The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $25
000.

Existing
working capital
 further advances and debt instruments
 and anticipated cash flow are expected to be inadequate to fund our operations
over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally
 we have financed operations
to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan
 management
anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii)
developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. Although we intend to finance these
expenses with further issuances of securities
 and debt issuances
 no assurance can be provided that we will be able to raise
funds on commercially acceptable terms or at all.

We
anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations
 if any
 will be insufficient to satisfy
our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company
will seek to obtain those funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements
 debt or other sources of financing.
If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations
which could harm our business
 financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not
be available on favorable terms
 if at all.

At
the present time
 we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock
 it will likely not be sufficient to support
our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations
 we will either suspend product development
and marketing activities until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations entirely. Because we have been unable to raise additional
cash
 Management may consider other business opportunities in order to maintain and increase shareholder value.

We
are highly dependent upon the success of the private offerings of equity or debt securities
 as described herein. Therefore
 the
failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans
 which would likely not even
be possible for the Company. At such time these funds are required
 management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing.
If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities
 or secure a loan
 the
Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result
 investors would lose all of their investment.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As
of November 30
 2018
 management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting based
on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;) and SEC guidance on conducting
such assessments. Based on that evaluation
 they concluded that
 during the period covered by this report
 such internal control
over financial reporting were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below.
This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely
affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.

A
material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
In connection with the assessment described above
 management identified the following internal control over financial reporting
deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of November 30
 2018.


Financial Reporting and Closing Process: We did not maintain
an effective financial reporting and closing process to prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We determined that
controls over timely and complete financial statement reviews
 effective journal entry controls
 and appropriate reconciliation
processes were missing or&nbsp;ineffective. Further
 we were unable to complete regulatory filings timely as required by the rules




Qualified Personnel: We lacked a sufficient number of
qualified accounting personnel in key financial reporting positions to operate processes and controls over the year end close
process. As a result
 a reasonable possibility exists that material misstatements in our financial statements will not be prevented




Control Monitoring: Our controls for monitoring the adequacy
of the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting across the Company were&nbsp;ineffective.
As a result
 a reasonable possibility exists that material misstatements in our financial statements will not be prevented or



Management
believes that the material weaknesses above did not have an effect on our financial results

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls
 we have initiated
or plan to initiate the following series of measures.

We
will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And we plan to appoint one or more outside
directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by
management when funds are available to us.

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors
 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over
financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or
improvements
 as necessary and as funds allow.

There
have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of
2018 which has materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.
This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by the Company&rsquo;s independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company
to provide management report in the Annual Report.

Director
Independence

None
of our directors presently qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ
Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests
 such as that the director is not
 and
has not been for at least three years
 one of our employees and that neither the director
 nor any of his family members has engaged
in various types of business dealings with us. In addition
 our board of director has not made a subjective determination as to
its sole director that no relationships exist which
 in the opinion of our board of director
 would interfere with the exercise
of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director
 though such subjective determination is required by
the NASDAQ rules. &nbsp;Had our board of director made these determinations
 our board of director would have reviewed and discussed
information provided by the director and us with regard to each director business and personal activities and relationships as
they may relate to us and our management.



    
    


Conflicts
of Interest

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed
by such committees are performed by our current directors. The Board of Director has not established an audit committee and does
not have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion
that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early development stage company
 and to date
 such directors have
been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors have the
authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions.

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings

There
are no legal proceedings that have occurred in the past 10 years concerning our sole officer and director which involved a criminal
conviction
 a criminal proceeding
 an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one&rsquo;s participation in the securities
or banking industries
 or a finding of securities or commodities law violations.&nbsp;

FAMILY
RELATIONS

There
are no family relationships among the directors and officers of Sipup Corporation.

AUDIT
COMMITTEE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed
by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not
have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the
opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early exploration stage company and has only four directors
and to date
 such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest
in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and
audit issues that may affect management decisions.

There
are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above
 we are not aware of any other conflicts
of interest with any of our executive officers or directors.

CODE
OF ETHICS

The
Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officers
 principal financial officer
 principal
accounting officer or controller
 or persons performing similar functions. The Company has not adopted a code of ethics because
it currently has minimal operations.

SECTION
16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who own more than ten
percent of a registered class of our equity securities
 file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive
officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a)
forms they file. Based on our review of filings made on the SEC website
 and the fact of us not receiving certain forms or written
representations from certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements
 we believe that
during the year ended November 30
 2018
 our executive officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders complied
with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.&nbsp;

of the same securities
 and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any
pecuniary beneficial interest. Except as noted below
 each person has sole voting and investment power.

The
percentages below are calculated based on 24

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
TO
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF
SIPUP
CORPORATION
 INC.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of SIPUP Corporation
 Inc (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of November 30
 2018 and
2017
 the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; deficit and cash flows for each
of the two years in the period ended November 30
 2018
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial
statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position
of the Company as of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended November 30
 2018
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Going
Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1B to the financial statements
 the Company has not yet generated material revenues from its operations to fund its activities
and is therefore dependent upon external sources for financing its operations. As of November 30
 2018
 the Company has incurred
accumulated deficit of $342
942 and negative operating cash flows. These factor among others
 as discussed in Note 1B to the financial
statements raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans
concerning these matters are also described in Note 1B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of&rsquo; these uncertainties.

Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audit
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SIPUP
CORPORATION
NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE
1 &ndash; NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Sipup&nbsp;
Corporation (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a Nevada Corporation incorporated on October 31
 2012. For additional information see
subsequent events

Basis
of Presentation

The
Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;). These financial statements are presented in US dollars.

Going
concern

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of November 30
 2018
 the Company
has an accumulated deficit of $342
543 from operations and has earned no revenues to cover its operating costs. The Company intends
to fund future operations through equity financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working
capital and other cash requirements for the year ending November 30
 2018.

The
ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing
to continue operations
 and development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional
funds through public or private placement offerings.

These
factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE
2 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The
financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(US GAAP).

Use
of estimates in the preparation of financial statements

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements
 and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
As applicable to these financial statements
 the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the going concern assumptions
and stock based compensation.

Cash
and cash equivalents
 and Restricted cash

Cash
equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments which include short term bank deposits (up to three months from date of deposit)
that are not restricted as to withdrawals or use that are readily convertible to cash with maturities of three months or less
as of the date acquired. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&ldquo;FDIC&rdquo;) up to $250
000.&nbsp;

Earnings
per Share

The
Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 &ldquo;Earnings Per Share&rdquo; ASC 260 requires presentation of
both basic and diluted earnings per share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise
options granted to employees. As November 30
 2018
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.




    
    


Income
Taxes

Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes.&rdquo; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered
or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Stock
based compensation

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC
718 requires all share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value using
an option pricing model. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.

Equity
instruments granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505
 Equity. The final measurement date for the
fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument
is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance
on fair value measurements
 which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
as the case may be
 in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value may be based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes
a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation
techniques
 are assigned a hierarchical level.

The
following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:

-
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.

-
Level 2: Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments);

-
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs (including assumptions in determining the fair value of certain
investments).

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]





NOTE
1 &#8211; NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Sipup&#160;
Corporation (the Company) is a Nevada Corporation incorporated on October 31
 2012. For additional information see
subsequent events

Basis
of Presentation

The
Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP). These financial statements are presented in US dollars.

Going
concern

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of November 30
 2018
 the Company
has an accumulated deficit of $342
543 from operations and has earned no revenues to cover its operating costs. The Company intends
to fund future operations through equity financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working
capital and other cash requirements for the year ending November 30
 2018.

The
ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing
to continue operations
 and development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional
funds through public or private placement offerings.

These
factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.







The entire disclosure for the business description and basis of presentation concepts.  Business description describes the nature and type of organization including but not limited to organizational structure as may be applicable to holding companies
 parent and subsidiary relationships
 business divisions
 business units
 business segments
 affiliates and information about significant ownership of the reporting entity.  Basis of presentation describes the underlying basis used to prepare the financial statements (for example
 US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting
 IFRS).

NOTE
2 &#8211; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The
financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(US GAAP).

Use
of estimates in the preparation of financial statements

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements
 and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
As applicable to these financial statements
 the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the going concern assumptions
and stock based compensation.

Cash
and cash equivalents
 and Restricted cash

Cash
equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments which include short term bank deposits (up to three months from date of deposit)
that are not restricted as to withdrawals or use that are readily convertible to cash with maturities of three months or less
as of the date acquired. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250
000.&#160;

Earnings
per Share

The
Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 Earnings Per Share ASC 260 requires presentation of
both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise
options granted to employees. As November 30
 2018
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.


Income
Taxes

Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered
or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Stock
based compensation

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC
718 requires all share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value using
an option pricing model. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.

Equity
instruments granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505
 Equity. The final measurement date for the
fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument
is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance
on fair value measurements
 which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
as the case may be
 in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value may be based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes
a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation
techniques
 are assigned a hierarchical level.

The
following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:

-
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.

-
Level 2: Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments);

-
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs (including assumptions in determining the fair value of certain
investments).
