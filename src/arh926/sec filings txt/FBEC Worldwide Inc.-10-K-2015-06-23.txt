This Report contains a number of forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and expectations with respect to our business, strategies, products, future results and events and financial performance.&#160;&#160;All statements made in this Report other than statements of historical fact, including statements that address operating performance, events or developments that management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, statements related to distributor channels, volume growth, revenues, profitability, new products, adequacy of funds from operations, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results and non-historical information, are forward looking statements.&#160;&#160;In particular, the words believe
 expect

 &#8220;anticipate, estimate, may, will, variations of such words
 and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements
 but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking.&#160;&#160;These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
 including those discussed herein.&#160;&#160;Our actual results
 performance or achievements could differ materially from historical results as well as those expressed in
 anticipated or implied by these forward-looking statements.&#160;&#160;We do not undertake any obligation to revise any forward-looking statements whether because of new information
 future events or otherwise.


Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements
 which are based on management's current expectations and projections about future events
 are not guarantees of future performance
 are subject to risks
 uncertainties and assumptions (including those described below) and apply only as of the date of this Report.&#160;&#160;Our actual results
 performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in
 or implied by
 these forward-looking statements.&#160;&#160;Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in press releases and other communications to shareholders issued by us from time to time which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business.




In March 2010
 we acquired certain intellectual property rights for a proprietary relaxation beverage known as 


Our mission is to supply the highest quality New Age/Alternative Beverages products at the most economical cost to distributors servicing the retail industry and directly to consumers through our website.&#160;&#160;Our service-oriented approach integrates the elements of research
 development
 product quality assurance
 packaging/distribution efficiency
 and advanced management systems to generate higher profit margins for our retailers.&#160;&#160;Collaboration with our distributors and retailers carrying our product is expected to build long-term relationships and help us manage our growth.


In May 2014
 the Company sold its 51% stake in Blue 22 Entertainment for the receipt of 50 million common shares of NX Global
 Inc. stock. Because the stock received does not have a current filing on Pink Sheets no value has been placed on the stock and no gain or loss has been recognized.


In June 2014
 the Company entered into an agreement to be the distributor at retail of a oil emulsification product used to separate oil from various waste streams produced from oil wells
 and oil storage or shipping. We will issue 5
000 preferred shares
 when available
 after filing a designation which will be earned upon issuance.


















All remaining entertainment subsidiaries were sold on June 26
 2014. The company does not retain any rights nor any liabilities of the disposed of subsidiaries.


We need additional capital to pursue our business plan and conduct our operations; however
 the ability to obtain the necessary and appropriate funding is uncertain.&#160;&#160;We intend to expand our product line
 either through development or acquisition
 and intend to hire sufficient sales personnel necessary for us to gain a greater distribution network for our products. We believe that we will require significant additional capital resources from outside sources including equity and/or debt financings in order to meet our goals and continue operations.&#160;&#160;We believe we need to raise between $500
000 and $600
000 in order to meet these goals.





The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;)
 which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern
 which is dependent upon the Company's ability to establish itself as a profitable business.&#160;&#160;At December 31
 2014
 the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $1
256
892 and for the year ended December 31
 2014
 incurred net losses of approximately $1
256
892.&#160;&#160;Management's plans to increase operations to include the marketing of the oil emulsification products by obtaining additional funds through the issuance of securities or borrowings.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 management is of the opinion that marketing combined with additional funding will result in improved operations and cash flow in 2015 and beyond. However
 there can be no assurance that management will be successful in obtaining additional funding or in attaining profitable operations.





These financial statements have been modified the to reflect accounting for our acquisition as a reverse&#160;&#160;acquisition and reflect the operations of the acquired company for 2014 and no activity in 2013. All references to comparative data of FBEC Worldwide
 Inc f/k/a Frontier Beverage Company
 Inc. have been removed for period prior to January 13
 2014.





As of December 31
 2014
 our working capital deficit was approximately $1
122
071
 our accumulated deficit was approximately $1
256
892 and our stockholders&#8217; deficit was approximately $1
122
071.&#160;&#160;Operating loss was approximately $228
969 during the period from January 13
 2014 (date of inception) through December 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Net cash outlay from operations was approximately $10
000 for the year ended December 31
 2014.


We began the operation of our current business plan in January 2014 and have not yet attained a level of revenue to allow us to meet our current overhead. We have historically reported net losses from operations and negative cash flows.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 we have not yet attained a level of revenues to allow us to meet our current overhead and we had zero cash at December 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;In view of these facts
 the continued successful operation of the Company is dependent upon us obtaining additional financing and achieving a positive cash flow while maintaining adequate liquidity.&#160;&#160;Based on our current marketing plan and expected sales demand
 we do not contemplate attaining profitable operations until 2015
 and there is no assurance that such an operating level can ever be achieved.&#160;&#160;We are dependent upon obtaining additional financing in order to adequately fund working capital
 infrastructure
 manufacturing expenses and sales and marketing expenses to gain market recognition
 so that we can achieve a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure
 none of which can be assured.


















Management believes it will be able to raise the capital required to execute the Company's business plan and become profitable; however
 due to conditions and influences out of our control
 including the current state of the national economy
 we cannot guarantee that profitability will be achieved or that it will be achieved in the stated time frame
 nor is there any assurance that such an operating level can ever be achieved.


We expect to spend substantial amounts on the development or acquisition of new businesses. Further
 we may not have sufficient resources to fully develop any new products unless we are able to raise additional financing on acceptable terms or secure funds from new or existing partners.&#160;&#160;We can make no assurances that additional financing will be available on favorable terms or at all.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 these conditions may increase the cost to raise capital. If additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities
 the issuance of such securities would result in dilution to our existing stockholders.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 these conditions may increase costs to raise capital and/or result in further dilution. Our failure to raise capital when needed would adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations
 and could force us to reduce or cease our operations.


We believe that over the next twelve (12) months
 we will be able to meet the costs of growth and public reporting with funds generated from operations and additional amounts generated through debt and equity financing.&#160;&#160;Although management believes that the required financing to fund product development and increasing inventory levels can be secured at terms satisfactory to the Company
 there is no guarantee these funds will be made available
 and if funds are available
 that the terms will be satisfactory to the Company.

Our Company is a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act
 and as such
 is not required to provide the information required under this Item.





All financial statements required by this Item are listed in Part IV
 Item 15 of this Form 10-K
 are presented beginning on Page F-1
 and are incorporated herein by this reference.

















pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


















Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements
 we have assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2014
 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 or the COSO Framework.&#160;&#160;Management&#8217;s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.&#160;&#160;Based on this evaluation
 management has determined that as of December 31
 2014
 our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective and there were weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as outlined below.





Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management
 as appropriate
 in order to allow timely decisions in connection with required disclosure.





Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)
 the Mr. Harris
 the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (the Company&#8217;s principal financial and accounting officer)
 of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.


Based upon that evaluation
 the Company&#8217;s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31
 2014 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#8217;s management
 including the Company&#8217;s CEO and CFO
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
 due to the material weaknesses described below.


A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


The Company believes its weaknesses in internal controls and procedures is due to the Company's lack of sufficient personnel with expertise in the area of SEC
 generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and tax accounting procedures.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the Company lacks the personnel structure
 size and complexity to segregate duties sufficiently for proper controls. The Company has not implemented a formal system of internal control that provides for multiple levels of supervision and review.


The Company is currently without sufficient funds to hire additional personnel with expertise in these areas and to segregate duties for proper controls and until such time as additional personnel are hired
 the Company believes that it will continue to recognize a weakness in its internal controls and procedures.


















The Company&#8217;s plan is to hire additional personnel to properly implement a control structure when the appropriate funds become available.&#160;&#160;In the meantime
 the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will continue to perform or supervise the performance of additional accounting and financial analyses and other post-closing procedures including detailed validation work with regard to balance sheet account balances
 additional analysis on income statement amounts and managerial review of all significant account balances and disclosures
 to ensure that the Company's Annual Report and the financial statements forming part thereof are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31
 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.





This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company&#8217;s registered public accounting firm pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 wherein non-accelerated filers are exempt from Sarbanes-Oxley internal control audit requirements.

&#160;Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires each of our officers and directors and each person who owns more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC an initial report of ownership and subsequent reports of changes in such ownership.

 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE





In March 2014
 the Company issued to officers and directors
 and a prior officer a total of 25
750 common shares for the settlement of $93
500 of liabilities resulting in a loss on the extinguishment of liabilities of $12
000 for the period from January 13

During 2014
 liabilities owed to Mr. Birmingham
 an affiliate of the Company
 of $9
767 and to Sweet Challenge

 of $16
858 were converted to notes payable totaling $26
625. The notes are unsecured
 due on demand and bear no interest.

 the Company has outstanding advances to former officers and directors aggregating $22
675. The advances are unsecured

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our securities are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or interdealer quotation system which would require that the Board of Directors include a majority of directors that are &#8220;independent.&#8221; Furthermore
 no members of our Board of Directors would qualify as &#8220;independent&#8221; directors as such term is defined in the NASDAQ Global Market listing standards.

 LLP for the audit of our 2014 financial statements.

 tax advice
 or tax planning.





















We incurred no other fees or expenses for the 2014 fiscal years for any other products or professional services rendered by RBSM LLP or MaloneBailey
 LLP other than as described above.





The Company does not currently maintain a separate audit committee.&#160;&#160;When necessary

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of FBEC Worldwide
 Inc. (formerly Frontier Beverage Company
 Inc.) (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31
 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&#8217; deficit
 and cash flows for the period from January 13
 2014 (inception) to December 31
 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from January 13
 2014 (inception) to December 31
 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

FBEC WORLDWIDE
 INC.
(FORMERLY FRONTIER BEVERAGE COMPANY
 INC.)











FBEC Worldwide
 Inc.
 f/k/a Frontier Beverage Company
 Inc. (the Company
 &#8220;FBEC&#8221;
 &#8220;we&#8221;
 &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a Wyoming corporation that was formed in November 2002 and commenced operations in April 2003. The Company was originally formed to provide fully automated remote data backup services for small to medium sized businesses. Currently
 the Company is engaged in developing additional beverage products and will search for markets for the KuudKleen&#8482; product.


On March 1
 2010
 the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Innovative Beverage Group Holdings
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation and a trademark assignment for the purchase of the intellectual property rights of a beverage created and developed by Innovative known as &#8220;Unwind.&#8221; The Company subsequently applied for and received a separate trademark featuring its new logo and the term Unwind Ultimate Relaxation in 2010. The Company intends to reformulate the product.


On February 3
 2014
 the Company purchased 90% of Dance Broadcast Systems
 Inc. for 10
000 Series A Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1
000
000 and a par value of $.001. The preference allows the holder to vote 66.67% of the available votes for all purposes regardless of the other votes outstanding as long as one share of this series is outstanding. The designation for the Series A Preferred Stock was filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on January 24
 2014. This transaction was recorded as a reverse merger with January 13
 2014 now becoming the inception date for accounting purposes. This transaction caused a change of control of the company to Vinyl Groove Productions
 Inc.


In May 2014
 the Company sold its 51% stake in Blue 22 Entertainment for the receipt of 50 million common shares of NX Global
 Inc. stock. Because the stock received does not have a current filing on Pink Sheets and no active market exists for the shares
 no value has been placed on the stock received. The subsidiary had no assets or liabilities on the date of disposal and no consideration was received.


In June 2014
 the Company entered into an agreement to be the distributor at retail of a oil emulsification product used to separate oil from various waste streams produced from oil wells
 and oil storage or shipping. The Company agreed to issue 5
000 Series C preferred shares
 when available
 after filing a designation which will be earned upon issuance. As of the date of this report
 the Series C Preferred Stock designation has not been filed nor have any preferred shares been issued under the agreement.


On June 30
 2014
 the Company increased its authorized common shares from 500
000
000 to 950
000
000.


On September 6
 2014
 the Company increased its authorized common shares from 950
000
000 to 1
970
000
000.


All remaining entertainment subsidiaries were disposed on June 26
 2014. The company does not retain any rights nor any liabilities of the disposed of subsidiaries. The disposal resulted in a gain on the sale of $53
329 (see Note 4).


On October 16
 2014
 the Company increased its authorized common shares from 1
970
000
000 to 2
970
000
000.


















On October 28
 2014
 the Company was re-domiciled to the State of Wyoming and increased its authorized common shares to 5
000
000
000.


On December 8
 2014
 the Company changed its name to FBEC Worldwide
 Inc.


On December 23
 2014
 the company effected 1:1
000 reverse split on the outstanding shares. All share and per share amounts herein have been retroactively restated to reflect the split.





The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;)
 which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern
 which is dependent upon the Company's ability to establish itself as a profitable business.&#160;&#160;At December 31
 2014
 the Company has an accumulated deficit of $1
256
892
 and for the period from January 13
 2014 (date of inception) through December 31
 2014 incurred net loss of $1
256
892.&#160;&#160;These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties
 nor do they include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.


The Company&#8217;s ability to continue in business is dependent upon obtaining sufficient financing or attaining profitable operations.&#160;&#160;However
 there can be no assurance that management will be successful in obtaining additional funding or in attaining profitable operations








The Company considers amounts held by financial institutions and short-term investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash and cash equivalents.&#160;&#160;In the future
 the Company may periodically make deposits with financial institutions in excess of the maximum federal insurance limits (FDIC) of $250
000 per bank. As of December 31
 2014
 the Company had no cash or cash equivalents.





The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of wholly-owned subsidiaries Blue 22 Entertainment
 Inc. and 22 Social Club
 Inc. and 90% owned Dance Broadcast System
 Inc. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. All subsidiaries had been sold or disposed of at December 31
 2014.





The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718 and accounts for stock-based compensation to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505. The fair value of option awards is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility; and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management&#8217;s best estimates
 but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions
 the Company&#8217;s stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.





















The Company calculates earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.&#160;&#160;Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding plus all potentially dilutive shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.&#160;&#160;Such potential dilutive shares of Common Stock consist of stock options
 non-vested shares (restricted stock)
 shares underlying convertible debt&#160;&#160;and warrants.&#160;&#160;During the period from inception through December 31
 2014
 all shares underlying the convertible debt were excluded as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.





Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted FASB ASC 740 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes&#8221; as of its inception hich requires an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. Pursuant to FASB ASC 740
 the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years.





The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
 future results of operations will be affected.







Direct costs incurred with the issuance of notes payable are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan. For the year ended December 31
 2014
 the Company incurred amortization expense of $153
344 associated with debt discounts related to derivative liabilities.





The Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of December 31
 2014
 which consist of convertible instruments and rights to shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock
 and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for liability classification under ASC 815.

ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that
 if met
 require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract
 (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional
 as described.


















The Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under this statement and includes this additional information in the notes to the financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. The estimated fair value of cash
 accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the short maturity of these instruments. At December 31
 2014
 the Company did not have any other financial instruments.





ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity&#8217;s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels
 which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:














Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical
 unrestricted assets or liabilities.








Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly
 including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g.
 interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

















Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include accounts receivable
 other current assets
 accounts payable
 accrued compensation and accrued expenses. The fair value of the Company&#8217;s notes payable is estimated based on current rates that would be available for debt of similar terms which is not significantly different from its stated value.







Professional standards generally provides three criteria that
 if met
 require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)&#160;the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract
 (b)&#160;the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c)&#160;a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.&#160;&#160;Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as &#8220;The Meaning of &#8220;Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument&#8221;.


The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional standards when &#8220;Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features
&#8221; as those professional standards pertain to &#8220;Certain Convertible Instruments.&#8221; Accordingly
 the Company records

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws. In the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset
 the guidance requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such assets. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized.


















The Company has net operating losses at December 31

The provisions of ASC 740 require companies to recognize in their financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit
recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods and disclosure.

 the adoption of these provisions of ASC 740 did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. The Company&#8217;s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions
 if any
 as income tax expense.
