The Company was formed in Nevada on October 9
 2007 under the name Semper Flowers
 Inc.&#160;&#160;On May 15
 2009
 the Company changed its name to SF Blu Vu
 Inc.&#160;&#160;On September 20
 2011
 the Company changed its name to LIVEWIRE ERGOGENICS INC.

Under the Purchase Agreement dated June 30
 2011 (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with LIVEWIRE MC2
 LLC
 a California limited liability company
 (&#8220;LiveWire MC2&#8221;) and the selling members of LiveWire MC2 (&#8220;Selling Members&#8221;)
 the Company issued 36
000
000 (30
000
000 shares pre stock split of 1 additional&#160;share for every five shares held) shares of common stock to the Selling Members in exchange for 100% of LiveWire MC2.&#160;&#160;As such
 LiveWire MC2 became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

The Purchase Agreement has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method for business combinations
 and accordingly the transaction has been treated as a recapitalization of LiveWire MC2
 with LiveWire MC2 as the accounting acquirer and the Company as the accounting acquiree. For legal purposes LiveWire MC2 is the legal acquiree and the Company is the legal acquirer and surviving corporation.&#160;&#160;The shares issued are treated as being issued for cash and are shown as outstanding for the period presented in the same manner as for a stock split.&#160;&#160;The Company was a shell prior to the merger
 having no significant assets or liabilities
 and seeking a viable business to acquire.




Management of the Company intends for the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary LIVEWIRE MC2
 LLC
 a California limited liability company
 (&#8220;LiveWire MC2&#8221;) to become a profitable entity with its focus on providing Chewable Energy Supplements and other functional foods as determined by needs.&#160;&#160;The risks and uncertainties described below may affect the business
 financial condition or operating results:



The Company is subject to substantially all the risks inherent in the creation of a new business. As a result of its small size and capitalization and limited operating history
 the Company is particularly susceptible to adverse effects of changing economic conditions and consumer tastes
 competition
 and other contingencies or events beyond the control of the Company. It may be more difficult for the Company to prepare for and respond to these types of risks and the risks described elsewhere than for a company with an established business and operating cash flow.



We may not be able to adequately generate and adhere to the goals
 objectives
 strategies and tasks as defined in our business plan.

ANY FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE GENERAL LIABILITY
 COMMERCIAL
 AND SERVICE LIABILITY INSURANCE COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OF INCOME.

Any general
 commercial and/or service liability claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.



We will compete with many well-established companies such as FRS Healthy Energy
 ToGo Brands
 Clif Bar
 GU Energy Labs
 and EN-R-G Foods Inc. Indirect competitors include Red Bull
 Monster
 and 5-Hour Energy. Aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could reduce our revenue and profit margins.

LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY
 INITIAL OPERATING LOSSES.

The Company is presently a development stage Company with limited operating history and only nominal capital. Additionally
 though the Management Team has varied and extensive business backgrounds and technical expertise
 operations.&#160;&#160;Because of the limited operating history
 it is very difficult to evaluate the business and the future prospects. The Company will encounter risks and difficulties.&#160;&#160;If objectives are not achieved
 the Company may not realize sufficient revenues or net income to succeed.




The company anticipates using standard financing models and credit facilities.&#160;&#160;The Company may experience negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to meet the operating and investing cash requirements. The Company may not be able to find additional financing
 if required
 on favorable terms or at all. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity
 equity-related or debt securities
 these securities may have rights
 preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of the common stock holders who may experience additional dilution to their equity ownership.






















The Company will rapidly and significantly expand its operations and anticipates that significant expansion of its operations
 including administrative facilities
 will continue to be required in order to address potential market opportunities. The rapid growth will place
 and is expected to continue to place
 a significant strain on the Company&#8217;s management
 operational
 and financial resources. The Company's success is principally dependent on its current management personnel for the operation of its business.

THE COMPANY MUST HIRE EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL
 ACQUIRE EQUIPMENT AND EXPAND FACILITIES IN ANTICIPATION OF INCREASED BUSINESS.

The Company may not be able to hire or retain qualified staff. If qualified and skilled staff are not attracted and retained
 growth of the business may be limited. The ability to provide high quality service will depend on attracting and retaining educated staff
 as well as professional experiences that is relevant to our market
 including for marketing
 technology and general experience in (manufacturing energy supplements). There will be competition for personnel with these skill sets. Some technical job categories may experience severe shortages in the United States.



Rapid expansion strains infrastructure
 management
 internal controls and financial systems. The Company may not be able to effectively manage the growth or expansion. To support growth
 the Company plans to hire new employees. This growth may also strain the Company&#8217;s ability to integrate and properly train these new employees. Inadequate integration and training of employees may result in underutilization of the workforce and may reduce revenues or net income.


THE COMPANY MAY ACQUIRE OTHER BUSINESSES OR PRODCUTS SUITABLE FOR THE COMPANY&#8217;S PLANNED EXPANSION; IF THIS HAPPENS
 THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE EXISTING BUSINESS
 AND/OR MAY IMPAIR OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

If appropriate opportunities present themselves
 the Company may acquire businesses
 technologies
 services or products that are believed to be strategically viable. There are currently no understandings
 commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition
 aside from acquiring the necessary equipment to begin operations.



The Company operates in an environment of uncertainty as to potential government regulation via (energy supplement manufacturing).&#160;&#160;We believe that we are not subject to direct regulation
 other than regulations applicable to businesses generally. Laws and regulations may be introduced and court decisions may affect our business.&#160;&#160;Any future regulation may have a negative impact on the business by restricting the method of operation or imposing additional costs.


OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM&#8217;S REPORT CONTAINS AN EXPLANATORY PARAGHRAPH WHICH HAS EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN
 WHICH MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FUTURE FINANCING

April 16

 our independent registered public accounting firm stated that our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2012 were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern
 and that they have substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditors' doubts are based on our recurring net losses
 deficits in cash flows from operations and stockholders&#8217; deficiency. We continue to experience net operating losses. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources
 including by the sale of our securities
 or obtaining loans from financial institutions
 where possible. Our continued net operating losses and our auditors' doubts increase the difficulty of our meeting such goals and our efforts to continue as a going concern may not prove successful.


















One Million (1
000
000) shares of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series A&#8221;) are owned by Rick Darnell.&#160;&#160;Each share of Series A has one thousand (1
000) votes per share and votes with the common stock on all matters.&#160;&#160;The Series A voting separately as a class has the right to elect three persons to serve on the Company&#8217;s board of directors.&#160;&#160;As such
 the Series A has voting control of the Company and may use its majority voting control to affect the interests of the Company&#8217;s common stockholders.


On December 4
 2012
 the &#8220;Company reached an agreement with the holders of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock to surrender and cancel all outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock.&#160;&#160;A copy of the Acknowledgement of Surrender and Cancelation of the Series A Preferred Stock is attached as Exhibit 4.4 to the Form 8-k filed on December 4
 2012.&#160;&#160;The surrender and cancelation of the Series A Preferred Stock improves the Company&#8217;s capital structure because it eliminated the super voting provisions and conversion features that
 if exercised by the holders
 might dilute the common stockholders of the Company.



THE COMPANY&#8217;S SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DILUTE THE COMPANY&#8217;S COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AFTER DECEMBER 31
 2012.

The owners of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series A&#8221;) can elect to convert each share of Series A after December 31
 2012 into fifty (50) shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock if (i) the Company&#8217;s common stock is quoted for public trading in the United States or other international securities market and (ii) the Company's market capitalization (i.e.
 the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock multiplied by the daily closing price) has exceeded Fifty Million Dollars ($50
000
000) for 90 consecutive trading days.&#160;&#160;These provisions
 if exercised by the holders of the Series A
 may significantly dilute the Company&#8217;s common stockholders after December 31
 2012.



On December 4
 2012
 the &#8220;Company reached an agreement with the holders of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock to surrender and cancel all outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock.&#160;&#160;A copy of the Acknowledgement of Surrender and Cancelation of the Series A Preferred Stock is attached as Exhibit 4.4 to the Form 8-k filed on December 4
 2012.&#160;&#160;The surrender and cancelation of the Series A Preferred Stock improves the Company&#8217;s capital structure because it eliminated the super voting provisions and conversion features that
 if exercised by the holders
 might dilute the common stockholders of the Company.


 In addition to the above risks
 businesses are often subject to risks not foreseen or fully appreciated by management.

Item 5 &#8211; Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity
 Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities





Our common stock has the trading symbol LVVV.&#160;&#160;At present
 our common stock is not eligible for the clearing and custody services of the Depository Trust Company.&#160;&#160;We are working to correct this situation.&#160;&#160;On May 5th and 6th
 2011
 there were 105
000 shares of our common stock traded on the OTC market at prices between $.15 - $.20 per share.&#160;&#160;There has been no active trading in the Company's securities.&#160;&#160;As a result of the thin trading in the Company's stock
 the Company believes that the price at which the Company's stock may trade on a given day does not necessarily represent fair value.


*On September 20
 2011
 the Company changed its name and on October 7
 2011
 the Company&#8217;s common stock began trading under the symbol &#8220;LVVV&#8221;.


















FISCAL YEAR ENDED December 31

FISCAL YEAR ENDED December 31
 2011








































































































We had 88 stockholders of record of our common stock as of March 31
 2013
 including shares held in street name.



We have not paid any cash dividends to stockholders.&#160;&#160;The declaration&#160;&#160;of any future cash dividend&#160;&#160;will be at the discretion&#160;&#160;of our Board&#160;&#160;of Directors&#160;&#160;and will depend upon our earnings
&#160;&#160;if any
 our capital requirements&#160;&#160;and financial&#160;&#160;position
 general&#160;&#160;economic&#160;&#160;conditions&#160;&#160;and other pertinent factors. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future
 but rather to reinvest earnings
 if any
 into our business.






























The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future
 or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future.


We are engaged in the sale and marketing of energy chew products.&#160;&#160;Our product delivers a blend of ingredients that provides an energy boost similar to an energy drink
 such as Red Bull or 5-Hour Energy
 but is about the size of a Starburst candy.&#160;&#160;The product is not a gum; it dissolves quickly and is an alternative to drinks or shots.








The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets
 liabilities
 revenues
 and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various others assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Future events
 however
 may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions.&#160;&#160;While there are a number of significant accounting policies affecting our consolidated financial statements; we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most complex
 difficult and subjective estimates and judgments:


 &#8211; We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer&#8217;s inability to meet its financial obligations to us
 a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.


 &#8211; Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand
 production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences
 general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally
 management&#8217;s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate
 which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.


Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets
 including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets
 for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets
 then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management&#8217;s estimates of the business risks.


 &#8211; We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
Generally
 ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases
 ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors
 passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors
 relating to the costs associated with terminating our prior distributors
 are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement
 generally 20 years.


Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts
 returns and spoilage based on our historical experience.


 &#8211; Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products
 co-packing fees
 repacking fees
 in-bound freight charges
 as well as certain internal transfer costs
 warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales.


 &#8211; Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture
 as well as expenses for advertising
 commissions
 sampling and in-store demonstration costs
 costs for merchandise displays
 point-of-sale materials and premium items
 sponsorship expenses
 other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs
 travel costs
 professional service fees including legal fees
 entertainment
 insurance
 postage
 depreciation and other general and administrative costs.

















 &#8211; We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method
 deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances we consider projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets
 an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded
 decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made.


We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts
 circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained
 we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained
 no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.





The Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of December 31
 2012
 which consist of convertible instruments and rights to shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock
 and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for liability classification under ASC 815.


ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that
 if met
 require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract
 (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional
 as described.





Effective January 1
 2008
 the Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 or ASC 820
 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position or operating results
 but did expand certain disclosures.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally
 ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
































Unobservable inputs for which there is little no market data
 which require the use of the reporting entity&#8217;s own assumptions.




The Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of December 31
 2012
 with the exception of its convertible notes payable. The carrying amounts of these liabilities at December 31
 2012 approximate their respective fair value based on the Company&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate.

Cash is considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of December 31
 2012 and therefore classified as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy.

In addition
 FASB ASC 825-10-25 Fair Value Option
 or ASC 825-10-25
 was effective for January 1
 2008. ASC 825-10-25 expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments.





















Professional standards generally provides three criteria that
 if met
 require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)&#160;the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract
 (b)&#160;the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c)&#160;a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.&#160;&#160;Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as &#8220;The Meaning of &#8220;Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument&#8221;.

The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional standards when &#8220;Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features
&#8221; as those professional standards pertain to &#8220;Certain Convertible Instruments.&#8221; Accordingly
 the Company records
 when necessary
 discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.

ASC 815-40 provides that
 among other things
 generally
 if an event is not within the entity&#8217;s control could or require net cash settlement
 then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.

262
 respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2012 resulted from increases in salaries
 legal expenses
 accounting
 contract labor
 stock based compensation and office expenses.


During the year ended December 31
 2012 and 2011
 selling costs amounted to $69
930 and $10
266
 respectively.&#160;&#160;The increase in selling costs in 2012 resulted from increases in advertising expenses.


 During the year ended December 31
 2012 and 2011
 depreciation expense amounted to $6
022 and $3
900
 respectively. The increase in depreciation expense in 2012 resulted from purchase of equipment of $16
700
 offset with sale of equipment of $3
558.


 were $21
022 in 2012 compared to $2
381 during 2011. The primary increase is due to incurred increase in borrowings.&#160;

.&#160;As described in our accompanying consolidated financial statements
 we issued convertible notes with certain conversion features that have certain reset provisions.&#160;&#160;All of which
 we are required to bifurcate from the host financial instrument and mark to market each reporting period. We recorded the initial fair value of the reset provision as a liability with an offset to equity or debt discount and subsequently mark to market the reset provision liability at each reporting cycle.

For the year ended December 31
 2012
 we recorded a net loss of $10
977 in change in fair value of the derivative liability including initial non-cash interest&#160;as compared to $nil for the same period the previous year.




We have an accumulated deficit of $2
684
995 and our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $905
564 as of December 31
 2012. We may require additional funding to sustain our operations and satisfy our contractual obligations for our planned operations. Our ability to establish the Company as a going concern is may be dependent upon our ability to obtain additional funding in order to finance our planned operations.




During the year ended December 31
 2012
 our cash flows from operations were not sufficient for us to meet our operating commitments.&#160;&#160;Our cash flows from operations continue to be
 and are expected to continue to be
 insufficient to meet our operating commitments.


As of December 31
 2012
 we had a working capital deficit of $905
564 and cash of $2
110
 while at December 31
 2011 we had a working capital deficit of $790
440 and cash of $31
454. The increases in our working capital deficit are primarily attributable to our accounts payable
 notes payable
 derivative liability&#160;and advances from stockholders. We do not expect our working capital deficit to decrease in the near future.


Net cash used in or provided by operating
 investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

LiveWire Ergogenics
 Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LiveWire Ergogenics
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31
 2012
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholder&#8217;s deficiency
 and cash flows for the year ended December 31
 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

We have conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of LiveWire Ergogenics
 Inc. as of December 31
 2012
 and the results of their operation and their cash flow for the year ended December 31
 2012
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company has sustained substantial net losses and stockholders&#8217; deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

LiveWire MC2
 LLC (&#8220;LVWR&#8221;) was organized under the laws of the State of California on January 7
 2008 as a limited liability company. LVWR was formed for the purpose of developing and marketing consumable energy supplements. LVWR adopted December 31 as the fiscal year end.


On June 30
 2011
LVWR
 together with its members
 entered into a purchase agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;)
 for a share exchange with SF Blu Vu
 Inc.
 (&#8220;SF Blu&#8221;)
 a public Nevada shell corporation. SF Blu Vu Inc. was formed in Nevada on October 9
 2007 under the name Semper Flowers
 Inc. On May 15
 2009 the Company changed its name to SF Blu Vu
 Inc. The Purchase Agreement was ultimately completed on August 31
 2011. Under the terms of the purchase agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;)
 SF Blu issued 36
000
000 (30
000
000 shares pre stock split of 1 additional&#160;share for every five shares held) of their common shares for 100% of the members&#8217; interest in LVWR. Subsequent to the Purchase Agreement
 the members of LVWR owned 60% of common shares of SF Blu
 effectively obtaining operational and management control of SF Blu. For accounting purposes
 the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of business combinations
 and accordingly the transaction has been treated as a recapitalization of LVWR
 the accounting acquirer in this transaction
 with SF Blu (the shell) as the legal acquirer.


Subsequent to the Purchase Agreement the financial statements presented are those of LVWR
 as if the Purchase Agreement had been in effect retroactively for all periods presented. Immediately following completion of the&#160;Purchase Agreement
 LVWR and their stockholders had effective control of SF Blu even though SF Blu had acquired LVWR. For accounting purposes
 LVWR will be deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and
 consequently
 the transaction will be treated as a recapitalization of LVWR 
 a capital transaction involving the issuance of shares by SF Blu for the members&#8217; interest in LVWR. Accordingly
 the assets
 liabilities and results of operations of LVWR
&#160;became the historical financial statements of SF Blu at the closing of the Purchase Agreement
 and SF Blu&#8217;s assets
 liabilities and results of operations have been consolidated with those of LVWR commencing as of August 31
 2011
 the date the Purchase Agreement closed. SF Blu is considered the accounting acquiree
 or legal acquiror
 in this transaction. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill will be recorded in this transaction. As this transaction is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition
 all direct costs of the transaction have been charged to additional paid-in capital. All professional fees and other costs associated with transaction have been charged to additional paid-in-capital.


Subsequent to the Purchase Agreement being completed
 SF Blu as the legal acquiror and surviving company
 together with their controlling stockholders from LVWR changed the name of SF Blu to LiveWire Ergogenics
 Inc. (&#8220;LiveWire&#8221;) on September 20
 2011. Hereafter
 SF Blu
 LVWR
 or LiveWire are referred to as the &#8220;Company&#8221;
 unless specific reference is made to an individual entity.



















DECEMBER 31
 2012





In contemplation
 and in connection with the Purchase Agreement
 the Company&#8217;s directors on July 19
 2011 adopted resolutions determining the Designations
 Rights and Preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series A&#8221;) consisting of One Million (1
000
000) shares.&#160;&#160;The Series A is senior to the common stock and all other shares of Preferred Stock that may be later authorized.&#160;&#160;Each outstanding share of Series A has One Thousand (1
000) votes on all matters submitted to the stockholders and votes with the common stock on all matters.&#160;&#160;The Series A shares vote separately as a class has the right to elect three persons to serve on the board of directors.&#160;&#160;The shares of Series A (i) do not have a liquidation preference; (ii) do not accrue
 earn
 or participate in any dividends; (iii) are not subject to redemption by the Corporation; and (iv)&#160;each share of Series A has one thousand (1
000) votes per share and votes with the common stock on all matters.&#160;&#160;As such
 the Series A has voting control of the Company and may use its majority control to affect the interests of the Company&#8217;s common stockholders.


After December 31
 2012
 each outstanding share of Series A may be converted
 at the option of the owner
 into fifty (50) shares of the Company's common stock; provided however
 that no conversion shall be permitted unless (i) the Company's common stock is quoted for public trading in the United States or other international securities market and (ii) the Company's market capitalization (i.e.
 the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock multiplied by the daily closing price) has exceeded Fifty Million Dollars ($50
000
000) for 90 consecutive trading days. These provisions
 if executed by the holders of the Series A
 may significantly dilute the Company&#8217;s common stockholders after December 31
 2012.


On July 19
 2011
 the Company issued 1
000
000 shares of the newly created Series A to Weed &amp; Co. LLP
 (&#8220;Weed &amp; Co&#8221;) or its designee
 in exchange for a $100
000 reduction of the outstanding accounts payable
 being the equivalent of One Cent ($0.1) per share of Series A. Weed &amp; Co.
 had provided legal services to SF Blu as a shell prior to the Purchase Agreement
 and to the Company subsequent to the Purchase Agreement. Subsequent to the issuance of the Series A
 Weed &amp; Co assigned the Series A to a third party. On July 21
 2011 in connection with this Series A issuance
 a Contingent Option Agreement (&#8220;Contingent Option&#8221;) was entered into between the two primary members of LVWR and the holder of the issued Series A. Under the terms of this Contingent Option the holder of the Series A is not allowed to transfer
 sell or borrow against the Series A shares.&#160;&#160;Under the Contingent Option the two members of LVWR could purchase the issued Series A under the following circumstances:









Provided that LVWR becomes a subsidiary of a public entity any time prior to December 31
 2012
 the two members of LVWR could purchase the Series A for $400
000.






Provided that LVWR becomes a subsidiary of a public entity
 and that entity has not secured an investment of $350
000 prior to December 31
 2011 or March 31
 2012
 the two members of LVWR could purchase the Series A for $2.






Provided that LVWR becomes a subsidiary of a public entity
 and that entity has not secured an investment of $600
000 prior to June 30
 2012
 the two members of LVWR could purchase the Series A for $2.






Provided that LVWR becomes a subsidiary of a public entity
 and that entity has not secured an investment of $850
000 prior to December 31
 2012
 the two members of LVWR could purchase the Series A for $2.

























DECEMBER 31
 2012











Provided that LVWR becomes a subsidiary of a public entity
 and that entity reports cumulative gross revenue of $600
000 by June 30
 2012
 the two members of LVWR could purchase the Series A for $2.






Provided that LVWR becomes a subsidiary of a public entity
 and that entity reports cumulative gross revenue of $1
500
000 by December 31
 2012
 the two members of LVWR could purchase the Series A for $2.






Provided that LVWR becomes a subsidiary of a public entity
 and that entity secures funding in excess of $200
000 through the efforts of the two members
 then the two members of LVWR could purchase the Series A for $2.





Based on the above noted terms of the Contingent Option the Company accounted for the issued Series A
 similar to that of the 36
000
000 (30
000
000 shares pre stock split of 1 additional&#160;share for every five shares held) shares of common stock issued with the Purchase Agreement
 as the terms of the Contingent Option are effectively made to ensure that the Series A
 and any benefit there under
 would ultimately reside with the LVWR members. Accordingly
 the Series A are treated as having been issued by the accounting acquirer
 or LVWR
 since inception for all periods presented.


In March 2012
 Bill Hodson and Brad Nichols exercised their rights under the Contingent Option Agreement dated July 21
 2011 with Rick Darnell. Based upon the Agreement and fulfillment of contingencies in the Agreement
 Bill Hodson and Brad Nichols each acquired 500
000 shares of the Series A from Rick Darnell for $2.00.



On December 4
 2012
 the &#8220;Company reached an agreement with the holders of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock to surrender and cancel all outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock.&#160;&#160;A copy of the Acknowledgement of Surrender and Cancelation of the Series A Preferred Stock is attached as Exhibit 4.4 to the Form 8-k filed on December 4
 2012.&#160;&#160;The surrender and cancelation of the Series A Preferred Stock improves the Company&#8217;s capital structure because it eliminated the super voting provisions and conversion features that
 if exercised by the holders
 might dilute the common stockholders of the Company.









Advertising is expensed as incurred and is included in selling costs on the accompanying statements of operations. Advertising and marketing expense for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011 was approximately $70
000 and $7
000
 respectively.





















DECEMBER 31
 2012








Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances
 the Company considers many factors
 including the age of the balance
 a customer&#8217;s historical payment history
 its current credit-worthiness and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection. At December 31
 2012 and 2011
 the Company has established
 based on a review of its outstanding balances
 an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of $23
583 and $6
732
 respectively.





These consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the basis of accounting generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements and with Form 10-K and article 8 of the Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). Under this basis of accounting
 revenues are recorded as earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred.





The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original&#160;maturity of three months or less and money market accounts to be cash equivalents.&#160;&#160;There were no cash equivalents at December 31
 2012 and 2011.





The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.&#160;&#160;Actual results could differ from those estimates.




The Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of December 31
 2012
 which consist of convertible instruments and rights to shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock
 and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for liability classification under ASC 815.

ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that
 if met
 require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract
 (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional
 as described.

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the FIFO method.&#160;&#160;Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and packaging materials and production supplies
 i.e.
 packaged consumable energy supplements
&#160;manufactured under contract
 and the wrappers and containers they are sold in. A periodic inventory system is maintained by 100% count.&#160;Inventory is replaced periodically to maintain the optimum stock on hand available for immediate shipment.&#160;&#160;





Effective January 1
 2008
 the Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 or ASC 820
 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position or operating results
 but did expand certain disclosures.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally
 ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
































Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data
 which require the use of the reporting entity&#8217;s own assumptions.




The Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of December 31
 2012
 with the exception of its convertible notes payable. The carrying amounts of these liabilities at December 31
 2012 approximate their respective fair value based on the Company&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate.

Cash is considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of December 31
 2012 and therefore classified as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy.

In addition
 FASB ASC 825-10-25 Fair Value Option
 or ASC 825-10-25
 was effective for January 1
 2008. ASC 825-10-25 expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments.






Professional standards generally provides three criteria that
 if met
 require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)&#160;the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract
 (b)&#160;the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c)&#160;a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.&#160;&#160;Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as &#8220;The Meaning of &#8220;Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument&#8221;.


The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional standards when &#8220;Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features
&#8221; as those professional standards pertain to &#8220;Certain Convertible Instruments.&#8221; Accordingly
 the Company records
 when necessary
 discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.

ASC 815-40 provides that
 among other things
 generally
 if an event is not within the entity&#8217;s control could or require net cash settlement
 then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.




Prior to the Purchase Agreement LVWR was taxed as a limited liability company
 which is a &#8216;pass through entity&#8217; for tax purposes. Taxable income flowed through to its members
 and income taxes were not levied at the company level. Subsequent to the reverse merger LVWR became a subsidiary of the SF Blu and is taxed at the Company&#8217;s marginal corporate rate. The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Section 740-10-30
 which is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in their financial statements or tax returns.

We account for the grant of stock options and restricted stock awards in accordance with ASC 718
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation.&#8221; ASC 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation.




Sales are recorded at the time title of goods sold passes to customers
 which based on shipping terms which generally occurs when the product is shipped to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. Based on prior experience
 the Company reasonably estimates its sales returns and warranty reserves. Sales are presented net of discounts and allowances. Discounts and allowances are determined when a sale is negotiated. The Company does not grant price adjustments after a sale is complete.&#160;&#160;The Company warrants its products sold on the internet with a right of exchange by means of an approved Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA).&#160;&#160;Returns of unused merchandise are similarly authorized. Warranty and return policy for product sold through retail distribution channels is negotiated with each customer.







Shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold and totaled $18
827 and $13
084 for the year ended December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.





The Company utilizes the guidance per FASB Codification &#8220;ASC 260 Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is calculated on the weighted effect of all common shares issued and outstanding
 and is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
 which is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation
 plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding
 is not presented separately as it is anti-dilutive. Such securities
 shown below
 presented on a common share equivalent basis and outstanding as of December 31
 2012 and 2011 have been excluded from the per share computations:

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10
 Property
 Plant and Equipment (&#8220;ASC 360-10&#8221;). ASC 360-10 requires those long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions
 recurring losses
 or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated
 the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted
 based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.










A variety of accounting standards have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date. We regularly review all new pronouncements that have been issued since the filing of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31
 2011 to determine their impact
 if any
 on our consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of any of these standards to have a material impact once adopted.

The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.&#160;&#160;The Company has a net loss of $1
702
803 for the year ended December 31
 2012
 and has an accumulated deficit of $2
684
995 as of December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;The Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.&#160;&#160;If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital
 it could be forced to cease development of operations.


In order to continue as a going concern
 develop a reliable source of revenues
 and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need
 among other things
 additional capital resources.&#160;&#160;Management&#8217;s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares.&#160;&#160;However
 management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations.&#160;&#160;The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated using straight line methods over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three to five years.&#160;&#160;Maintenance and repairs are expensed currently. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred.&#160;&#160;Major overhaul that extends the useful life of existing assets is capitalized.&#160;&#160;When equipment is retired or disposed
 the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the resulting profit or loss is recognized in income.

ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value
 the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability
 such as inherent risk
 transfer restrictions
 and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:&#160;







To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market
 the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases
 the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases
 for disclosure purposes
 the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

 2012.&#160;&#160;The surrender and cancelation of the Series A Preferred Stock improves the Company&#8217;s capital structure because it eliminated the super voting provisions and conversion features that
 if exercised by the holders
 might dilute the common stockholders of the Company.

The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740
 &#8220;Expenses &#8211; Income Taxes&#8221;. ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities
 and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets.

Through June 30
 2011 LVWR was a limited liability company that operated out of the State of California.&#160;&#160;Tax returns were filed as a partnership
 which is a &#8216;pass through entity&#8217; for tax purposes.&#160;&#160;Taxable income flowed through to members
 and income taxes were not imposed at the company level
 except in special circumstances.&#160;The State of California imposes a minimal franchise tax on gross income. LVWR did not accumulate net operating losses or deferred tax assets/liabilities. Subsequent to the Purchase Agreement on June 30
 2011 LVWR operations are consolidated with those of SF Blu
 a Nevada corporation
 which is subject to both Federal and State income taxes.

Had the Company been taxed as a corporation it would have resulted in deferred tax assets for both Federal and State tax purposes due to the Company having experienced losses during the period immediately prior to the reverse merger on June 30
 2011 and for the year ended December 31
 2010. In addition
 had these deferred tax assets been recorded they would have been fully reserved
 as the Company has not achieved profitable operations since its inception
 and management would not be able to determine if it was more likely than not if those deferred tax assets would be realized in future periods.

Subsequent to the reverse merger on June 30
 2011 the Company has assumed the net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carry forward of SF Blu. Management estimates the NOL as of December 31
 2011 to be approximately&#160;$127
000
 inclusive of operation subsequent to the reverse merger. This NOL will be expiring through the year 2031. The utilization of the Company&#8217;s NOL may be limited because of a possible change in ownership as defined under Section 382 of Internal Revenue Code. Such change in ownership
 for purposes of utilization of the Company&#8217;s NOL&#8217;s under Section 382
 may have occurred with the reverse merger that was entered into on June 30
 2011.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Included in the deferred tax asset is the aforementioned NOL. The Company is not able to predict if such future taxable income will be more likely than not sufficient to utilize the benefit. As such
 the Company does not believe the benefit is more likely than not to be realized and they have recognized a full valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures
 and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls
 the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.





Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2012 using the criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).


A material weakness is a deficiency
 or combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2012
 we determined that control deficiencies existed that constituted material weaknesses
 as described below:




















































there is no policy on fraud and no code of ethics at this time
 though we plan to implement such policies in fiscal 2012; and













There is no effective separation of duties
 which includes monitoring controls
 between the members of management.








Accordingly
 we concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company's internal controls.


As a result of the material weaknesses described above
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2012 based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by COSO.























During the fiscal year ended December 31
 2012
 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 and researched companies he felt had potential based on their development pipeline. Many companies were pre-human clinical trial stage. He also produced a daily newsletter reporting on developments within the biotechnology index. Hodson created and hosted the Newport Beach Biotechnology Conference
 where he invited several companies to present to a group of his firms&#8217; clients and invited guests.

 executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors. We do not have an audit committee &#8220;financial expert.&#8221; Our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee and handles matters related to compensation and nominations of directors.



Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors.



We are not subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or national securities association and
 as a result
 we are not at this time required to have our board comprised of a majority of &#8220;independent directors.&#8221; Our determination of independence of directors is made using the definition of &#8220;independent director&#8221; contained in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market (&#8220;NASDAQ&#8221;) 
 even though such definitions do not currently apply to us because we are not listed on NASDAQ. We have determined that none of our directors currently meet the definition of &#8220;independent&#8221; as within the meaning of such rules.



We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless
 every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors
 as applicable
 and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications
 and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year
 our Board will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process.



We have adopted a Code of Ethics within the meaning of Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Code of Ethics applies to directors and senior officers
 such as the principal executive officer
 principal financial officer
 controller
 and persons performing similar functions.
