 respectively. Our commitment to producing the highest quality beers is a key part of our heritage and remains so to this day. Our brands are designed to appeal to a wide range of consumer tastes
 styles and price preferences. Our largest markets are the U.S.
Coors was incorporated in June 1913 under the laws of the state of Colorado. In October 2003
 Coors merged with and into Adolph Coors Company
 a Delaware corporation. In February 2005
 Adolph Coors Company merged with Molson Inc. (the Merger). Upon completion of the Merger
 Adolph Coors Company changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company. In January 2020
 we changed our name from Molson Coors Brewing Company to Molson Coors Beverage Company
On October 28
 2019
 we initiated a revitalization plan designed to allow us to invest across our portfolio to drive long-term
 sustainable success. As part of our revitalization plan
 we made the determination to establish Chicago
 Illinois as our North American operational headquarters
 close our existing office in Denver
Effective January 2020
 we moved from a corporate center and four business units to two business units - North America and Europe. The North America business unit consolidates the United States
 Canada and corporate center
 enabling us to move more quickly with an integrated portfolio strategy. The Europe business unit allows for standalone operations

The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years
 becoming an increasingly global beer market. The industry was previously founded on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export
 license and partnership arrangements. More recently
 it has become increasingly complex
 as the consolidation of brewers has occurred globally
 resulting in fewer major global market participants. In addition to the acquisitive element of this industry consolidation
 the market continues to utilize export
 license and partnership arrangements; however
 these are often with the same global competitors that make up the majority of the market. This industry consolidation has resulted in a small number of large global brewers representing the majority of the worldwide beer market. At the same time
 smaller local brewers within certain established markets are experiencing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on&#160;locally-produced
 regionally-sourced products.&#160;Changing consumer trends are also pushing the industry toward above premium beer
 flavored malt beverages
 and beyond beer altogether. As the beer industry continues its evolution of consolidation and diversification of its products to meet consumer demand with broadening preferences
 large global brewers are uniquely positioned to leverage the scale
We evaluate ourselves in relation to other global brewers using various metrics
 including overall market capitalization
 volume
 net sales revenue
 gross margins and net profits
 as well as our position within each of our core markets
 with the goal to be the first choice for our consumers and customers. To provide a perspective of the relative size of the major participants in the global brewing market

The global beer industry and the broader alcohol industry are constantly evolving
 and our position within the global beer industry and our markets in which we operate may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with evolving industry and market dynamics
The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly global beer market. For many years
 the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export
 license and partnership arrangements. In contrast
 it has now become increasingly complex as the global consolidation of brewers has resulted in fewer major market participants. At the same time
 smaller local brewers within certain geographies are seeing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on&#160;locally-produced and/or regionally-sourced products.&#160;As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants
 the markets in which we operate
 particularly the more mature markets
 may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position and local governments may intervene
 which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example
 the North American beer markets have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market.&#160;However
 evolution in these markets and our other beer markets
 together with emerging changes to consumer preferences
 have introduced a significant increase in market entrants and resulted in increased consumer choice and market competition
 as well as increased government scrutiny.&#160;Specifically
 our U.S.
 Canada and Europe markets have experienced vast expansion in the craft beer industry along with the expansion of cider
 flavored malt beverages (including hard seltzers)
 and other wellness beverages. If our competitors are able to respond more quickly to the evolving trends within the craft beer
 cider
 hard seltzer
 flavored malt beverages and other wellness beverages categories
 or if our new products are not successful
 our business and financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition
 certain states in the U.S. have passed or are considering passing
 and Canada has passed
 laws and regulations that allow the sale and distribution of cannabis. Currently
 it is not possible to predict the impact of this on sales of alcoholic beverages but it is possible that legal cannabis usage could adversely impact the demand for our products. Furthermore
 imported beers also continue to compete aggressively in the U.S. In Canada
 changes to interprovincial trade rules
 regulations
 distribution models
 and packaging requirements
 such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles
 may be disadvantageous to us.&#160;Currently
 in Ontario and other provinces
We also compete generally with other alcoholic beverages. We compete with other beer and beverage companies not only for drinker acceptance and loyalty
 but also for shelf
 cold box and tap space in retail establishments and for marketing focus by our distributors and their customers
In addition
 the broader alcohol industry is experiencing a rapid shift in drinking preferences and behaviors. We believe this has been driven by a generational demographic shift away from beer in particular towards other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. As discussed above
 even within the beer industry we have seen a shift away from the traditionally most popular beer brands and segments and a corresponding expansion in the craft beer industry along with the expansion of cider
 hard seltzers
 flavored malt beverages and other wellness beverages. Accordingly
 we have initiated our revitalization plan
 pursuant to which we will strive to achieve more consistent topline growth by expanding beyond beer and into adjacent beverage categories. However
 if we are unsuccessful in evolving with
 and navigating through
 the changes to the markets in which we operate
Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many of our markets
 our primary competitors have greater financial
 marketing
 production and distribution resources than we do
 and may be more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate
 aggressive marketing strategies
 such as reduced pricing
 brand positioning
 and increased capital or other investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition
 continuing consolidation among major global brewers and between brewers and other beverage companies may lead to stronger or new competitors
 loss of partner brands
 negative impacts on our distributor networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further
 consolidation of distributors in our industry could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the markets in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes our brands' value
 as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively and efficiently. Additionally
 due to competition with brewers and other beverage companies
 an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial results and market share. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability. Increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets
 as well as the need for increased capital investment
 marketing and other expenditures could result in lower margins or loss of market share and volumes. Moreover
 most of our major markets are mature
 so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our global competitors. For example
Our success as an enterprise currently depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products
 consumption of our products decline or we are unable to successfully and timely innovate beyond beer
 brands in the U.S.
Coors Light
 Molson Canadian
 brands in Canada
Carling
 Staropramen
 Jelen
. Additionally
 several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market
 therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently
 any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands
 or from the categories in which they compete
 could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to
 among others
 changing taste preferences
 demographics
 downturn in economic conditions or perceived value
 as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity
 regulatory actions or litigation. Recently
 there has been more attention focused on health concerns and the harmful effects of alcoholic beverages which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages which could materially impact the consumption of beer and our sales. Additionally
 in some of our major markets
 specifically the U.S.
 Canada and Europe
 there has been a shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to craft beer produced by smaller
 regional microbreweries
 as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. More recently
 the rapid growth of hard seltzers in the U.S. may have shifted some consumers away from our brands and beer generally. Moreover
 several of our major markets are mature and we have a significant share in such markets
 therefore
 small movements in consumer preference
 such as consumer shifts away from premium light brands
 can also disproportionately impact our results. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown
 the emergence of legal cannabis in certain U.S. states and Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer. As a result
Furthermore
 as part of our revitalization plan
 our future topline growth will depend
 in part
 on our ability to timely innovate and develop new products beyond traditional beer. In connection with our revitalization plan
 we plan to innovate
 test and scale products faster than we have before. However
 the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain
unsuccessful launch or short-lived popularity of our product innovations could
 among other things
 affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation as well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs. Our inability to attract consumers to our product innovations relative to our competitors&#8217; products
 especially over time
 could negatively affect our growth
 business
The success of our business relies heavily on brand image
 reputation
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing brands and products. Concerns about product quality
 even when unsubstantiated
 could be harmful to our image and the reputation of our brands and products. While we have quality control programs in place
 in the event we or our third-party manufacturers experienced an issue with product quality or if any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption
 are misbranded or cause injury
 we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact brand image and reputation
 negatively affect our sales and cause us to incur additional costs. A widespread product recall
 multiple product recalls or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period
 which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity. Our brand image and reputation may also be more difficult to protect due to less oversight and control as a result of the outsourcing of some of our operations. We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability
 marketing or sales practices or intellectual property infringement. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition
 because our brands carry family names
 personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could also have an adverse effect on our brands. Further
 our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights
 including trademarks
 patents
 domain names
We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights or that other parties may claim that our brands infringe on their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights
Weak
 or weakening of
 economic or other negative conditions in the markets in which we do business
 including reductions in discretionary consumer spending
    Beer consumption in many of our markets is closely tied to general economic conditions and a significant portion of our portfolio consists of premium and above premium brands. Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets
 such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation
 income taxes
 the cost of living
 unemployment levels
 political or economic instability or other country-specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example
 a trend towards value brands in certain of our markets or deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales revenues are concentrated in the U.S. Therefore
 unfavorable macroeconomic conditions
 such as a recession or slowed economic growth
 in the U.S. could negatively affect consumer demand for our product in this important market. Under difficult economic conditions
 consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our products to lower-priced products offered by other companies. Softer consumer demand for our products
 particularly in the U.S.
Our restructuring activities related to our revitalization plan may not be successful and the estimated costs associated with such activities may be more than expected
    On October 28
 2019
 as part of the revitalization plan
 we made the determination to establish Chicago
 Illinois as our North American operational headquarters
 close our existing office in Denver
 Colorado and consolidate certain administrative functions into our other existing office locations. In connection with these consolidation activities
 we expect to incur certain cash and non-cash restructuring charges related to employee relocation
 severance
 retention and transition costs
 non-cash asset related costs
 lease exit costs in connection with office leases in Denver
 Colorado
 in the aggregate
 the majority of which will be cash charges that we began recognizing in the fourth quarter of 2019
 and will be further spread through the balance of fiscal years 2020 and 2021.&#160;In 2019
 related to this estimated range
 remained accrued as of December 31
 2019. These expenses will adversely impact our results of operations during the relevant periods and will reduce our cash position. Additionally
 the amount of these estimated expenses
 as well as our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings
 revitalization plan goals and other benefits of our restructuring activities
 are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties. We may also experience additional costs in connection with these restructuring activities due to delays or other unforeseen circumstances.&#160;There is no assurance that we will successfully implement
 or fully realize the anticipated costs and other benefits of our restructuring activities or execute successfully on our restructuring plan
 in the time frames we desire or at all.&#160;If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits
 including ongoing cost savings
 or if we incur charges or costs in amounts that are greater than anticipated
 our business
In addition
 in connection with the announcement that we plan to consolidate our office locations
 we have experienced attrition in our workforce. As a result
 we will be required to hire and train new employees to replace certain employees who were affected by our restructuring activities. The increased turnover in our employees could distract management and others from the operation of our business and make it more difficult to retain and hire new talent. The turnover and any resulting distraction could also negatively impact the overall performance of our employees
 resulting in inefficiencies
 higher short- or long-term costs
 or decreased productivity. As a result of these or other similar risks
 our business
 plans
 strategies
Our significant debt level subjects us to financial and operating risks
Our indebtedness subjects us to various financial and operating covenants
 including
 but not limited to
 restrictions on priority indebtedness
 leverage thresholds
 liens
 certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets
 each of which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement
 we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings
 may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness
 and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Our significant debt level and the terms of such debt could
limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us
limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions
execute our revitalization plan
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;debt
 thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions
 working capital
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;activities
limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital
 capital expenditures
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;opportunities
 including acquisitions or other investments
 to fund growth or for general corporate purposes
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity
In addition
 certain of our current and future debt and derivative financial instruments have or
 in the future
 could have interest rates that are tied to reference interest rates
 such as the LIBOR. The volatility and availability of such reference rates are out of our control. Accordingly
 changes to or the unavailability of such rates
 could result in increases to the cost of debt which would negatively affect our profitability. For example
 in 2017
 the UK&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR
 and it is unclear whether the banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021. At this time
 it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance
 modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate
 or the establishment of alternative reference rates will have on us. However
 should LIBOR no longer be available or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form
 our borrowing costs could increase
 which would negatively affect our profitability
 and the attractiveness of borrowings under our current credit facility or future debt issuances could diminish
Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. While we have publicly expressed our intention to maintain an investment grade debt rating
 ratings are determined by third-party rating agencies. A credit ratings downgrade
 particularly a downgrade below investment grade
Default by
 or failure of
As part of our risk management activities
 we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments
 including
 among others
 forward contracts
 commodity swap contracts
 option contracts
 with various financial institutions. In addition
 we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As a result
 we are exposed to the risk of default by
 or failure of
 counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy
Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials
 some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties
 to produce our products
 including barley
 malted barley
 hops
 corn
 other various starches
 water and packaging materials
 including aluminum cans and bottles
 glass and polyethylene terephthalate containers
 as well as
 cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel
 natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control
 including market demand
 alternative sources for suppliers
 global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices)
 trade agreements among producing and consuming nations
 governmental regulations
 including tariffs
 frosts
 droughts and other weather conditions
 changes in precipitation patterns
 the frequency of extreme weather events
 economic factors affecting growth decisions
 inflation
 plant diseases
 theft and industry surcharges and other practices. For example
 in June 2018
 U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada
 Mexico and EU went into effect (though the U.S. lifted the aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in May 2019)
 which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. In addition
 our North America business unit is exposed to variability in the market price of a regional premium differential (referred to as &#8220;Midwest Premium&#8221; in the U.S.) charged by industry participants to deliver aluminum from the smelter to the manufacturing facility. This premium differential also fluctuates in relation to several conditions
 including based on the supply of and demand for aluminum in a particular region
 associated transportation costs and warehouse financing transactions
 which limit the amount of physical aluminum available to consumers and increases the price differential as a result. During times of greater volatility in the Midwest Premium
 the variability in our cost of goods sold can also increase. In addition to impacting the price we pay for the raw materials we purchase
 changing premium differentials impact our end consumers as we must either pass on the increased cost to those consumers or experience a decrease in our profit margins as a result of the Midwest Premium differential. Increases in the Midwest Premium
 or the inability to pass through any fluctuation in aluminum prices or regional premiums to our end consumers
 could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and cash flow. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the availability or prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers
We are from time to time involved in or subject to legal or regulatory proceedings related to our business. Such proceedings can be complex
 costly
 and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of such proceedings
 including our potential liability
 if any
 is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The outcome of litigation
 arbitration
 regulatory or other proceedings
 including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement
 may differ materially from management&#8217;s outlook or estimates
 including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes
 including judgments
 awards
 settlements or orders
 could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 operating results
&#160;   In connection with various business combinations
 we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. For example
 as a result of the Acquisition
 we allocated approximately $6.3 billion and $7.6 billion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
 respectively. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually
 using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally
 in conjunction with the brand impairment tests
 we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible
 as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible
 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example
reporting unit at the end of the third quarter of 2019
 recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the third quarter of 2019. Furthermore
 in the fourth quarter of 2016
Our most recent impairment analysis
October&#160;1
 2019
 the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter
 indicated that the fair value of the U.S.
 Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 
 in excess of their carrying values
 respectively. In the current year testing
 it was determined that the fair value of the U.S. and Canada reporting units declined during the year
 while there was a slight increase in the fair value of the Europe reporting unit versus the prior year. As a result of our testing
 the Europe and Canada reporting units continue to be considered at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged weakening of economic conditions
 or significant unfavorable changes in tax
 environmental or other regulations
 including interpretations thereof)
 terminal growth rates
 in excess of its carrying value as of the impairment testing date. Although the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are either equal to or in excess of their carrying values
 the fair values are sensitive to the aforementioned potential unfavorable changes that could have an adverse impact on future analyses. Any future impairment of the U.S.
 Europe or Canada reporting units or brands
 or reclassification of indefinite-lived brands to definite-lived
 may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results
 as evidenced by the charges incurred during the third quarter of 2019 and fourth quarter of 2016
 as previously noted above. The testing of our goodwill for impairment is also predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test.

Note 10
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture
 licensing
 distribution
 contract brewing or other similar arrangements
 such as our agreement to import
 market
 distribute and sell certain Heineken brands in Canada
 our arrangements with ABI to brew and distribute 
 
 
 
 into the U.S. under perpetual royalty-free license. These agreements have varying expiration dates and performance criteria
 with several agreements approaching expiration in the near future. Non-renewal of these agreements or loss of one more or more of these arrangements
 because of failure of performance
 failure to come to terms on a negotiated extension
 as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We purchase certain types of packaging materials
 including aluminum cans and bottles
 glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally
 if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers&#8217; financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control
 including: competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes
 work stoppages
    We have entered into several joint ventures
 including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation (i.e. Rocky Mountain Metal Container)
 and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc. (i.e. Rocky Mountain Bottle Company)
 for a portion of our aluminum and glass packaging supply in the U.S. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic
 business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition
 we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us
 among other matters
 to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition
 our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents
We expect our operations in developing and emerging markets to become more significant to our operating results as we continue to further expand internationally
 including in connection with our acquisition of the Miller International Business. In certain of these markets
 we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section
 our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks
 including: changes in local political
 economic
 social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment
 which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles
 increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance
 language
In addition
 as a global company
 we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption
 including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties
 criminal sanctions against us
 our officers
 or our employees
 prohibitions on the conduct of our business and prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries
 each of which could have a materially negative effect on our reputation
 brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations
 including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act
 there can be no assurance that our employees
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed
 it could alter our business practices and have material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example
 in the U.S. market
 there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system
 consisting of required separation of manufacturers
 distributors and retailers
 dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and allow changes to the three-tier system
 such changes could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. segment results of operations. Further
 in Canada
 our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally
 in certain Canadian provinces
 we rely on our joint venture arrangements
 such as BRI and BDL
 to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets
 known as The Beer Store
 in Ontario
 and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the western Canadian provinces. If provincial regulation should change
Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
 most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as
 Euro
 British Pound
 Czech Koruna
 Croatian Kuna
 Serbian Dinar
 New Romanian Leu
We hold assets and incur liabilities
 earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies
 most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in USD
 we must translate our assets
 liabilities
 income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect
 perhaps adversely
 the value of these items in our financial statements
 even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally
 we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities
 such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures
 as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further
 certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and  financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements
 which may affect our operations
effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates
 our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example
 as a result of the U.K. vote in 2016 to leave the European Union
 the GBP experienced a significant decline in comparison to USD and EUR and may continue to be volatile. Any significant further weakening of the GBP to the USD
 including in connection with the uncertainty regarding the future trade agreements following the U.K.'s exit from the European Union
 will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance and relative magnitude of U.K. sales. Additionally
 the strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar
Changes in tax
 environmental
 trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our business is highly regulated by national
 state
 provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs
 licensing requirements
 trade and pricing practices
 labeling
 advertising
 promotion and marketing practices
 relationships with distributors
 environmental matters
 ingredient regulations
 and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation
 varying interpretations and political debate and inquiries from government regulators charged with their enforcement
For example
 on December 22
 2017
 the 2017 Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. This enactment resulted in a number of significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law for U.S. corporations. Most notably
 the statutory federal corporate income tax rate was changed from 35% to 21% for corporations and
 as a result
 in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by the effects of the 2017 Tax Act on our deferred tax positions as of December 31
 2017. Additionally
 since 2018
 the U.S. Department of Treasury has continued to issue proposed
 temporary and final regulations to implement provisions of the 2017 Tax Act.&#160;We have continued to monitor these and while temporary and final regulations have not yet resulted in material adverse impacts to us
 there are certain proposed regulations
 which are not yet considered law
 that if finalized as proposed
 could result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Specifically
 if certain of the proposed regulations are finalized as proposed with full retroactive application to January 1
 2018
 then we would be required to recognize estimated income tax expense of approximately $100 million to $200 million upon enactment related to the proposed retroactive period through December 31
 2019
 for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.&#160;This estimated range contains significant uncertainty and could be impacted by various factors
 including any differences between the proposed and ultimately finalized regulations. Separately
 in December 2018
 the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a regulation that impacts our ability to claim a refund of certain federal duties
 taxes
 and fees paid for beer sold between the U.S. and certain other countries effective as of February 2019
 and
 as a result
 based on the terms of the regulation
 it is the U.S Department of Treasury's view that future claims will no longer be accepted
 and further
 in historically claimed
 but not yet received
 refunds
 which would negatively impact our revenue. In January 2020
 the United States Court of International Trade issued an opinion and order ruling the challenged portions of this regulation dealing with refunds of certain federal duties
 taxes and fees paid with respect to certain imported beer
 to the extent of certain exported beer
 to be unlawful. The U.S. Department of Treasury has until February 18
Additionally
 modifications of U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment
 including trade agreements and tariffs such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (a new trade agreement between the U.S. government and the Canadian and Mexican governments which will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement when ratified)
 or aluminum tariffs
 could adversely affect our supply chain
 business and results of operations.&#160;For example
 in June 2018
 U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada
 Mexico and EU went into effect (though the U.S. lifted the aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in May 2019)
 which has created volatility in the price of aluminum in the U.S. and increased the price of aluminum used in some of our product packaging. Continued imposition of U.S. aluminum tariffs
 the implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials
Furthermore
 various jurisdictions have adopted
 or may seek to adopt
 additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our beverages relating to perceived adverse health consequences of some of our beverages. If additional or more severe requirements of this type are imposed on one or more of our beverages under current or future laws or regulations
 they could inhibit sales of such beverages in such jurisdictions. In addition
 we cannot predict whether our beverages will become subject to increased rules and regulations regarding labeling or warnings which
 if enacted
Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws
 regulations
 or interpretations thereof
 or in tax
 environmental
 excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss
 revocation or suspension of our licenses
 permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations. Additionally
 uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of
 and potential future developments in
 complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations
 the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions.&#160;Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements
 differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made
 or future changes to such assumptions
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our business depends
 in large part
 upon agricultural activity and natural resources. There is concern that carbon monoxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global average temperatures
 which could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns and more volatile weather conditions could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may impact quality
 limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities
 such as hops
 barley and other cereal grains
 which are important ingredients for our products. Furthermore
 should weather patterns in our markets shift from warm or high temperatures to unseasonably cool or wet weather
 consumption of our products may decline
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities
 disrupt our supply chain
 distribution networks and routes to market
 or impact demand for our products. In addition
 public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy
Concern over climate change may result in new or increased regional
 federal and global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases
 or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency and water conservation
 we may experience disruptions in
 or increases in our costs of
 operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional investments in facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular
 increasing regulation of fuel emissions could increase the cost of energy
 including fuel
 required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products
 thereby increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result
 the effects of climate change or water scarcity could negatively affect our business and operations. In addition
 any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment or to effectively respond to new
 or changes in
 legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or water scarcity could result in adverse publicity and could adversely affect our business
 reputation
 financial condition or results of operations. There is also increased focus
 including by governmental and non-governmental organizations
 investors
 customers and consumers on these and other environmental sustainability matters
 including deforestation
 land use
 climate impact and water use. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act
 or are perceived not to act
An inadequate supply or availability or quality water could have a material adverse effect on
 among other things
 our sales
 production processes
 other costs and
 in turn
Quality water is a key ingredient in our brewing process. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic
 agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available
 water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. Further
 unavailability of clean water at our breweries could limit our ability to brew
We and our suppliers are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries and key facilities and the key facilities of our significant suppliers. The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their fields. A substantial reduction in water in certain agricultural areas could result in material losses of crops
 such as barley or hops
 which could lead to a shortage of our product supply. If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates
Loss
 operational disruptions or closure of a major brewery or other key facility
 due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise
Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes
 hurricanes
 floods
 terror attacks and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. If any of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss
 it could delay or disrupt production
 shipments and revenue
Additionally
 certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies
 which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Furthermore
 our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity
 including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further
 significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines
 could result in under-utilization of our assets
 which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example
 as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network
 certain breweries and bottling lines were closed in recent years
 and we have and continue to incur brewery closure costs
Failure to successfully identify
We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several strategic joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry
 we anticipate that we may
 from time to time
 in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business such as the Acquisition and our Canadian business' joint venture with HEXO and the various other craft acquisitions we have made recently. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include
 among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating
 recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards
 controls
 procedures and policies
 business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales
Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors
 such as the rates of return on the plans' assets
 discount rates
 the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans
 exchange rate fluctuations
 government regulation
 court rulings or other changes in legal requirements
 global equity prices
 and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements
 we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations which exceed the value of the plans' assets. These funding requirements also may require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets
 and depending upon the other factors as listed above
 we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows
 credit rating
 cost of borrowing
 financial position and/or results of operations. For example
 following the completion of the triennial review of the U.K. pension plan with the plan's trustees in 2014
 we made a GBP 150 million contribution to our U.K. pension plan in January 2015
 based on the underfunded status of the plan and the evaluation of the plan's performance and long-term obligations. In addition
 we made pension plan contributions during 2017 of approximately $310 million
We depend on key personnel
The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify
 attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price
 our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition
 we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization
 or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition
 in order to achieve our operating objectives
Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in Canada
 Europe
 and the U.S.
 we could be significantly affected by labor strikes
December&#160;31
 2019
 approximately 45%
 35%
 and 30% of our Canadian
 European and U.S. workforces
 respectively
 are represented by trade unions or councils. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in those markets. A prolonged labor strike
 work stoppage or other employee-related issue
 could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example
 in the first quarter of 2017
brewery unionized employees commenced a labor strike initiated from on-going negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement.&#160;This labor strike resulted in slower than expected production at the Toronto brewery in the first quarter of 2017. From time to time
 our collective bargaining agreements come due for renegotiation
 and
 if we are unable to timely complete negotiations
 affected employees may strike
Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network
 help desk
 hardware and software configuration. Additionally
 we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology
 including the internet and third-party hosted services
 to support a variety of business processes and activities
 including procurement and supply chain
 manufacturing
 distribution
 invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits
 as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting
 legal and tax requirements. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities
 our business may be impacted by system shutdowns
 service disruptions
 obsolescence
 or security breaches. Additionally
 if one of our service providers were to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner
Our information systems may be the target of cyber-attacks or other security breaches
 which
 if successful
 could
 among other things
 expose us to the loss of key business
 employee
 customer or vendor information
 cause us to breach our legal
 regulatory or contractual obligations
 create an inability to access or rely upon critical business records or cause a disruption of our operations. These breaches may result from human errors
 equipment failure
 or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. If our information systems suffer severe damage
 disruption or shutdown
 we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture
 distribute
We expend significant financial resources to protect against threats and cyber-attacks and may be required to further expend financial resources to alleviate problems caused by physical
 electronic and cyber security breaches. As techniques used to breach security are growing in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target
 regardless of our expenditures and protection efforts
 we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or
 if and when implemented
 these measures could be circumvented. Misuse
 leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations
 such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation
 damage our reputation and credibility or expose us to increased risk of lawsuits
 loss of existing or potential future customers and/or increases in our security costs
 any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition
 we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight or consumers may avoid our brands due to negative publicity. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event of a breach resulting in loss of data
 such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws
 we may be liable for damages
 fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data. Further
 the regulatory framework around data custody
If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to our stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions
 generally the matter will not be approved
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (Pentland) (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors
 Jr. Trust (the Coors Trust) (a trust controlled by the Coors family and related parties)
 which together control more than 90% of our Class&#160;A common stock and Class&#160;A exchangeable shares
 have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class&#160;A common stock and the Class&#160;A exchangeable shares that they own. If these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors)
 the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class&#160;A common stock and Class&#160;A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore
 if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote
 we would be unable to implement the proposal even if our board of directors
 management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly
certain transformational actions. Thus
    Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval
 which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part&#160;II&#8212;Item&#160;8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Changes in the social acceptability of alcohol
The alcoholic beverage industry is regularly the subject of anti-alcohol activist activity related to the health concerns from the misuse of alcohol and concerns regarding underage drinking and exposure to alcohol advertisements. In addition
 in recent years
 there has been an increase in public and political attention on health and well-being as it relates to the alcohol beverage and other industries. Negative publicity regarding beer and changes in consumer perceptions in relation to beer and other alcoholic beverages
 could adversely affect the sale and consumption of our products which could
 in turn
 adversely affect our business and financial conditions. Additionally
 the concerns around alcohol as well as health and well-being could result in unfavorable regulations or other legal requirements in certain of our markets
 such as advertising
 selling and other restrictions
 increased taxes associated with our sales
 or the establishment of minimum unit pricing. Any such regulations or requirements could change consumer and customer purchasing patterns
 which could negatively impact our business
 results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition. In particular
 advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis
 seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us
 to curtail substantially the consumption of alcohol
 including beer
 in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business
 they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example
 in early 2016
 the government of Bihar
 India
 the largest state in India in which our International segment operates
 announced a complete prohibition on the sale and distribution of alcohol
 which resulted in the impairment of assets totaling 
Our internal control over financial reporting may not be designed or operate effectively which could result in material misstatements in our financial statements
 which could
 in turn
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule&#160;13a-15(f). We previously identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2018
 and as a result
 management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2018
(2013).&#8221; We believe this material weakness has been fully addressed by the remediation measures put in place during the 2019 fiscal year. However
Our U.S. business is highly dependent on independent distributors to sell our products
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We sell nearly all of our products
 including all of our imported products
 in the U.S. to independent distributors for resale to retail outlets. These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently
 if we are not allowed
 or are unable under acceptable terms or at all
 to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors
 our business
 financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected

In 2018
 a wholly-owned subsidiary within our Canadian business completed the formation of an independent Canadian joint venture with HEXO
 a Canadian entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange that serves the Canadian cannabis market. The joint venture
 Truss LP
 is developing non-alcoholic
 cannabis-infused beverages for the Canadian market subject to obtaining all of the required licenses and regulatory clearances.&#160;The success and consumer acceptance of any products produced by the joint venture cannot be assured. Further
 our Canadian subsidiary&#8217;s involvement in the Canadian cannabis industry may negatively impact: consumer
 business partner
 investor or public sentiment regarding our brands
 Canadian beer business or our company. The emerging cannabis industry in Canada and in other jurisdictions is evolving rapidly and subjects us to a high degree of political
We may experience adverse effects on our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry
 continued price discounting
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the Canadian beer market continues to decline
 the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally
 continuation or acceleration of price discounting
 in Ontario
 Qu&#233;bec
 Alberta or other provinces
 as well as increases in our cost of goods sold
 could adversely impact our business. Further
 changes in the Canadian tax legislation
 such as the potential for an increase in beer excise taxes
 could decrease our net sales. Although the ultimate impact is currently unknown
 the legalization of cannabis in Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer or our other products. Moreover
 the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 2006
 we sold our previous ownership interest in Kaiser
 which was held by our Canadian business
 to FEMSA Cerveza&#160;S.A. de C.V. (FEMSA). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax
 civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets
 however
 we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies
 of our consolidated net sales in 2019 came from the U.K.
 which is our largest market in Europe. The U.K. exited the European Union on January 31
 2020
 which subjects our Europe segment to regulatory and market uncertainty in the U.K. and in the rest of Europe as the full terms of future trade agreements continue to be negotiated. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union triggered a decline in the GBP in comparison to USD and EUR. Any significant weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Furthermore
 the withdrawal may result in disruption to and decline of the U.K. and European economies. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm the beer business
 and if such conditions emerge in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe
 it may have a material adverse effect on our Europe segment. The withdrawal may also result in significant disruption in trade and the movement of goods
 including prolonged transportation delays
 which could negatively affect our ability to source raw materials and packaging for our products as well as our ability to import and export products. Because the terms of the exit are still unknown and will continue to be negotiated during 2020
 we face regulatory and market uncertainty and may need to quickly adapt to regulatory changes and market volatility
potential higher costs of conducting business in the U.K. or the rest of Europe. Any of these effects
 among others
 could adversely affect our European business
 results of operations
Our European businesses have been
 and
 in the future may be
 adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions
 as well as a weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally
 we face intense competition in certain of our European markets
 particularly with respect to pricing
 which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular
 the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition
 in recent years
 beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise) for the industry in general. Sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers

We have certain operational measures
 such as STWs and STRs
 which we believe are important metrics.&#160;STW is a metric that we use in our business to reflect the sales from our operations to our direct customers
 generally wholesalers.&#160;We believe the STW metric is important because it gives an indication of the amount of beer and adjacent products that we have produced and shipped to customers. STR is a metric that we use in our business to refer to sales closer to the end consumer than STWs
 which generally means sales from our wholesalers or our Company to retailers
 who in turn sell to consumers.&#160;We believe the STR metric is important because

 we craft high-quality
 innovative beverages with the purpose of uniting people to celebrate all life&#8217;s moments. As a business
 our ambition is to be the first choice for our people
 our consumers and our customers
On October 28
 2019
 we initiated a revitalization plan designed to allow us to invest across our portfolio to drive long-term
 sustainable success. As part of this plan
 we expect to accelerate investments behind our largest brands
 by focusing on recruitment of consumers and by driving relevance with breakthrough marketing and innovating on core brands to attract new legal age drinkers. We additionally plan to invest significantly in the above premium segment
 the fastest growing area of the beer industry
 with added investment in existing brands
 new innovations and potentially through new acquisitions. We expect to invest more in whitespace and beyond beer opportunities. We have had success in the above premium segment
 including portfolio transformation in Europe
 growing in Canada. However
 our revitalization plan is designed to give us the resources we need to invest in our core brands and build in the above premium segment through innovation and potential acquisition and investments
 including more investment behind brands like 
 
 wine spritzers
 and 
 in the U.S. Finally
 hard coffee in the U.S.
 premium ciders in the U.K.
 hard seltzer in the U.S.
 which we plan to launch early in 2020
 and Truss&#8217;s expected new line of cannabis-infused non-alcoholic beverages in Canada
 subject to and after all of its licenses and regulatory clearances have been obtained
 including the recently announced 
We also expect to put a greater focus on bringing new beverages to the market faster and with more precision. This includes expanding the model that has reduced the time it takes to bring innovations to market from 18 months to as little as four months in the U.S.
 and expanding our previously mentioned &#8220;test and learn&#8221; approach that evaluates market potential for products and then quickly scales up. As part of the revitalization plan
 we also intend to invest in improving our digital competencies
To make these new investments possible
 we plan to unlock approximately $150 million in annual savings
 increasing our 2020-2022 cost savings program from $450 million to $600 million
We also made the determination to establish Chicago
 Illinois as our North American operational headquarters
 close our existing office in Denver
 Colorado and consolidate certain administrative functions into our other existing office locations. Effective January 2020
 we moved from a corporate center and four business units to two business units - North America and Europe. The North America business unit consolidates the United States
 Canada and corporate center
 enabling us to move more quickly with an integrated portfolio strategy. The Europe business unit allows for standalone operations
 developed and supported by a European-based team
 including a local leadership
 commercial
In connection with these consolidation activities
 certain impacted employees have been extended an opportunity to continue their employment with the Company in the new organization and locations and
 for those not continuing with the Company
 certain of such employees have been asked to provide transition assistance and offered severance and retention packages in connection with their termination of service. After taking into account all changes in each of the business units
 including Europe
 the plan is expected to reduce employment levels
 in aggregate
Further
 we currently expect to incur certain&#160;cash and&#160;non-cash&#160;restructuring charges related to employee relocation
 severance
 retention and transition costs
 non-cash asset related costs
 lease exit costs in connection with our office lease in Denver

 aggressively growing our above premium business - in beer and flavored beverages
 growing beyond beer
We believe our core brands have the power to recruit new legal-age drinkers
 which is why investing in our core brands is a key part of the revitalization plan. In the fourth quarter of 2019
 &#8220;It&#8217;s Miller Time&#8221; campaign in the U.S.

 is a premium light lager that we introduced to consumers with a broad media campaign that kicked off in early February 2020 and showcases how the brand is a better tasting light beer than other competitors. Additionally
 in January 2020
 we agreed to acquire Atwater Brewery
 a regional craft brewer in Michigan. It fills a geographic void
outperforming the broader craft market. We plan to invest more in flavored malt beverages and white spaces that differentiate us and allow us to reach more consumers. Building on our 2019 successes
hard coffee to additional markets. In Canada
 - a popular flavored malt beverage. In March 2020
 we plan to also launch 
 a hard seltzer that offers differentiated ingredients
 in the U.S. which we expect will help it carve out a meaningful space in the hard seltzer category. Lastly
 we intend to expand beyond the beer aisle altogether. In November 2019
 we announced an investment in and partnership with L.A. Libations
 an incubator of better-for-you non-alcoholic beverages. We intend to be selective about where we compete
 always looking to leverage our unique strengths. Additionally
The organizational restructuring is well under way and we are making progress toward our goal of improving efficiency and unlocking an additional $150 million in annual savings
 bringing our total expected costs savings to $600 million over the three year cost savings program discussed below. Effective January 2020
 we have simplified our structure from four business units and a corporate center to two streamlined business units - North America and Europe. In North America our new organizational design is now in place. All teams have been selected and people are transitioning to new office locations. In Europe
 we have announced all senior leadership changes and anticipate the organization will be complete by the end of March 2020. As part of our updated structure
 we have a new data and analytics team and are expanding and developing new commercial and operational capabilities
. We expect the majority of these charges will be cash charges which we began recognizing in the fourth quarter of 2019
Our next generation cost savings program
 which began in 2020 and includes the anticipated benefits of the revitalization plan
 is currently expected to deliver approximately $600 million over the three year program term through 2022 and is focused around many of the same functions of the business as the 2017 to 2019 program. We plan to reinvest these additional cost savings behind our brands and other capability building.

Our defined benefit pension plans cover certain current and former employees in the U.S.
 Canada
 the U.K. and Japan. Benefit accruals for the majority of employees in our U.S. and U.K. plans have been frozen and the plans are closed to new entrants. In the U.S.
 we also participate in
 and make contributions to
 multi-employer pension plans. Our OPEB plans provide medical benefits for retirees and their eligible dependents as well as life insurance and
 in some cases
 dental and vision coverage
 for certain retirees in Canada
 the U.S.
 Corporate
 and Europe. The U.S.
 Canada and U.K. defined benefit pension plans are primarily funded
Accounting for pension and OPEB plans requires that we make assumptions that involve considerable judgment which are significant inputs in the actuarial models that measure our net pension and OPEB obligations and ultimately impact our earnings. These include the discount rate
 long-term expected rate of return on assets
 compensation trends
 inflation considerations
 health care cost trends and other assumptions
 as well as determining the fair value of assets in our funded plans. Specifically
 the discount rates
 as well as the expected rates of return on assets and plan asset fair value determination
 are important assumptions used in determining the plans' funded status and annual net periodic pension and OPEB costs. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. We also
 with the help of actuaries
 periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors
 such as retirement age
 mortality and turnover
 and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate
The assumed discount rates are used to present-value future benefit obligations based on each plan's respective estimated duration. Our pension and postretirement discount rates are based on our annual evaluation of high quality corporate bonds in various markets based on appropriate indices and actuarial guidance. We believe that our discount rate assumptions are appropriate; however

The assumed long-term expected return on assets is used to estimate the actual return that will occur on each individual funded plan's respective plan assets in the upcoming year. We determine each plan's EROA with substantial input from independent investment specialists
 including our actuaries and other consultants. In developing each plan's EROA
 we consider current and expected asset allocations
 historical market rates as well as historical and expected returns on each plan's individual asset classes. In developing future return expectations for each of our plan's assets
 we evaluate general market trends as well as key elements of asset class returns such as expected earnings growth
 yields and spreads. The calculation includes inputs for interest
 inflation
 credit
 and risk premium (active investment management) rates and fees paid to service providers. Based on the above factors and expected asset allocations
 we have assumed
 on a weighted-average basis
. We believe that our EROA assumptions are appropriate; however
To compute the expected return on plan assets
We use the fair value approach to calculate the market-related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic pension cost
We recognize our defined benefit pension plans as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on their underfunded or overfunded status as of our year end and recognize changes in the funded status due to changes in actuarial assumptions in the year in which the changes occur within other comprehensive income. Our funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is measured as the difference between each plan's projected benefit obligation and its assets' fair values. The fair value of plan assets is determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However
 considerable judgment is required in selecting an appropriate methodology and interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value
Equity assets are diversified between domestic and other international investments. Relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. See Part&#160;II&#8212;Item&#160;8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Note 15
December&#160;31
Our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are also influenced by the potential amortization (or non-amortization) from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of deferred gains and losses
and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants. For our closed plans or plans that are primarily inactive
 the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants (including retirees) is used. If our actuarial losses significantly exceed this corridor in the future
 significant incremental pension and postretirement costs could result. As of year-end 
 the deferred losses of several of our Canadian plans
 as well as those in our U.K. plan
 and the deferred gains of our U.S. plan
The assumed health care cost trend rates represent the rates at which health care costs are assumed to increase and are based on actuarial input and consideration of historical and expected experience. We use these trends as a significant assumption in determining our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense of our postretirement health care plan. We believe that our health care cost trend rate assumptions are appropriate; however

 involving significant judgment
 is based on an evaluation of the range of loss related to such matters and where the amount and range can be reasonably estimated. These matters are generally resolved over a number of years and only when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Following our initial determination
 we regularly reassess and revise the potential liability related to any pending matters as new information becomes available. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP
 environmental and legal costs are expensed when incurred. We disclose pending loss contingencies when the loss is deemed reasonably possible

Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment
 or a business unit one level below that operating segment
 for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. As of the date of completion of our 2019 impairment testing
 the operations in each of the specific regions within our U.S.
 Canada
 Europe and International segments are components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. Therefore
 the components within each respective segment must be evaluated for aggregation to determine if the components have similar economic characteristics. As a result
 in certain cases
 we have aggregated components
 within an operating segment
 into one reporting unit if the specific aggregation criteria under U.S. GAAP is met. Specifically
 we have concluded that the components within the U.S.
 Canada and Europe segment each meet the criteria as having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the U.S.
 Canada and Europe reporting units
 respectively. Therefore
 the U.S.
 Canada and Europe reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. However
 for our India business
 the reporting unit is one level below the International operating segment. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units
 including potential changes resulting from our revitalization plan
 could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. As of the date of our annual impairment test
brand families in the U.S.
 distribution rights in Canada
We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that would indicate that impairment may have taken place. We identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill within our Canada and India reporting units at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets was performed as of October 1
Our annual evaluation involves comparing each reporting unit's fair value to its respective carrying value
 including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds carrying value
 then we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value
We use a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units

brand was the result of taking several factors into consideration
 including the excess of the brand's fair value over its carrying value in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis. Our discounted cash flow projections include assumptions for growth rates for sales
 costs and profits
 which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans of each reporting unit or each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Additionally
 discount rates used in our goodwill analysis are based on weighted-average cost of capital
 driven by the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate
 as well as the credit ratings
 financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit
 among other factors. Discount rates for the indefinite-lived intangible analysis by brand largely reflect the rates supporting the overall reporting unit valuation but may differ slightly to adjust for country or market specific risk associated with a particular brand. Our market-based valuations utilize earnings multiples of comparable public companies
 which are reflective of the market in which each respective reporting unit operates
Changes in the factors used in our fair value estimates
 including declines in industry or company-specific beer volume sales
 margin erosion
 termination of brewing and/or distribution agreements with other brewers
 and discount rates used
We identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill within our Canada reporting unit at the end of the third quarter of 2019
. The goodwill impairment trigger was the result of continued challenges and steepening declines within the Canadian beer industry reflected in the prolonged weakened performance of the Canada reporting unit through the third quarter of 2019. These performance headwinds have been countered
 in part
 by the benefit of the recent interest rate environment
 which resulted in a decrease in the risk-free rate included in our current year discount rate calculations. Specifically
 the discount rate used in developing our interim fair value estimate for the Canada reporting unit was 
 used as of the October 1
 2018 annual testing date. However
 the performance declines and increased challenges within the beer industry in Canada
 coupled with significant increases in cost inflation
 volume deleverage
 and resulting margin erosion
 has had a material adverse impact on the expected future cash flows utilized in the valuation approaches for the Canada reporting unit
 such that it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was more likely than not reduced below its carrying amount during the third quarter. As a result of this triggering event
 we performed an interim quantitative analysis
 using a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market-based approaches
 consistent with our annual impairment testing
We also evaluated the indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets within our Canada reporting unit
 prior to recording the goodwill impairment
 and concluded that no impairments were required; however
Separately
 during the third quarter of 2019 we also identified an interim triggering event related to goodwill within our India reporting unit resulting from significant declines in performance in the current year
 coupled with the continuation of challenging business conditions
 which required us to perform an interim quantitative impairment analysis at the end of the third quarter of 2019. As a result of this interim analysis
 we determined that the carrying value of the India reporting unit exceeded its fair value
We completed our required annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of October 1
 2019
 the first day of our fourth quarter
 and concluded there were no additional impairments of goodwill within any of our reporting units. Further
The fair value of the U.S.
 Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 
 in excess of carrying value
 respectively
 as of the October 1
 2019 testing date. In the current year testing
 it was determined that the fair value of the U.S. and Canada reporting units declined during the year
 while there was a slight increase in the fair value of the Europe reporting unit versus the prior year. As a result of our testing
 the Europe and Canada reporting units continue to be considered at risk of impairment. The decline in fair value of the U.S. and Canada reporting units in the current year is largely due to weakening of the overall North American beer market in the current year
 which adversely impacted the results of our impairment testing. These challenges were partially offset by the benefits to our discount rate as a result of the recent interest rate environment. In the U.S. reporting unit
 industry driven declines negatively impacted brand volumes as compared to the prior year; however these headwinds were partially offset by continued investment behind above premium brands and innovation benefiting management's forward-looking plans. In the Europe reporting unit
 while weather and tourism-related headwinds had an adverse impact on current year brand volumes
 forward-looking plans continue to focus on management's premiumization agenda
 which is positively impacting the forecasted future cash flows of the reporting unit. Following the interim goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter within the Canada reporting unit
 the fair value of the Canada reporting unit was reduced to its carrying value. No further deterioration in value was identified in the fourth quarter testing
 and therefore
 the fair value of the Canada reporting unit goodwill equals its carrying value as of the October 1
 2019 testing date. As a result of the interim goodwill impairment charge within the India reporting unit

 including interpretations thereof)
 terminal growth rates
 market multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. For testing purposes of our reporting units
 management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. Current projections used for our Canada reporting unit testing reflect continued challenges within the beer industry in Canada adversely impacting the projected cash flows of the business. Current projections used for our Europe reporting unit incorporate volume and revenue growth driven by management's premiumization agenda
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result
 there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows
 specifically
 a decrease in sales volume and increase in costs that could significantly impact our immediate and long-range results
 a decrease in sales volume driven by a prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends
 a continuation of the trend away from core brands in certain of our markets
 especially in markets where our core brands represent a significant portion of the market
 unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets
 (ii)&#160;adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a recession)
 (iii)&#160;volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital
 (iv) sensitivity to market multiples; and (v) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing
Based on known facts and circumstances
 we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items
 as well as related potential implications
 as part of our annual assessment and incorporate into the analyses as appropriate.&#160;These facts and circumstances are subject to change and may impact future analyses. For example
 we continue to monitor the challenges within the beer industry for further weakening or additional systemic structural declines. Separately
 the Ontario provincial government adopted a bill that
 if enacted
 could adversely impact the existing terms of the beer distribution and retail systems in the province

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business
 there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally
 our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. See Part&#160;II&#8212;Item&#160;8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Note 6
We are periodically subject to tax return audits by both foreign and domestic tax authorities
 which can involve questions regarding our tax positions. Settlement of any challenge resulting from these audits can result in no change
 a complete disallowance
 or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits. We measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our estimated liabilities related to these matters are adjusted in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled
 the statute of limitations for examination expires or when additional information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits requires the use of assumptions and significant judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates made are reasonable
We annually distribute cash from our foreign subsidiaries&#8217; current year earnings and record the tax impacts associated with these transactions.&#160;Any current earnings not otherwise distributed or planned to be distributed in the current year are considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations.&#160;The aggregate of these earnings is currently a deficit for U.S. tax purposes and would not result in any material taxes
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income
 including the reversal of existing temporary differences
 historical and projected operating results
 and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of tax benefits is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount
 an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period a determination was made. Likewise
 should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future

 we actively manage our exposure to various market risks by entering into various supplier-based and market-based hedging transactions
The counterparties to our market-based transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We perform assessments of their credit risk regularly. Our market-based transactions include a variety of derivative financial instruments
We are exposed to volatility in interest rates with regard to current and future debt offerings. Primary exposures include U.S. Department of Treasury rates
 Canadian government rates and LIBOR. To mitigate this exposure as it pertains to future debt offerings and to achieve our desired fixed-to-floating rate debt profile
We use commodities in the production and distribution of our products. To manage the related price risk for these costs
 we utilize market-based derivatives and long-term supplier-based contracts. Our primary objective when entering into these transactions is to achieve price certainty for commodities used in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting

Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging
 subjective
 or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements
 taken as a whole
 and we are not
 by communicating the critical audit matters below
As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company&#8217;s balance related to goodwill in the Europe and Canada reporting units as of December 31
 2019 is $1
484.8 million and $218.1 million
 respectively. The carrying value of goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that would indicate that impairment may have taken place. The Company&#8217;s annual impairment tests are performed as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter; however management identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill within the Canada reporting unit at the end of the third quarter of 2019
 which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of $668.3 million. As disclosed by management
 a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches are used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of management&#8217;s reporting units may include such items as (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows
 specifically
 a decrease in sales volume and increase in costs that could significantly impact management&#8217;s immediate and long-range results
 (ii) prolonged weakening of economic conditions
 or (iii) significant unfavorable changes in tax
 environmental or other regulations
 including interpretations thereof
 terminal growth rates
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments for the Europe and Canada reporting units is a critical audit matter are as follows. There was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurements. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment
 subjectivity and effort in performing our procedures to evaluate the fair value estimates of the goodwill and the significant assumptions
 including the revenue growth rates and terminal growth rate for the Europe reporting unit and the discount rate
 revenue growth rates
 market multiples and terminal growth rate for the Canada reporting unit. In addition
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s goodwill impairment assessments for the Europe and Canada reporting units
 including controls over the valuation. These procedures also included
of goodwill for the Europe and Canada reporting units
 (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches
 (iii) testing the completeness
 accuracy
 and relevance of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches
 and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management including the  revenue growth rates and terminal growth rate for the Europe reporting unit and the discount rate
 revenue growth rates
 market multiples and terminal growth rate for the Canada reporting unit. Evaluating the assumptions related to revenue growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering (i) the Company&#8217;s current and past performance
 (ii) the consistency with third party industry and economic data
 and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Company&#8217;s discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches and the reasonableness of certain significant assumptions
 including the terminal growth rate for the Europe reporting unit and the discount rate
As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company&#8217;s balance related to indefinite-lived intangible assets of distribution networks as of December 31
 2019 is $778.8 million
 brand distribution rights in Canada. The carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is evaluated for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that would indicate that impairment may have taken place. The Company&#8217;s annual impairment test is performed as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. As disclosed by management
 an excess earnings approach is used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of management&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible may include items such as (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows
 specifically
 a decrease in sales volume and increase in costs that could significantly impact management&#8217;s immediate and long-range results
 (ii) prolonged weakening of economic conditions
 or (iii) significant unfavorable changes in tax

On October 28
 2019
 we initiated a revitalization plan designed to allow us to invest across our portfolio to drive long-term
 sustainable success. As part of our revitalization plan
 we made the determination to establish Chicago
 Illinois as our North American operational headquarters
 close our existing office in Denver
 Colorado and consolidate certain administrative functions into our other existing office locations. In connection with these consolidation activities
 effective January 1
 2020
 we changed our management structure to two business units
 our North America and Europe businesses. We began to incur charges related to these restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of 2019; however
Note 3
Note 7
Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S.&#160;GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates
 judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates
 judgments and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable
 based on information available at the time they are made. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results
We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 which we adopted on January&#160;1
 2018 using the modified retrospective transition approach. The adoption of this guidance in 2018 did not have a significant impact to our core revenue generating activities. However
 it did result in the reclassification of certain cash payments to customers from marketing
reduction of revenue. This classification change resulted in a reduction of revenue and marketing
&#160;during&#160;2018 versus 2017
 which is presented under historical U.S. GAAP
 primarily within our Canada segment. The adoption of this guidance also resulted in a change in the timing of recognition of certain promotional discounts and cash payments to customers
 which shifted financial statement recognition primarily amongst quarters
 however
Our net sales represent the sale of beer
 malt beverages and other adjacencies
 net of excise tax. Sales are stated net of incentives
 discounts and returns. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer
 however
 the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled
 which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer
 depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms. Where our products are sold under consignment arrangements
 revenue is not recognized until control has transferred
 which is when the product is sold to the end customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product. The cost of various programs
 such as price promotions
 rebates and coupons are treated as a reduction of sales. In certain of our markets
 we make cash payments to customers such as slotting or listing fees
 or payments for other marketing or promotional activities. These cash payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless we receive a distinct good or service as defined under ASC 606. Specifically
 a good or service is considered distinct when it is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract
 we receive a benefit from the good or service
Certain payments made to customers are conditional on the achievement of volume targets
 marketing commitments
 or both. If paid in advance
 we record such payments as prepayments and amortize them over the relevant period to which the customer commitment is made (generally up to&#160;five&#160;years). When the payment is not for a distinct good or service
 or fair value cannot be reasonably estimated
 the amortization of the prepayment or the cost as incurred is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Where a distinct good or service is received and fair value can be reasonably estimated
 the cost is included as marketing
 general and administrative expenses. The amounts deferred are reassessed regularly for recoverability over the contract period and are impaired where there is objective evidence that the benefits will not be realized or the asset is otherwise not recoverable. Separately
 as discussed below
Our primary revenue generating activity represents the sale of beer and other malt beverages to customers
 including both domestic and exported product sales. Our customer could be a distributor
 retail or on-premise outlet
 depending on the market. The majority of our revenues are generated from brands that we own and brew ourselves
 however
 we also import or brew and sell certain non-owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. In addition
 primarily in the U.K.
 as well as certain other countries in our Europe segment
 we sell other beverage companies' products to on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. We refer to this as the factored brand business. Sales from this business are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold. In the factored brand business
 we normally purchase inventory
 which includes excise taxes charged by the vendor
 take orders from customers for such brands
 negotiate with the customers on pricing and invoice customers for the product and related costs of delivery. In addition
 we incur the risk of loss at times we are in possession of the inventory and for the receivables due from the customers. Revenues for owned brands
 partner and imported brands
We contract manufacture for other brewers in some of our markets. These contractual agreements require us to brew
 package and ship certain brands to these brewers
We also have licensing agreements with third party partners who brew and distribute our products in various markets across our segments. Under these agreements
Note 3
Our revenue generating activities include variable consideration which is recorded as a reduction of the transaction price based upon expected amounts at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. For example
 customer promotional discount programs are entered into with certain distributors for certain periods of time. The amount ultimately reimbursed to distributors is determined based upon agreed-upon promotional discounts which are applied to distributors' sales to retailers. Other common forms of variable consideration include volume rebates for meeting established sales targets
 and coupons and mail-in rebates offered to the end consumer. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recorded. We estimate this variable consideration
 including analyzing for a potential constraint on variable consideration
 by taking into account factors such as the nature of the promotional activity
 historical information and current trends
 availability of actual results
We do not have standard terms that permit return of product; however
December&#160;31
 and December 31
 2018
In certain of our businesses where such practices are legally permitted
 we make loans or advanced payments to retail outlets that sell our brands. For arrangements that do not span greater than one year
December&#160;31
December&#160;31
Advance payments to customers
 where legally permitted
 are deferred and amortized as a reduction to revenue over the expected period of benefit and tested for recoverability as appropriate.&#160;All other costs to obtain and fulfill contracts are expensed as incurred based on the nature

. Separately
 trade accounts receivable
 including affiliate receivables
Freight costs billed to customers for shipping and handling are recorded as revenue. Shipping and handling expense related to costs incurred to deliver product are recognized within cost of goods sold. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control has transferred as a fulfillment cost as opposed to a separate performance obligation
Excise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on beer. Excise taxes are shown in a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of sales. Excise taxes are recognized as a current liability within accounts payable and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets
Our cost of goods sold includes costs we incur to make and ship beer and other malt beverages. These costs include brewing materials
 such as barley
 hops and various grains. Packaging materials
 such as glass bottles
 aluminum cans
 cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Additionally
 our cost of goods sold include both direct and indirect labor
 shipping and handling including freight costs
 utilities
 maintenance costs
 warehousing costs
 purchasing and receiving costs
 depreciation
 promotional packaging
 other manufacturing overheads and costs to purchase factored and other non-owned brands from suppliers
Marketing
Our marketing
 general and administrative expenses include media advertising (television
 radio
 digital
 print)
 tactical advertising (signs
 banners
 point-of-sale materials) and promotion costs on both local and national levels within our operating segments. The creative portion of our advertising activities is expensed as incurred. Production costs of advertising and promotional materials are expensed when the advertising is first run. Marketing
 general and administrative expenses also include integration costs of 
 
 
This classification also includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance
 legal
 human resources and information technology
 along with integration costs as noted above. These costs primarily consist of labor and outside services
 as well as bad debt expense related to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP
 legal costs are expensed when incurred. These costs also include our marketing and sales organizations
 including labor and other overheads. This line item additionally includes amortization costs associated with intangible assets
Share-based compensation is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period of the awards. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. Our share-based compensation plan and the awards within it contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon change in control
 retirement
 disability or death of eligible employees and directors. Our share-based awards are considered vested when the employee's retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing service
 which for certain awards can result in immediate recognition for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or accelerated recognition for awards granted to individuals that will become retirement eligible within the stated vesting period. Also
 if less than the stated vesting period
Our special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that either we do not believe to be indicative of our core operations
 or we believe are significant to our current operating results warranting separate classification; specifically
infrequent or unusual items
impairment or asset abandonment-related losses
restructuring charges and other atypical employee-related costs
The items classified as special items are not necessarily non-recurring
 however
 they are deemed to be incremental to income earned or costs incurred by the company in conducting normal operations
Interest Expense
Our interest costs are associated with borrowings to finance our operations and acquisitions. Interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents across our business is recorded as interest income. Changes in estimates (if any) to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest liabilities
 which are presented within accounts payable and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet
Our other income (expense) classification primarily includes gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to our operations. For instance
 aggregate unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement and settlement of foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities
 as well as certain gains or losses on sales of non-operating assets and the mark-to-market activity associated with warrants are classified in this line item. These gains and losses are reported in the operating segment in which they occur; however
 foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances related to financing and other treasury-related activities are reported within the Corporate segment. The initial recording of foreign-denominated transactions are classified based on the nature of the transaction
 with the unrealized or realized foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the subsequent remeasurement of the monetary asset or liability
 and its ultimate settlement
Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets
 liabilities
 and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We apply the intraperiod tax allocation rules to allocate our provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings
 such as other comprehensive income (loss)
We annually distribute cash from our foreign subsidiaries&#8217; current year earnings and record the tax impacts associated with these transactions.&#160;Any current earnings not otherwise distributed or planned to be distributed in the current year are considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations.&#160;The aggregate of these earnings is currently a deficit for U.S. tax purposes and would not result in any material taxes
 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest
We account for the&#160;tax effects&#160;of global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises
OCI represents income and losses for the reporting period
 including the related tax impacts
 which are excluded from net income (loss) and recognized directly within AOCI as a component of equity. OCI also includes amounts reclassified to income during the reporting period that were previously recognized within AOCI. Amounts remaining within AOCI are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI in the future
 at which point they will be recognized within the consolidated statement of operations as a component of net income (loss). We recognize OCI related to the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than USD
 unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion of our derivatives designated in cash flow and net investment hedging relationships
 actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
 as well as our proportionate share of our equity method investments' OCI. Additionally
 when we do not have the expectation or intent to cash settle certain of our intercompany note receivable and note payable positions in the foreseeable future
Basic EPS was computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the additional dilutive effect of our potentially dilutive securities
 which include RSUs
 DSUs
 PSUs
 and stock options. The dilutive effects of our potentially dilutive securities are calculated using the treasury stock method. Our calculation of weighted-average shares includes Class A common stock and Class B common stock

Cash consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash deposits are maintained with multiple
Non-cash activity includes non-cash issuances of share-based awards
 as well as non-cash investing activities related to movements in our guarantee of indebtedness of certain equity method investments. We also had other non-cash activities primarily related to capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid of

We record accounts and notes receivable at net realizable value. This carrying value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts and notes receivable balances. We calculate this allowance based on our country-specific history of write-offs
 level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with and the economic status of our customers
In the U.K.
 loans are extended to a portion of the retail outlets that sell our brands. We establish an allowance through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings and recorded in marketing
 general&#160;and administrative expenses. Loan balances that are written off are recorded against the allowance as a write-off. Activity within the allowance for credit losses was immaterial for fiscal years 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in
Other current assets include prepaid assets

 months. Maintenance and operating supplies include our inventories of spare parts
 which are kept on hand for repairs and maintenance of machinery and equipment. The majority of spare parts within our business include motors
 fillers and other components that are required to maintain a normal level of production in the event that expected maintenance and/or repairs are required. These parts are inventoried within current assets as they are reasonably expected to be used during the normal operating cycle of the business and are reserved for excess and obsolescence

Properties are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 years. Land is not depreciated
 and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Costs of enhancements or modifications that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated accordingly. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property is sold or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss
 if any
Returnable containers are recorded at acquisition cost and consist of returnable bottles
 kegs
 pallets and crates that are both in our direct control within our breweries
 warehouses and distribution facilities and those that we indirectly control in the market through our agreements with our customers and other brewers and for which a deposit is received. The deposits received on our returnable containers in the market are recorded as deposit liabilities

Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment
 or a business unit one level below that operating segment
 for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. As of the date of completion of our 2019 impairment testing
 the operations in each of the specific regions within our U.S.
 Canada
 Europe and International segments are considered components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. We have concluded that the components within the U.S.
 Canada and Europe segments each meet the criteria as having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the U.S.
 Canada and Europe reporting units
 respectively. Additionally
 we determined that the components within our International segment do not meet the criteria for aggregation with the exception of the operations of our India businesses
 which constitute a separate reporting unit. As the changes in management structure resulting from the revitalization plan discussed above were not effective until January 1

As required
 owned investments where we exercise significant influence or VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We use the cumulative earnings approach for determining cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investees. Distributions received are included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities
 unless the cumulative distributions exceed our portion of the cumulative equity in the net earnings of the equity method investment
Note 4
December&#160;31
We use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
 foreign currency exchange
 commodity prices
 production and packaging material costs and for other strategic purposes related to our core business. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only
 including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize our derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value and are classified in either current or non-current assets or liabilities based on each contract's respective unrealized gain or loss position and each contract's respective maturity. Our policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis
 without regard to counterparty master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Further
 our current derivative agreements do not allow us to net positions with the same counterparty and therefore
Changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow and net investment hedges are recorded in OCI
 until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the underlying hedged item or the sale of the underlying net investment
 respectively. Effective cash flow hedges offset the gains or losses recognized on the underlying exposure in the consolidated statements of operations
 or for net investment hedges
We record realized gains and losses from derivative instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Changes in unrealized gains and losses for derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recorded directly in earnings each period and are also recorded in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Cash flows from the settlement of derivatives
 including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships
In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance
 we do not record the fair value of derivatives for which we have elected the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exemption. We account for these contracts on an accrual basis
We account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 842
 Leases
 which we adopted on January&#160;1
 2019
Note 2
We enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-owned assets
 primarily real estate and equipment
 which are evaluated as finance or operating leases upon commencement
 and are accounted for accordingly. Specifically
 under ASC 842
 a contract is or contains a lease when
 (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) the customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and directs how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. For all contractual arrangements deemed to be leases (other than short-term leases)
 as of the lease commencement date
For leases that qualify as short-term leases
 we have elected
 for all classes of underlying assets
 to not apply the balance sheet recognition requirements of ASC 842
 and instead
 we recognize the lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have also made the election
 for our existing real estate and equipment classes of underlying assets
 years. Certain of our lease agreements contain options to extend or early terminate the agreement. The lease term used to calculate the right-of-use asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impacts of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. When determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement
 we consider various existing economic factors
 including real estate strategies
 the nature
 length
 and terms of the agreement
 as well as the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Based on these determinations
 we generally conclude that the exercise of renewal options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement. Assumptions made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events requiring a lease modification. Additionally
 for certain equipment leases involving groups of similar leased assets with similar lease terms
The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future minimum lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease
 when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable
Certain of our leases include variable lease payments
 primarily for items such as property taxes
 insurance
 maintenance
 and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. These variable payments are excluded from the measurement of our lease assets and liabilities
Lease-related expense is recorded within either cost of goods sold or marketing
 general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations
 depending on the function of the underlying leased asset
 with the exception of interest on finance lease liabilities
We maintain retirement plans for the majority of our employees. We offer different types of plans within each segment
 including defined benefit plans
 defined contribution plans and OPEB plans. Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. Our equity investments
 Brewers' Retail Inc. (BRI) and Brewers' Distributor Ltd. (BDL)
 maintain defined benefit
We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The funded status of a plan
 measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation
We use the fair value approach to calculate the market-related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic pension cost
Projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the measurement date of all benefits attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date using assumptions as to future compensation levels and years of service if the plan benefit formula is based on those future compensation levels and years of service. Accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or unvested) attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensation
 if applicable
We employ the corridor approach for determining each plan's potential amortization from AOCI of deferred gains and losses
 which occur when actual experience differs from estimates
 of the market-related value of plan assets and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants. For plans closed to new entrants and the future accrual of benefits
The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value as recorded due to the short-term nature of these instruments. In addition
 the carrying amounts of our trade loan receivables
 net of allowances
 approximate fair value. The fair value of derivatives is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows utilizing observable market interest
 foreign exchange and commodity rates adjusted for non-performance credit risk associated with our counterparties (assets) or with MCBC (liabilities)
 as appropriate. Additionally

In February 2016
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.

In February 2018
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to improve the usefulness of financial information related to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. This guidance provides an option to reclassify from AOCI to retained earnings the stranded tax effects resulting from the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. We adopted this guidance as of January&#160;1
 2019 and elected to reclassify stranded tax effects related to the 2017 Tax Act
In&#160;June&#160;2016
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial&#160;instruments.&#160;The new guidance&#160;replaces the existing incurred credit loss model
&#160;and requires the application of a&#160;forward-looking expected credit loss model
 which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses&#160;for financial instruments that are in scope of the new guidance
 including trade receivables.&#160;This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December&#160;15

In August 2018
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to address a customer&#8217;s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. This guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The guidance also requires presentation of the capitalized implementation costs in the statement of financial position and in the statement of cash flows in the same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated hosting arrangement would be presented
the hosting element (service) of the arrangement. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December&#160;15
 2019
 including interim periods within those annual periods. We will adopt this guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2020 and are currently evaluating the impact on our financial position
 results of operations and statement of cash flows. The adoption of this guidance will result in the change in presentation of capitalized implementation costs related to hosting arrangements from properties to other assets on the consolidated balance sheet
In December 2019
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. This guidance eliminates certain exceptions to the general approach to the income tax accounting model
 and adds new guidance to reduce the complexity in accounting for income taxes. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December&#160;15

Authoritative guidance related to the consolidation of VIEs requires that we continually reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of VIEs in which we have an interest. As such

 net of other revenues earned
 and is allocated in accordance with the operating agreement to its owners based on volume of products. Contractual provisions cause participation in governance and other interests to fluctuate based on this calculated market share requiring frequent primary beneficiary evaluations. However
 based on the existing structure
 control is shared
 and remains shared through such changes
 and therefore we do not anticipate becoming the primary beneficiary in the foreseeable future. We consider BRI an affiliate. See Affiliate Transactions section below summarizing our transactions and balances with affiliates

 we mutually agreed with Asahi that the agreements would terminate with immediate effect and that we would receive a payment in November 2019. As a result
 the Grolsch joint venture ceased all operations
 including the production
 marketing and sale of the Grolsch brands in these markets

 we reassessed our status as the primary beneficiary of the joint venture and concluded that we were no longer able to exert control over the operations or direction of the joint venture or otherwise influence the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the entity. Therefore
 we deconsolidated the joint venture and recorded an immaterial loss on deconsolidation as a special item during the third quarter of 2019. The aggregate loss related to the termination of the Grolsch business

Our deferred tax valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if
 based upon available evidence
 it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income

The Class&#160;A exchangeable shares and Class&#160;B exchangeable shares were issued by Molson Coors Canada&#160;Inc. (MCCI)
 a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The exchangeable shares are substantially the economic equivalent of the corresponding shares of Class&#160;A and Class&#160;B common stock that a Molson shareholder would have received in the merger of Adolph Coors Company with Molson Inc. in February 2005
common stock. Exchangeable shareholders receive the CAD equivalent of dividends declared on Class A and B common stock on the date of declaration. Holders of exchangeable shares also receive
 through a voting trust
 the benefit of Molson Coors voting rights
Each holder of record of Class A common stock
 Class B common stock
 Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares is entitled to one vote for each share held
 without the ability to cumulate votes on the election of directors. Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over company actions requiring stockholder approval. Specifically
 holders of Class B common stock voting together as a single class have the right to elect three directors of the Molson Coors Board of Directors
 as well as the right to vote on certain additional matters as outlined in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended
 the &#8220;Certificate&#8221;)
 such as merger agreements that require approval under applicable law
 sales of all or substantially all of the our assets to unaffiliated third parties

 and certain amendments to the Certificate that require approval under applicable law
 each as further described and limited by the Certificate. The Certificate also provides that holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock shall vote together as a single class
 on an advisory basis
The Certificate provides for the right of holders of Class&#160;A common stock to convert their stock into Class&#160;B common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time. The exchangeable shares are exchangeable at any time

We identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill within our Canada reporting unit at the end of the third quarter of 2019
. The goodwill impairment trigger was the result of continued challenges and steepening declines within the Canadian beer industry reflected in the prolonged weakened performance of the Canada reporting unit through the third quarter of 2019. These performance headwinds have been countered
 in part
 by the benefit of the recent interest rate environment
 which resulted in a decrease in the risk-free rate included in our current year discount rate calculations. Specifically
 the discount rate used in developing our interim fair value estimate for the Canada reporting unit was 
 used as of the October 1
 2018 annual testing date. However
 the performance declines and increased challenges within the beer industry in Canada
 coupled with significant increases in cost inflation
 volume deleverage
 and resulting margin erosion
 has had a material adverse impact on the expected future cash flows utilized in the valuation approaches for the Canada reporting unit
 such that it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was more likely than not reduced below its carrying amount during the third quarter of 2019. As a result of this triggering event
 we performed an interim quantitative analysis
 using a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market-based approaches
 consistent with our annual impairment testing
We also evaluated the indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets within our Canada reporting unit
 prior to recording the goodwill impairment
 and concluded that no impairments were required; however
Separately
 during the third quarter of 2019 we also identified an interim triggering event related to goodwill within our India reporting unit resulting from significant declines in performance in the current year
 coupled with the continuation of challenging business conditions
 which required us to perform an interim quantitative impairment analysis at the end of the third quarter of 2019. As a result of this interim analysis
 we determined that the carrying value of the India reporting unit exceeded its fair value
We completed our required annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of October 1
 2019
 the first day of our fourth quarter
 and concluded there were no additional impairments of goodwill within any of our reporting units. Further
As of the date of our impairment test
 the operations in each of the specific regions within our U.S.
 Canada
 Europe and International segments are considered components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. We have concluded that the components within the U.S.
 Canada and Europe segments each meet the criteria of having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the U.S.
 Canada and Europe reporting units
 respectively. Additionally
 we determined that the components within our International segment do not meet the criteria for aggregation
 and therefore

 potential changes to our reporting units
 if any
Note 1
The fair value of the U.S.
 Europe and Canada reporting units were estimated at approximately 
excess of carrying value
 respectively
 as of the October 1
 2019 testing date. In the current year testing
 it was determined that the fair value of the U.S. and Canada reporting units declined during the year
 while there was a slight increase in the fair value of the Europe reporting unit versus the prior year. As a result of our testing
 the Europe and Canada reporting units continue to be considered at risk of impairment. The decline in fair value of the U.S. and Canada reporting units in the current year is largely due to weakening of the overall North American beer market in 2019
 which adversely impacted the results of our impairment testing. These challenges were partially offset by the benefits to our discount rate as a result of the recent interest rate environment. Specifically
 the discount rate used in developing our annual fair value estimates for the U.S.
 for all reporting units
 based on market-specific factors
 as compared to 
 
 respectively used as of the October 1
 2018 annual testing date. In the U.S. reporting unit
 industry driven declines negatively impacted brand volumes as compared to 2018; however these headwinds were partially offset by continued investment behind above premium brands and innovation benefiting management's forward-looking plans. In the Europe reporting unit
 while weather and tourism-related headwinds had an adverse impact on current year brand volumes
 forward-looking plans continue to focus on management's premiumization agenda
 which is positively impacting the forecasted future cash flows of the reporting unit. Following the interim goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2019 within the Canada reporting unit
 the fair value of the Canada reporting unit was reduced to its carrying value. No further deterioration in value was identified in the fourth quarter testing
 and therefore
 the fair value of the Canada reporting unit goodwill equals its carrying value as of the October 1
 2019 testing date. As a result of the interim goodwill impairment charge within the India reporting unit
Although the fair value of each of our reporting units was determined to be either equal to or in excess of its respective carrying value as of the October 1
 2019
 testing date
 the fair value determinations are sensitive to further unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows
 macroeconomic conditions
The fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Europe
 brands
We utilized Level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of certain indefinite-lived intangible brand assets
 brands in the U.S.
 brand distribution rights in Canada
 which utilizes an excess earnings approach to determine the fair values of these assets as of the testing date. The future cash flows used in the analysis are based on internal cash flow projections based on our long range plans and include significant assumptions by management as noted below. Separately
 we performed qualitative assessments of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets
 brand in Europe and water rights in the U.S.
 to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair values of these assets were greater than their respective carrying amounts. Based on the qualitative assessments
As of the date of our annual impairment test
 performed as of October 1
 the Europe and Canada reporting unit goodwill balances are at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged weakening of economic conditions
 or significant unfavorable changes in tax
 environmental or other regulations
 including interpretations thereof)
 terminal growth rates
 market multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. For testing purposes of our reporting units
continued challenges within the beer industry in Canada adversely impacting the projected cash flows of the business. Current projections used for our Europe reporting unit incorporate volume and revenue growth driven by management's premiumization agenda
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result
 there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows
 specifically
 a decrease in sales volume and increase in costs that could significantly impact our immediate and long-range results
 a decrease in sales volume driven by a prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends
 a continuation of the trend away from core brands in certain of our markets
 especially in markets where our core brands represent a significant portion of the market
 unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets
 (ii)&#160;adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a recession)
 (iii)&#160;volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital
 (iv) sensitivity to market multiples; and (v) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing
Based on known facts and circumstances
 we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items
 as well as related potential implications
 as part of our annual assessment and incorporate into the analyses as appropriate.&#160;These facts and circumstances are subject to change and may impact future analyses. For example
 we continue to monitor the challenges within the beer industry for further weakening or additional systemic structural declines. Separately
 the Ontario provincial government adopted a bill that
 if enacted
 could adversely impact the existing terms of the beer distribution and retail systems in the province

While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets equal to or in excess of carrying values

We maintain retirement plans for the majority of our employees. Depending on the location and benefit program
 we provide either defined benefit pension or defined contribution pension plans to our employees. Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. We have defined benefit pension plans in the U.S.
 U.K.
 Canada and Japan. All active retirement plans for Corporate employees are defined contribution plans. Additionally

The obligations of our defined benefit pension plans in the U.S.
 Canada and the U.K. are supported by assets held in trusts for the payment of future benefits. The business segments are obligated to adequately fund these asset trusts. The underlying investments within our defined benefit pension plans include: cash and short-term instruments
 debt securities
 equity securities
 investment funds
 and other investments including derivatives
Each plan's respective allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given a focus on a long-term time horizon for fulfilling the plans' obligations. All assets are managed by external investment managers with a mandate to either match or outperform their benchmark. The plans used different asset managers in the U.S.
Our investment strategies for our defined benefit pension plans also consider the funding status for each plan. For defined benefit pension plans that are highly funded
 assets are invested primarily in fixed income holdings that have a similar duration to the associated liabilities. For plans with lower funding levels
 the fixed income component is managed in a similar manner to the highly funded plans. In addition to this liability-matching fixed income allocation
 these plans also contain exposure to return generating assets including: equities
 real estate
 debt
 and other investments held with the goal of producing higher returns
Both our U.K. and Canadian plans hedge a portion of the foreign exchange exposure between plan assets that are not denominated in the local plan currency and the local currency as the Canadian and U.K. pension liabilities will be settled in CAD and GBP

 we did not have any individual underlying asset position that composed a significant concentration of each plan's overall assets. However
 we currently have significant plan assets invested in U.K.
Further
 as our benefit plans maintain exposure to non-government investments
 a significant system-wide increase in credit spreads would also negatively impact the reported plan asset values. In general
 equity and fixed income risks have been mitigated by company-specific concentration limits and by utilizing multiple equity managers. We do have significant amounts of assets invested with individual fixed income and hedge fund managers
 therefore
We use a variety of industry accepted valuation techniques to value our plan assets. The techniques vary depending upon instrument type. Whenever possible
 we prioritize the use of observable market data in our valuation processes. We use market

These payables normally settle within a few business days of the purchase or sale of the respective asset. The respective assets are included in or removed from our year end plan assets and categorized in their respective asset categories in the fair value hierarchy below.

 as the values are derived from quoted prices in active markets. Short-term instruments are included in Level&#160;2 of the fair value hierarchy as these are highly liquid instruments that are valued using observable inputs
Debt securities&#8212;Includes various government and corporate fixed income securities
 interest and inflation-linked assets such as bonds and swaps
 collateralized securities
 and other debt securities. The majority of the plans' fixed income assets trade on over the counter exchanges
 which provides observable inputs that are the primary data used to determine each individual investment's fair value. We also use independent pricing vendors
 as well as matrix pricing techniques. Matrix pricing uses observable data from other similar investments as the primary input to determine the individual security's fair value. Government and corporate fixed income securities are generally classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using observable inputs. Assets included in our collateralized securities include mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations
Equities&#8212;Includes publicly traded common and other equity-like holdings
NAV per share practical expedient&#8212;Includes our debt funds
 equity funds
 hedge fund of funds
 infrastructure funds
Other&#8212;Includes derivatives
 repurchase agreements
 recoverable taxes for taxes paid and awaiting reclaim due to the tax exempt nature of the pension plan
 venture capital
 and private equity. Derivatives are priced using observable inputs including yields
 interest rate curves and spreads. Exchange traded derivatives are typically priced using the last trade price. Repurchase agreements are agreements where our plan has created an asset exposure using borrowed assets
 creating a repurchase agreement liability
 to facilitate the trade. The assets associated with the repurchase agreement and equity options are included in the other category in the fair value hierarchy
 and the corresponding repurchase agreement liability is classified as Level&#160;1 in the hierarchy
 as the liability is valued using quoted prices in active markets. When determining the presentation of our target and asset allocations for repurchase agreements
 we are viewing the asset type
 as opposed to the investment vehicle
 and accordingly include the associated assets within fixed income
 specifically interest and inflation linked assets. We include recoverable tax items in Level&#160;1 of this hierarchy

We use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
 foreign currency
To achieve our objectives
 we enter into a variety of financial derivatives
 including foreign currency exchange
 commodity
 interest rate
While
 by policy
 the counterparties to any of the financial derivatives we enter into are major institutions with investment grade credit ratings of at least A- by Standard&#160;&amp; Poor's (or the equivalent) or A3 by Moody's
 we are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties. This credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts
We have established a counterparty credit policy and guidelines that are monitored and reported to management according to prescribed guidelines to assist in managing this risk. As an additional measure
 we utilize a portfolio of institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries that we conduct our business. In calculating the fair value of our derivative balances
 we also record an adjustment to recognize the risk of counterparty credit and our own non-performance risk
We base the fair value of our derivative instruments upon market rates and prices. The volatility of these rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. The current fair values of our contracts could differ significantly from the cash settled values with our counterparties. As such
We may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date upon the occurrence of certain contractual triggers including a change of control
 termination event or other breach of agreement. This could have a negative impact on our liquidity. For derivative contracts that we have designated as hedging instruments
 early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the forecasted transaction or firm commitment. We may also decide to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date through negotiations with our counterparties
Due to the nature of our counterparty agreements
 we are not able to net positions with the same counterparty across business units. Thus
 in the event of default
 we may be required to early settle all out-of-the-money contracts
We do not receive and are not required to post collateral unless a change of control event occurs. This termination event would give either party the right to early terminate all outstanding swap transactions in the event that the other party consolidates
 merges with
 or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
 another entity
December&#160;31

Our foreign currency forwards and our forward starting interest rate swaps are designated in hedging relationships as cash flow hedges
 and our cross currency swaps are designated as net investment hedges. Prior to settlements discussed below
interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges. In certain situations
 we may execute derivatives that do not qualify for
 or we do not otherwise seek
 hedge accounting but are determined to be important for managing risk. For example
 our commodity swaps and commodity options are not designated in hedge accounting relationships. These outstanding economic hedges are measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. We have historically elected to apply the NPNS exemption to certain contracts
We formally document all relationships receiving hedge accounting treatment between hedging instruments and hedged items
 as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions pursuant to prescribed guidance. We also formally assess effectiveness both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis
 specifically whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in mitigating the risk designated as being hedged and whether those hedges may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Specific to net investment hedges
We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1)&#160;the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a forecasted future transaction; (2)&#160;the derivative expires or is sold
 terminated
When we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively
 but it continues to be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period
 the existing gain or loss on the derivative remains in AOCI for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or in the carrying value of the hedged item for fair value hedges and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However
 if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter
 the gains and losses in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding
 we carry the derivative at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheets until maturity
During the fourth quarter of 2017
 we voluntarily settled our interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of

Forward starting interest rate swaps are instruments we use to manage our exposure to the volatility of the interest rates associated with future interest payments on a forecasted debt issuance. During the third quarter of 2018

 for July 2021
 May 2022 and July 2026
 respectively. Under the agreements we are required to early terminate these swaps at the time we expect to issue the related forecasted debt. We have designated these contracts as cash flow hedges. As a result
 in order to manage our exposure to the volatility of the interest rates associated with the future interest payments on the forecasted CAD debt issuances

 representing a majority of the anticipated net proceeds from the issuance of the respective 2017 EUR Notes
 to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of the associated notes against the USD prior to issuance and to convert the proceeds to USD upon issuance through gross settlement. We settled these foreign currency forwards on March&#160;15
 2017
. These foreign currency forwards were not designated in hedge accounting relationships
 and
 accordingly
We have financial foreign exchange forward contracts in place to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We hedge foreign currency exposure related to certain royalty agreements
 exposure associated with the purchase of production inputs and imports that are denominated in currencies other than the functional entity's local currency
We have financial commodity swap and option contracts in place to hedge changes in the prices of natural gas
 aluminum
 including surcharges relating to our aluminum exposures
 corn
 barley and diesel. These contracts allow us to swap our floating exposure to changes in these commodity prices for a fixed rate. These contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships. As such
 changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. We hedge forecasted purchases of natural gas
 aluminum
 out in the future for use in our supply chain
 in line with our risk management policy. Further
 we hedge forecasted purchases of barley based on crop year and physical inventory management. For purposes of measuring segment operating performance
 the unrealized changes in fair value of the swaps not designated in hedge accounting relationships are reported in Corporate outside of the segment specific operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing is realized. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from Corporate to the operating segment

The sum of the quarterly net income per share amounts may not agree to the full-year net income per share amounts. We calculate net income per share based on the weighted-average number of outstanding shares during the reporting period. The average number of shares fluctuates throughout the year and can therefore produce a full-year result that does not agree to the sum of the individual quarters. Additionally
 due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss attributable to MCBC for the three months ended September&#160;30
 2019
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule&#160;13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation
December&#160;31
 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such disclosure controls and procedures that
 by their nature
 can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. Also
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule&#160;13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&#160;pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&#160;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)&#160;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

 claims or obsolete inventories and supplies.

This notice must include a description of the conversion procedures including the election procedures described below
Subject to conditions described below
 if an &#8220;exclusionary offer&#8221; is made for shares of our Class&#160;A Common Stock
An &#8220;exclusionary offer&#8221; is an offer to purchase shares of our Class&#160;A Common Stock that both: (A)&#160;either (1)&#160;must
 by reason of applicable securities laws or the requirements of a stock exchange on which shares of our Class&#160;A Common Stock are listed
 be open to all or substantially all holders of our Class&#160;A Common Stock
 or (2)&#160;would
 if the offer were made in Canada or a province of Canada
 be required to be made to all or substantially all holders of shares of our Class&#160;A Common Stock resident in Canada or a province of Canada by reason of applicable securities laws of Canada or a province of Canada
 the requirements of a stock exchange on which shares of our Class&#160;A Common Stock are listed
 or the requirements of the Canada Business Corporations Act; and (B)&#160;is not made concurrently with an offer to purchase shares of our Class&#160;B Common Stock that is identical to the offer to purchase shares of our Class&#160;A Common Stock in terms of price per share and percentage of outstanding shares to be purchased (exclusive of shares owned immediately prior to the offer by the offeror) and in all other respects (except with respect to the conditions that may be attached to the offer to purchase shares of our Class&#160;A Common Stock)
The Class&#160;B conversion right will not come into effect if one or more holders owning
 in the aggregate
 as of the offer date
 over 50% of the outstanding shares of our Class&#160;A Common Stock and Class&#160;A Exchangeable Shares
 in each case excluding shares owned by the offeror
The Class&#160;A Exchangeable Shares and Class&#160;B Exchangeable Shares (collectively
 &#8220;Exchangeable Shares&#8221;) were issued by Molson Coors Canada Inc. (&#8220;MCCI&#8221;)
 a wholly-owned
 indirect subsidiary of Molson Coors. The Exchangeable Shares are substantially the economic equivalent of the corresponding shares of Company Common Stock in which they may be exchanged.&#160; As of February 5
 2020
 there were outstanding 2
725
130 Class&#160;A Exchangeable Shares and 14
826
&#160;&#160; Holders of Exchangeable Shares are entitled to receive
 subject to applicable law
in the case of a cash dividend declared on a corresponding share of Company Common Stock
in the case of a stock dividend declared on a corresponding share of Company Common Stock to be paid in shares of Company Common Stock
in the case of a dividend declared on a corresponding share of Company Common Stock in any other type of property
The declaration dates
&#160;&#160; Holders of Exchangeable Shares receive
 through a voting trust
 the benefit of voting rights
&#160;&#160; The Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable at any time
We have outstanding one share of Special Class&#160;A Voting Stock and one share of Special Class&#160;B Voting Stock
 through which the holders of Class&#160;A Exchangeable Shares and Class&#160;B Exchangeable Shares
 respectively
&#160;&#160; The trustee who holds the Special Class&#160;A Voting Stock and the trustee who holds the Special Class&#160;B Voting Stock are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions or to receive or participate in any distribution of assets upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation
&#160;&#160; The Special Class&#160;A Voting Stock and the Special Class&#160;B Voting Stock provide the mechanism for holders of the corresponding Exchangeable Shares to provide instructions to vote with the holders of our corresponding Company Common Stock.&#160; The Special Class&#160;A Voting Stock and Special Class&#160;B Voting Stock are subject to voting trust arrangements.&#160; The trustee who holds the Special Class&#160;A Voting Stock and the trustee who holds the Special Class&#160;B Voting Stock are each entitled to one vote for each corresponding outstanding Exchangeable Share
 excluding shares held by Molson Coors or its subsidiaries
The trustee who holds the Special Class&#160;A Voting Stock and the trustee which holds the Special Class&#160;B Voting Stock are required to cast a number of votes equal to the number of then-outstanding corresponding Exchangeable Shares
 but will only cast a number of votes equal to the number of corresponding Exchangeable Shares as to which it has received voting instructions from the owners of record of those Exchangeable Shares
 other than Molson Coors or its subsidiaries
 on the record date of the action
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 25
000
from time to time in one or more series
 generally without any vote or action by the holders of our Company Common Stock
 except that the issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock having any voting rights other than those expressly required by the DGCL will be subject to approval by a majority of the voting power of the holders of our Class&#160;A Common Stock and Special Class&#160;A Voting Stock
 voting together as a single class.&#160; Subject to this right
 our Board of Directors will be authorized to determine the number of shares and designation of any series of Preferred Stock and the dividend rate
 dividend rights
 liquidation preferences
 conversion rights and terms
 voting rights
 redemption rights and terms and sinking fund terms of any series of Preferred Stock. Depending on the terms of any issued Preferred Stock
 any or all series of issued Preferred Stock could have a preference over our Company Common Stock with respect to dividends and other distributions and upon liquidation or dissolution of Molson Coors. Subject to certain conditions as specified in our certificate of incorporation
 our Board of Directors
 without stockholder approval
 can issue Preferred Stock with voting
Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation
Provisions of our certificate of incorporation
 our bylaws and Delaware law could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us
 even if the acquisition would benefit our stockholders. These provisions may delay
 defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt of our company that a stockholder might consider in the stockholder&#8217;s best interest
 including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.&#160; These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our Board of Directors and in the policies formulated by our Board of Directors and to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited proposal for a takeover that does not contemplate the acquisition of all of our outstanding shares
Subject to certain conditions
 our authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock and Preferred Stock are available for our Board of Directors to issue without stockholder approval.&#160; As noted above
 our Board of Directors
 without stockholder approval
 has the authority under our certificate of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock
 subject to certain conditions.&#160; As a result
 preferred stock could be issued quickly
 could adversely affect the rights of holders of Company Common Stock and could be issued with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change of control or make removal of management more difficult.&#160; We may use the additional authorized shares of Company Common Stock or Preferred Stock for a variety of corporate purposes
 including future public offerings to raise additional capital
 corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans.&#160; The existence of our authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock and Preferred Stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a proxy contest
 tender offer
Election
Our Board of Directors has currently set the size of the board at 15 members.&#160; Twelve of the 15 directors may be elected by the Class&#160;A Holders
election to our Board of Directors by the Class&#160;A Holders
 and the Class&#160;A-M Nominating Subcommittee (consisting of two Molson family directors) similarly may nominate five nominees to stand for election to our Board of Directors by the Class&#160;A Holders.&#160; The Nominating Committee (comprised of an independent director
 the members of the Class&#160;A-C Nominating Subcommittee and the members of the Class&#160;A-M Nominating Subcommittee) may nominate two additional directors to stand for election to our Board of Directors by the Class&#160;A Holders.&#160; The full Board of Directors may nominate three directors to stand for election to our Board of Directors by the Class&#160;B Holders.&#160; Any director may be removed
 with cause
 by a majority vote of the Class&#160;A Holders and the Class&#160;B Holders
 voting together as a single class.&#160; Any director may be removed
 without cause
 by a vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the class or classes that elected the director.&#160; Further
 only our Board of Directors may change the size of our board
 subject to certain conditions.&#160; Because this system of electing
 appointing and removing directors generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of our Board of Directors
 it may discourage a third party from initiating a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control of our company

The notes were issued under the indenture in an aggregate principal amount of &#8364;800 million. The notes will mature on July 15
 2024. The notes were issued only in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of &#8364;100
000 and integral multiples of &#8364;1
000 above that amount. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of the notes
Interest accrues on the notes at the rate of 1.25% per annum from July 7
 2016
 or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for
 and is payable in cash annually in arrears on July 15 of each year to the persons in whose names the notes are registered in the security register at the close of business on the July 5 preceding the relevant interest payment date
 except that interest payable at maturity shall be paid to the same persons to whom principal of such notes is payable. Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the notes (or July 7
 2016 if no interest has been paid on the notes)
 to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Markets Association. Principal and interest are payable
 and the notes are transferable or exchangeable
If any interest payment date is not a Business Day
 we will pay interest on the next day that is a Business Day as if payment were made on the date such payment was due
 and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for such delay. A &#8220;Business Day&#8221; is a day other than a Saturday

 we may
 without the consent of the holders of the notes
 issue additional notes having the same terms and conditions in all respects as the notes
date and the issue price. Any such additional notes having such similar terms
 together with the notes
 will be treated as a single series of securities under the indenture

 such additional notes will have separate ISIN

 and (ii) a Guarantor shall not merge or sell

 under the indenture (it being understood that any obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall be determined mutatis mutandis
 by treating any jurisdiction under the laws of which such successor is organized or resident for tax purposes and any political subdivision or taxing authority as therein having the power to tax
Jurisdiction)
 and (iii) after giving effect to such transaction
The indenture provides that the Company may elect either (i) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the notes (except as otherwise provided in the indenture) (&#8220;defeasance&#8221;) or (ii) to be released
 and to have the Guarantors released
 from any and all obligations with respect to certain covenants that are described in the indenture (&#8220;covenant defeasance&#8221;)
 upon the irrevocable deposit with the paying agent
 in trust for such purpose
 of money and/or government obligations that through the payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient
 without reinvestment
 to pay the principal of
 premium
 if any
 and interest on the notes to maturity or redemption
 as the case may be (provided that any excess moneys or government obligations and any moneys or government obligations remaining unclaimed after two years from the maturity date or redemption date
 as applicable
 with respect to such notes will be repaid). As a condition to defeasance or covenant defeasance
 the Company must deliver to the trustee (with a copy to the paying agent) an opinion of counsel to the effect that the beneficial owners of the notes will not recognize income
 gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance or covenant defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts

 if acceleration were to occur for other reasons
 the realizable value at the acceleration date of the money and government obligations in the defeasance trust could be less than the principal and interest then due on the notes
 in that the required deposit in the defeasance trust is based upon scheduled cash flows rather than market value
As used in this section
default in the payment of principal (or premium
if payment of any Debt of the Company
 the Guarantors or any of the Company&#8217;s Significant Subsidiaries in a principal amount exceeding $200 million is accelerated as a result of the failure of the Company
certain events of bankruptcy
If an event of default described in clause (1) through (4) above shall occur and be continuing with respect to the outstanding notes
 then either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the notes may declare the principal and premium
 if any
 of the notes and the accrued interest thereon
 if any
 to be due and payable. If an event of default described in clause (5) above shall occur and be continuing
 then the principal and premium
 if any
 of the notes and the accrued interest thereon
 if any
 shall be due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders of the notes. The indenture provides that the trustee shall
 within 90 days after the occurrence of a default known to the trustee
 give the holders of the notes notice of all uncured defaults known to it (the term &#8220;default&#8221; to mean the events specified above without grace periods); provided that
 except in the case of default in the payment of principal of or interest on the notes
 the trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if it in good faith determines the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the holders of the notes and so advises the Company in writing. At any time after such declaration of acceleration has been made
 the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes
 by written notice to the Company and the trustee
 may
 in certain circumstances
 rescind and annul such declaration with respect to the notes
 provided that such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree
 and if all existing events of default have been cured or waived except non-payment of the principal amount or premium
 if any
We are required to furnish to the trustee (with a copy to the paying agent) within 120 days after the end of the Company&#8217;s fiscal year (and at least once in each 12 month period and at any other reasonable time upon demand of the trustee) a statement by certain officers to the effect that
 to the best of their knowledge
 no default has occurred under the indenture or
 if there has been a default
 specifying each such default. The holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the notes affected will have the right
 subject to certain limitations
 to direct the time
 method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the notes
 and to waive certain defaults with respect thereto. The indenture provides that in case an event of default shall occur and be continuing
 the trustee shall exercise such of its rights and powers under the indenture
 and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise
 as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions
 the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request of any of the holders of the notes unless they first shall have offered to the trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs
Before any holder of notes may institute action for any remedy
 except payment on such holder&#8217;s notes when due

conform the indenture and/or the notes to the section entitled &#8220;Description of the Notes&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s prospectus supplement related to the initial offering of the notes
 dated June 29
The indenture also contains provisions permitting the Company
 the Guarantors and the trustee
 with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of notes affected to add any provisions to
 or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of
 the indenture or modify in any manner the rights of the holders of such series of notes so affected. However
 the Company may not
reduce the principal amount (or premium
The holders of at least a majority in principal amount of each series affected thereby then outstanding
 may waive compliance by the Company and the Guarantors with certain restrictive provisions of the indenture applicable to such series. The holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of each series affected thereby then outstanding may waive any past default under the indenture applicable to such series
 except a default (a) in the payment of principal of (and premium
 if any) or any interest on such series
 (b) in respect of a covenant
 or provision of the indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each note of such series outstanding affected

Except during the continuance of an event of default
 the trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in the indenture and no others
 and no implied covenants or obligations will be read into the indenture against the trustee. In case an event of default has occurred and is continuing
 the trustee shall exercise those rights and powers vested in it by the indenture
 and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise
 as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. No provision of the indenture requires the trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties thereunder
 or in the exercise of its rights or powers
 unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss
Holders are required to pay for the notes in euro
 and all payments of interest and principal
 including payments made upon any redemption of the notes
 will be payable in euro. If the euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community
 then all payments in respect of the notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances
The indenture provides that the Company will agree
 to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law
 that (a) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court with respect to the notes it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal
 premium
 if any
 or interest
 if any
 payable with respect to such notes into a currency in which a judgment can be rendered (the &#8220;Judgment Currency&#8221;)

 Required Currency per Judgment Currency) received by the Company from three recognized foreign exchange dealers in the City of New York for the purchase of the aggregate amount of the judgment (as denominated in the Judgment Currency) on the Business Day preceding the date on which a final unappealable judgment is rendered
 for settlement on such payment date
 and at which the applicable dealer timely commits to execute a contract
 and (b) the Company&#8217;s obligations under the indenture to make payments in the Required Currency (i) will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender
 or by any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with the preceding clause (a))
 in any currency other than the Required Currency
 except to the extent that such tender or recovery will result in the actual receipt by the judgment creditor of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments
 (ii) will be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount
 if any
 by which such actual receipt will fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable
Book-Entry
The notes were issued in the form of one or more fully registered global notes (each a &#8220;global note&#8221;) which were deposited with

All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Use of Estimates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S.&#160;GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Revenue Recognition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#x201c;ASC&#x201d;) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we adopted on January&#160;1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition approach. The adoption of this guidance in 2018 did not have a significant impact to our core revenue generating activities. However, it did result in the reclassification of certain cash payments to customers from marketing, general and administrative expenses to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;reduction of revenue. This classification change resulted in a reduction of revenue and marketing, general and administrative expenses by approximately&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$60 million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&#160;during&#160;2018 versus 2017, which is presented under historical U.S. GAAP, primarily within our Canada segment. The adoption of this guidance also resulted in a change in the timing of recognition of certain promotional discounts and cash payments to customers, which shifted financial statement recognition primarily amongst quarters, however, the full-year impact was not significant to our financial results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our net sales represent the sale of beer, malt beverages and other adjacencies, net of excise tax. Sales are stated net of incentives, discounts and returns. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer, however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms. Where our products are sold under consignment arrangements, revenue is not recognized until control has transferred, which is when the product is sold to the end customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product. The cost of various programs, such as price promotions, rebates and coupons are treated as a reduction of sales. In certain of our markets, we make cash payments to customers such as slotting or listing fees, or payments for other marketing or promotional activities. These cash payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless we receive a distinct good or service as defined under ASC 606. Specifically, a good or service is considered distinct when it is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract, we receive a benefit from the good or service, and the benefit is separable from the sale of our product to the customer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Certain payments made to customers are conditional on the achievement of volume targets, marketing commitments, or both. If paid in advance, we record such payments as prepayments and amortize them over the relevant period to which the customer commitment is made (generally up to&#160;five&#160;years). When the payment is not for a distinct good or service, or fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, the amortization of the prepayment or the cost as incurred is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Where a distinct good or service is received and fair value can be reasonably estimated, the cost is included as marketing, general and administrative expenses. The amounts deferred are reassessed regularly for recoverability over the contract period and are impaired where there is objective evidence that the benefits will not be realized or the asset is otherwise not recoverable. Separately, as discussed below, we analyze whether these advance payments contain a significant financing component for potential adjustment to the transaction price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our primary revenue generating activity represents the sale of beer and other malt beverages to customers, including both domestic and exported product sales. Our customer could be a distributor, retail or on-premise outlet, depending on the market. The majority of our revenues are generated from brands that we own and brew ourselves, however, we also import or brew and sell certain non-owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. In addition, primarily in the U.K., as well as certain other countries in our Europe segment, we sell other beverage companies' products to on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. We refer to this as the factored brand business. Sales from this business are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold. In the factored brand business, we normally purchase inventory, which includes excise taxes charged by the vendor, take orders from customers for such brands, negotiate with the customers on pricing and invoice customers for the product and related costs of delivery. In addition, we incur the risk of loss at times we are in possession of the inventory and for the receivables due from the customers. Revenues for owned brands, partner and imported brands, as well as factored brands are recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer as discussed above. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;&gt;Other Revenue Generating Activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We contract manufacture for other brewers in some of our markets. These contractual agreements require us to brew, package and ship certain brands to these brewers, who then sell the products to their own customers in their respective markets. Revenues under contract brewing arrangements are recognized when our obligation related to the finished product is fulfilled and control of the product transfers to these other brewers.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We also have licensing agreements with third party partners who brew and distribute our products in various markets across our segments. Under these agreements, we are compensated based on the amount of products sold by our partners in these markets at an agreed upon royalty rate or profit percentage. We apply the sales-based royalty practical expedient to these licensing arrangements and recognize revenue as product is sold by our partners at the agreed upon rate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We have evaluated these other revenue generating activities under the disaggregation disclosure criteria outlined within the guidance and concluded that these other revenue generating activities are immaterial for separate disclosure. See &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=#s01E31A3AAEF356908A4A4EAC11E8E7D0 style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Note 3, Segment Reporting
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; for disclosure of revenues by geographic segment.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;&gt;Variable Consideration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our revenue generating activities include variable consideration which is recorded as a reduction of the transaction price based upon expected amounts at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. For example, customer promotional discount programs are entered into with certain distributors for certain periods of time. The amount ultimately reimbursed to distributors is determined based upon agreed-upon promotional discounts which are applied to distributors' sales to retailers. Other common forms of variable consideration include volume rebates for meeting established sales targets, and coupons and mail-in rebates offered to the end consumer. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recorded. We estimate this variable consideration, including analyzing for a potential constraint on variable consideration, by taking into account factors such as the nature of the promotional activity, historical information and current trends, availability of actual results, and expectations of customer and consumer behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We do not have standard terms that permit return of product; however, in certain markets where returns occur we estimate the amount of returns as variable consideration based on historical return experience and adjust our revenue accordingly. Products that do not meet our high quality standards are returned by the customer or recalled and destroyed and are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The reversal of revenue is recorded upon determination that the product will be recalled and destroyed. We estimate the costs required to facilitate product returns and record them in cost of goods sold as required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;During the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;twelve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; months ended &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;December&#160;31, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; and December 31, 2018, adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied in the prior period due to changes in estimates in variable consideration were immaterial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;&gt;Significant Financing Component and Costs to Obtain Contracts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;In certain of our businesses where such practices are legally permitted, we make loans or advanced payments to retail outlets that sell our brands. For arrangements that do not span greater than one year, we apply the practical expedient available under ASC 606 and do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a potential significant financing component. We further analyze arrangements that span greater than one year on an ongoing basis to determine whether a significant financing component exists.

Additionally, our cost of goods sold include both direct and indirect labor, shipping and handling including freight costs, utilities, maintenance costs, warehousing costs, purchasing and receiving costs, depreciation, promotional packaging, other manufacturing overheads and costs to purchase factored and other non-owned brands from suppliers, as well as the estimated cost to facilitate product returns. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our marketing, general and administrative expenses include media advertising (television, radio, digital, print), tactical advertising (signs, banners, point-of-sale materials) and promotion costs on both local and national levels within our operating segments. The creative portion of our advertising activities is expensed as incurred. Production costs of advertising and promotional materials are expensed when the advertising is first run.

These costs primarily consist of labor and outside services, as well as bad debt expense related to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP, legal costs are expensed when incurred. These costs also include our marketing and sales organizations, including labor and other overheads. This line item additionally includes amortization costs associated with intangible assets, as well as certain depreciation costs related to non-production equipment and share-based compensation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Share-based compensation is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period of the awards. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. Our share-based compensation plan and the awards within it contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon change in control, retirement, disability or death of eligible employees and directors. Our share-based awards are considered vested when the employee's retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing service, which for certain awards can result in immediate recognition for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or accelerated recognition for awards granted to individuals that will become retirement eligible within the stated vesting period. Also, if less than the stated vesting period, we recognize these costs over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Special Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that either we do not believe to be indicative of our core operations, or we believe are significant to our current operating results warranting separate classification; specifically, such items are considered to be one of the following:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-left:78px;padding-top:4px;&gt;&lt;span style=padding-top:4px;font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;padding-right:18px;&gt;&#x2022;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;infrequent or unusual items, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-left:78px;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;padding-right:18px;&gt;&#x2022;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;impairment or asset abandonment-related losses,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-left:78px;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;padding-right:18px;&gt;&#x2022;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;restructuring charges and other atypical employee-related costs, or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-left:78px;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;padding-right:18px;&gt;&#x2022;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;fees on termination of significant operating agreements and gains (losses) on disposal of investments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;The items classified as special items are not necessarily non-recurring, however, they are deemed to be incremental to income earned or costs incurred by the company in conducting normal operations, and therefore are presented separately from other components of operating income. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Interest Expense, net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our interest costs are associated with borrowings to finance our operations and acquisitions. Interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents across our business is recorded as interest income. Changes in estimates (if any) to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest liabilities, which are presented within accounts payable and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, are also recognized within interest expense. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We capitalize interest cost as a part of the original cost of acquiring certain fixed assets if the cost of the capital expenditure and the expected time to complete the project are considered significant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Other Income (Expense)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our other income (expense) classification primarily includes gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to our operations. For instance, aggregate unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement and settlement of foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, as well as certain gains or losses on sales of non-operating assets and the mark-to-market activity associated with warrants are classified in this line item. These gains and losses are reported in the operating segment in which they occur; however, foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances related to financing and other treasury-related activities are reported within the Corporate segment. The initial recording of foreign-denominated transactions are classified based on the nature of the transaction, with the unrealized or realized foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the subsequent remeasurement of the monetary asset or liability, and its ultimate settlement, classified in other income (expense). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Income Taxes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets, liabilities, and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We apply the intraperiod tax allocation rules to allocate our provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings, such as other comprehensive income (loss), when we meet the criteria prescribed by U.S. GAAP. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We annually distribute cash from our foreign subsidiaries&#x2019; current year earnings and record the tax impacts associated with these transactions.&#160;Any current earnings not otherwise distributed or planned to be distributed in the current year are considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations.&#160;The aggregate of these earnings is currently a deficit for U.S. tax purposes and would not result in any material taxes, if distributed. We have no plans to dispose of foreign subsidiaries and would not expect outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries to reverse with material tax consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits. We measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest, penalties and offsetting positions related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We account for the&#160;tax effects&#160;of global intangible low-taxed income (&#x201c;GILTI&#x201d;) as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises, to the extent applicable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;OCI represents income and losses for the reporting period, including the related tax impacts, which are excluded from net income (loss) and recognized directly within AOCI as a component of equity. OCI also includes amounts reclassified to income during the reporting period that were previously recognized within AOCI. Amounts remaining within AOCI are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI in the future, at which point they will be recognized within the consolidated statement of operations as a component of net income (loss). We recognize OCI related to the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than USD, unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion of our derivatives designated in cash flow and net investment hedging relationships, actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, as well as our proportionate share of our equity method investments' OCI. Additionally, when we do not have the expectation or intent to cash settle certain of our intercompany note receivable and note payable positions in the foreseeable future, the remeasurement of these instruments is recorded as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments within OCI. We release stranded tax effects from AOCI using either a specific identification approach or portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Earnings Per Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Basic EPS was computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the additional dilutive effect of our potentially dilutive securities, which include RSUs, DSUs, PSUs, and stock options. The dilutive effects of our potentially dilutive securities are calculated using the treasury stock method. Our calculation of weighted-average shares includes Class A common stock and Class B common stock, and Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares. All classes of stock have in effect the same dividend rights and share equitably in undistributed earnings. Holders of Class A common stock receive dividends only to the extent dividends are declared and paid to holders of Class B common stock. See &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=#sCC5D3F33E8C45CE19B6C47CF970C5B02 style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Note 8, Stockholders' Equity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; for further discussion of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock and Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares.

The adoption of this guidance in 2018 did not have a significant impact to our core revenue generating activities. However, it did result in the reclassification of certain cash payments to customers from marketing, general and administrative expenses to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;reduction of revenue. This classification change resulted in a reduction of revenue and marketing, general and administrative expenses by approximately&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$60 million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&#160;during&#160;2018 versus 2017, which is presented under historical U.S. GAAP, primarily within our Canada segment. The adoption of this guidance also resulted in a change in the timing of recognition of certain promotional discounts and cash payments to customers, which shifted financial statement recognition primarily amongst quarters, however, the full-year impact was not significant to our financial results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our net sales represent the sale of beer, malt beverages and other adjacencies, net of excise tax. Sales are stated net of incentives, discounts and returns. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer, however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms. Where our products are sold under consignment arrangements, revenue is not recognized until control has transferred, which is when the product is sold to the end customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product. The cost of various programs, such as price promotions, rebates and coupons are treated as a reduction of sales. In certain of our markets, we make cash payments to customers such as slotting or listing fees, or payments for other marketing or promotional activities. These cash payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless we receive a distinct good or service as defined under ASC 606. Specifically, a good or service is considered distinct when it is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract, we receive a benefit from the good or service, and the benefit is separable from the sale of our product to the customer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Certain payments made to customers are conditional on the achievement of volume targets, marketing commitments, or both. If paid in advance, we record such payments as prepayments and amortize them over the relevant period to which the customer commitment is made (generally up to&#160;five&#160;years). When the payment is not for a distinct good or service, or fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, the amortization of the prepayment or the cost as incurred is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Where a distinct good or service is received and fair value can be reasonably estimated, the cost is included as marketing, general and administrative expenses. The amounts deferred are reassessed regularly for recoverability over the contract period and are impaired where there is objective evidence that the benefits will not be realized or the asset is otherwise not recoverable. Separately, as discussed below, we analyze whether these advance payments contain a significant financing component for potential adjustment to the transaction price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our primary revenue generating activity represents the sale of beer and other malt beverages to customers, including both domestic and exported product sales. Our customer could be a distributor, retail or on-premise outlet, depending on the market. The majority of our revenues are generated from brands that we own and brew ourselves, however, we also import or brew and sell certain non-owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. In addition, primarily in the U.K., as well as certain other countries in our Europe segment, we sell other beverage companies' products to on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. We refer to this as the factored brand business. Sales from this business are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold. In the factored brand business, we normally purchase inventory, which includes excise taxes charged by the vendor, take orders from customers for such brands, negotiate with the customers on pricing and invoice customers for the product and related costs of delivery. In addition, we incur the risk of loss at times we are in possession of the inventory and for the receivables due from the customers. Revenues for owned brands, partner and imported brands, as well as factored brands are recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer as discussed above. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;&gt;Other Revenue Generating Activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We contract manufacture for other brewers in some of our markets. These contractual agreements require us to brew, package and ship certain brands to these brewers, who then sell the products to their own customers in their respective markets. Revenues under contract brewing arrangements are recognized when our obligation related to the finished product is fulfilled and control of the product transfers to these other brewers.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We also have licensing agreements with third party partners who brew and distribute our products in various markets across our segments. Under these agreements, we are compensated based on the amount of products sold by our partners in these markets at an agreed upon royalty rate or profit percentage. We apply the sales-based royalty practical expedient to these licensing arrangements and recognize revenue as product is sold by our partners at the agreed upon rate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We have evaluated these other revenue generating activities under the disaggregation disclosure criteria outlined within the guidance and concluded that these other revenue generating activities are immaterial for separate disclosure.

We have established policies and procedures that govern the risk management of these exposures. Our primary objective in managing these exposures is to decrease the volatility of cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and prices. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;To achieve our objectives, we enter into a variety of financial derivatives, including foreign currency exchange, commodity, interest rate, cross currency swaps as well as options. We also enter into physical hedging agreements directly with our suppliers to manage our exposure to certain commodities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Counterparty Risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;While, by policy, the counterparties to any of the financial derivatives we enter into are major institutions with investment grade credit ratings of at least A- by Standard&#160;&amp;amp; Poor's (or the equivalent) or A3 by Moody's, we are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties. This credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts, should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We have established a counterparty credit policy and guidelines that are monitored and reported to management according to prescribed guidelines to assist in managing this risk. As an additional measure, we utilize a portfolio of institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries that we conduct our business. In calculating the fair value of our derivative balances, we also record an adjustment to recognize the risk of counterparty credit and our own non-performance risk, as appropriate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Price and Liquidity Risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We base the fair value of our derivative instruments upon market rates and prices. The volatility of these rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. The current fair values of our contracts could differ significantly from the cash settled values with our counterparties. As such, we are exposed to price risk related to unfavorable changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date upon the occurrence of certain contractual triggers including a change of control, termination event or other breach of agreement. This could have a negative impact on our liquidity. For derivative contracts that we have designated as hedging instruments, early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the forecasted transaction or firm commitment. We may also decide to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date through negotiations with our counterparties, which could also impact our cash position.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Due to the nature of our counterparty agreements, we are not able to net positions with the same counterparty across business units. Thus, in the event of default, we may be required to early settle all out-of-the-money contracts, without the benefit of netting the fair value of any in-the-money positions against this exposure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Collateral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We do not receive and are not required to post collateral unless a change of control event occurs. This termination event would give either party the right to early terminate all outstanding swap transactions in the event that the other party consolidates, merges with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another entity, and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity that has assumed such party's obligations is materially weaker than that of such party. As of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;December&#160;31, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;, we did not have any collateral posted with any of our counterparties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Derivative Accounting Policies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;&gt;Overview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Our foreign currency forwards and our forward starting interest rate swaps are designated in hedging relationships as cash flow hedges, and our cross currency swaps are designated as net investment hedges. Prior to settlements discussed below, our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges. In certain situations, we may execute derivatives that do not qualify for, or we do not otherwise seek, hedge accounting but are determined to be important for managing risk. For example, our commodity swaps and commodity options are not designated in hedge accounting relationships. These outstanding economic hedges are measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. We have historically elected to apply the NPNS exemption to certain contracts, as applicable. These contracts are typically transacted with our suppliers and include risk management features that allow us to fix the price on specific volumes of purchases for specified delivery periods. We also consider whether any provisions in our contracts represent embedded derivative instruments as defined in authoritative accounting guidance and apply the appropriate accounting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;&gt;Hedge Accounting Policies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We formally document all relationships receiving hedge accounting treatment between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions pursuant to prescribed guidance. We also formally assess effectiveness both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, specifically whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in mitigating the risk designated as being hedged and whether those hedges may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Specific to net investment hedges, we have elected to use the spot-to-spot methodology to assess effectiveness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1)&#160;the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a forecasted future transaction; (2)&#160;the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3)&#160;it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; (4)&#160;management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate; or (5)&#160;management decides to cease hedge accounting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;When we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, but it continues to be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, the existing gain or loss on the derivative remains in AOCI for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or in the carrying value of the hedged item for fair value hedges and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we carry the derivative at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheets until maturity, recognizing future changes in the fair value in current period earnings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;&gt;Significant Derivative/Hedge Positions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;&gt;Interest Rate Swaps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;During the fourth quarter of 2017, we voluntarily settled our interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$1.0 billion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;, which were previously entered into earlier in 2017 to economically convert our fixed rate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$1.0 billion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; 2017 USD Notes to floating rate debt based on a credit spread plus the one-month LIBOR rate.

These swaps were previously designated as fair value hedges with the changes in fair value of the hedged item recognized in earnings. At the time of settlement we ceased adjusting the carrying value of the two &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$500 million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; notes for the fair value movements and these cumulative adjustments are now being amortized as a charge to interest expense over the expected remaining term of the respective note.

During the third quarter of 2018, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$1.5 billion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;. The forward starting interest rate swaps have an effective date of July 2018 and termination dates of July 2021, May 2022 and July 2026, mirroring the terms of the forecasted debt issuances. Weighted-average interest rates on the swaps are fixed at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.00%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.01%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.10%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; for July 2021, May 2022 and July 2026, respectively. Under the agreements we are required to early terminate these swaps at the time we expect to issue the related forecasted debt. We have designated these contracts as cash flow hedges. As a result, the unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will be recorded to AOCI until termination at which point the realized gain or loss of these swaps at issuance of the hedged debt will be reclassified from AOCI and amortized to interest expense over the term of the hedged debt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;In 2015 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional of CAD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;600 million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; in order to manage our exposure to the volatility of the interest rates associated with the future interest payments on the forecasted CAD debt issuances, which ultimately became the 2015 Notes and a portion of the 2016 Notes. The swaps had an effective date of September 2015 and a termination date of September 2025 mirroring the terms of the initially forecasted CAD debt issuance.

These contracts allow us to swap our floating exposure to changes in these commodity prices for a fixed rate. These contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships. As such, changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. We hedge forecasted purchases of natural gas, aluminum, corn and diesel each up to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span&gt;60 months&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt; out in the future for use in our supply chain, in line with our risk management policy. Further, we hedge forecasted purchases of barley based on crop year and physical inventory management. For purposes of measuring segment operating performance, the unrealized changes in fair value of the swaps not designated in hedge accounting relationships are reported in Corporate outside of the segment specific operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing is realized. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from Corporate to the operating segment, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of the derivative without the resulting unrealized mark-to-market volatility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;&gt;Warrants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:10px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;On &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;October&#160;4, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;, in connection with the formation of the Truss joint venture, as discussed further in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=#s70195425236D56F4B0E444596DD13CED style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;&gt;Note 4, Investments
