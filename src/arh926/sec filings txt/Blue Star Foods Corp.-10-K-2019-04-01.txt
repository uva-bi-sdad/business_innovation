PART
I

ITEM
1. BUSINESS



We
were incorporated on October 17
 2017 in the State of Delaware as a blank check company to be used as a vehicle to pursue a business
combination with an unidentified target. Since inception
 and prior to the Merger (as defined below)
 we only engaged in organizational
efforts. Following the Merger
 we discontinued our prior activities of seeking a business for a merger or acquisition and acquired
the business of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.
 d/b/a Blue Star Foods
 a Florida corporation formed on May 5
 1995 (&ldquo;Keeler
&amp; Co&rdquo;).

On
November 8
 2018 (the &ldquo;Closing Date&rdquo;)
 we consummated a merger (the &ldquo;Merger&rdquo;) pursuant to the terms of
an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;) by and among the Company
 Blue Star Acquisition
Corp.
 a newly formed
 wholly-owned Florida subsidiary of the Company (&ldquo;Acquisition Sub&rdquo;)
 Keeler &amp; Co
 and John
Keeler
 Keeler &amp; Co&rsquo;s sole stockholder (the &ldquo;Keeler &amp; Co Stockholder&rdquo;). As a result of the Merger
 effective
as of November 8
 2018
 Acquisition Sub merged with and into Keeler &amp; Co
 and Keeler &amp; Co became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company.

In
connection with the Merger
 the Company changed its name from &ldquo;AG Acquisition Group II
 Inc.&rdquo; to &ldquo;Blue Star
Foods Corp.&rdquo; and succeeded to the business of Keeler &amp; Co
 an international seafood company that imports
 packages and
sells refrigerated pasteurized crab meat
 and other premium seafood products
 including crab cakes
 finfish and wakami salad
as its sole line of business.

At
the Closing Date
 each of the 500 shares of Keeler &amp; Co&rsquo;s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
closing of the Merger was exchanged for 30
000 shares of our common stock
 $0.0001 par value per share (&ldquo;Common Stock&rdquo;).
As a result
 an aggregate of 15
000
000 shares of our Common Stock were issued to the Keeler &amp; Co Stockholder.

Concurrently
with the closing of the Merger
 we held an initial closing of our private placement offering (the &ldquo;Offering&rdquo;) of a
minimum of $700
000 and a maximum of $3
200
000 of units of our securities (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo;)
 in which we sold 725 Units
at a purchase price of $1
000 per Unit
 for aggregate gross proceeds of $725
000. Each Unit consisted of one share of the Company&rsquo;s
8% Series A convertible preferred stock
 par value $0.0001 per share (the &ldquo;Series A Stock&rdquo;)
 initially convertible
into shares (the &ldquo;Conversion Shares&rdquo;) of the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock
 at a conversion rate of $2.00 per share
and (ii) a three-year warrant (the &ldquo;Warrant&rdquo;) to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock for every share of
Common Stock that would be received upon conversion of a share of Series A Stock (the &ldquo;Warrant Shares&rdquo;)
 at an exercise
price equal to $2.40.

On
November 8
 2018
 we entered into a registration rights agreement (the &ldquo;Registration Rights Agreement&rdquo;) with the investors
in the Offering. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement
 within 120 business days after the closing of the
Offering
 the Company is obligated toll file a registration statement (the &ldquo;Registration Statement&rdquo;) with the SEC
covering the Conversion Shares and the Warrant Shares (collectively
 the &ldquo;Registrable Shares&rdquo;) and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective and to keep such Registration Statement effective
for a period of twelve months or for such shorter period ending on the earlier to occur of (x) the sale of all Registrable Securities
and (y) the availability of Rule 144 for the sale of the Registrable Securities without volume limitations within a 90 day period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing
 in the event that the SEC limits the number of Registrable Securities that may be sold pursuant
to the Registration Statement
 the Company may remove from the Registration Statement such number of Registrable Securities as
specified by the SEC on a pro-rata basis (the &ldquo;SEC Cutback&rdquo;). The holders of Registrable Shares will have &ldquo;piggyback&rdquo;
registration rights for such Registrable Shares with respect to two registration statements in accordance with the terms and the
notice requirements of the Registration Rights Agreement
 subject to a SEC Cutback or a customary cutback in an underwritten offering
both which would be pro rata.

Effective
upon the closing of the Merger
 we issued an aggregate of 688 Units to eleven individuals and entities (the &ldquo;Settlement
Parties&rdquo;) in consideration for each such individual or entity entering into a settlement and mutual general release agreement
(the &ldquo;Settlement Agreement&rdquo;) with the Company in full and complete settlement and satisfaction and release of claims
such Settlement Parties may have against the Company (the &ldquo;Company Settlement&rdquo;).


    
    


Also
in connection with the Merger
 the Company redeemed an aggregate of 9
250
000 shares of Common Stock from the Company&rsquo;s
pre-Merger stockholders (the &ldquo;Pre-Merger Holders&rdquo;) for cancellation by the Company (the &ldquo;Share Redemption&rdquo;).
The Pre-Merger Holders retained an aggregate of 750
000 shares of our Common Stock after the Merger. The shares were surrendered
in consideration for the direct benefit the Pre-Merger Holders will receive in connection with the consummation of the Merger.

Our
authorized capital stock currently consists of 100
000
000 shares of Common Stock
 and 5
000
000 shares of the preferred stock
of which 10
000 shares have been designated as Series A Stock. Our Common Stock is not traded on any exchange or quoted on the
OTC Markets
 and there is no public market for our Common Stock.

Company
Overview

We
are an international seafood company that imports
 packages and sells refrigerated pasteurized crab meat
 and other premium seafood
products. Our current source of revenue is from importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Indonesia
 Philippines
and China and distributing it in the United States
 Canada and Europe under several premium brand names such as Blue Star
 Oceanica
Pacifika
 Crab &amp; Go and Harbor Banks. Our products are also sold in Mexico
 Central America
 the Caribbean
 the European Union
the United Arab Emirates
 Singapore and Hong Kong. The crab meat which we import is processed in 14 plants throughout Southeast
Asia. Our suppliers are primarily via co-packing relationships
 including two affiliated suppliers. We sell primarily to food
service distributors. We also sell our products to wholesalers
 retail establishments and seafood distributors. See &ldquo;Description
of Business&rdquo; below.

Our
premium proprietary brands are differentiated in terms of quality and price point.

We
believe that we utilize best-in-class technology
 in both resource sustainability management and ecological packaging.

The
Company&rsquo;s executive offices and warehouse facility are based in Miami
 Florida Additionally
 the Company may
 from time
to time
 utilize third party warehouses located in Miami
 Baltimore
 Philadelphia and Los Angeles.



Our
strategy is to create a vertically integrated seafood company that offers customers high quality products while maintaining a
focus on our core values of delivering food safety
 traceability and certified sustainability.

We
plan to grow the Company organically by continuing to grow our customer base
 offering additional species to our customers
 introducing
new value-added product lines and strategically acquiring companies that we believe we can integrate into a larger
 vertically
integrated company.

Competitive
Strengths -Sustainable and Traceable Product Sourcing

We
believe that our greatest point of differentiation from other seafood companies are our efforts to ensure that our seafood products
are ethically sourced in a method that is consistent with our core values and those of our customers.

We
purchase the majority of our crab product from processors which source the crab meat from local fishermen in Indonesia
 the Philippines
Thailand
 Vietnam
 Sri Lanka and India
 to whom we pay a premium in order to outfit their boats with a proprietary GPS-based system.
This system allows us to trace where the crab product originates and ensure that only mature crabs are being harvested by the
use of collapsible traps and not gill nets.

We
have created a technology platform that tracks the product through its entire chain of custody and collects and transmits various
data to the Company in real-time
 from the loading site
 to the packing plant
 through the sorting and pasteurization process
and the exporting process to the end customer. Our technology allows our customers access to their &ldquo;Scan on Demand&rdquo;
QR code-enabled traceability application.


    
    


The
crab meat is purchased directly from processors with whom we have long-standing relationships
 that have agreed to source their
product in a sustainable manner. All crab meat is sourced under the Company&rsquo;s FDA approved Hazard Analysis Critical Control
Point (&ldquo;HACCP&rdquo;) Plan. Additionally
 all suppliers are certified by the British Retail Consortium (the &ldquo;BRC&rdquo;)
and are audited annually to ensure safety and quality of our product.

In
general
 the international seafood industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with local and overseas
manufacturers and importers engaged in similar products.

The
Company&rsquo;s primary competitors are Tri Union Frozen Products
 Inc. (Chicken of the Sea Frozen Foods)
 Phillips Foods
 Inc.
Harbor Seafood
 Inc.
 Bonamar Corporation and Twin Tails Seafood Corp.

Industry
Overview

The
international seafood industry is going through a period of rapid change as it strives to meet the needs of a growing population
around the world
 where food consumption habits are evolving. We believe there are powerful trends emerging in the developing
world (including a growing demand for animal-based protein) as well as and in the developed world (where there is an increased
awareness and focus on sustainable sourcing and protecting marine ecosystems).

Population
Growth and Global Seafood Consumption



    
&#9679;
    
The
    United Nations estimates that there will be close to 9.8 billion people on our planet by the year 2050(1)
 a significant increase
    from the existing population estimates of 7.6 billion. (1)

    
    
    

    
    
United
    Nations &ndash; Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2017)




    
    
As
    the population has grown
 so has per capita consumption. World per capita apparent fish consumption increased from an average
    of 9.9 kg in the 1960s to 14.4 kg in the 1990s and 19.7 kg in 2013
 with preliminary estimates for 2014 and 2015 pointing
    towards further growth beyond 20 kg. (2)

Sources
of Seafood



    
&#9679;
    
Global
    total capture fishery production in 2014 was 93.4 million tons
 of which 81.5 million tons from marine waters and 11.9 million
    tons from inland waters (3).

&#9679;
    
Where
    seafood comes is sourced is changing in order to meet the demand. In 2014
 a milestone was reached when the aquaculture sector&rsquo;s
    contribution to the supply of fish for human consumption overtook that of wild-caught fish for the first time (4).

Industry Participants



    
    
The
    mix of parties involved in seafood varies from the local village fisherman
 to large
 international
 vertically-integrated
    seafood companies. 

    
    
    

    
&#9679;
    
The
    total number of fishing vessels in the world in 2014 is estimated at about 4.6 million
 with the fleet in Asia being the largest
    consisting of 3.5 million vessels and accounting for 75 percent of the global fleet
 followed by Africa (15%)
 Latin America
    and the Caribbean (6%)
 North America (2%) and Europe (2%) (5).

Growth
Strategy

We
intend to grow the business organically and through strategic acquisitions.

Organic
growth &ndash; We believe that allocating additional capital to our existing business plan will allow us to continue to meet growing
demand from end-customers for seafood products. The Company also currently intends to introduce new species
 including lobster
tails
 fin fish and other specialty seafood proteins in the next 18 months.

Acquisitions
&ndash;We also currently intend to evaluate strategic acquisitions in the fragmented seafood industry. We believe that such potential
acquisitions may add value in several ways
 including geographical diversification and new specifies offerings
 as well as operational
and price synergies.



We
currently have four products: Blue Star
 Pacifika
 Oceanica
 and Crab &amp; Go Premium Seafood.

Blue
Star is packed with only high quality Portunus Pelagicus species crab and is produced under exacting specifications and quality
control requirements.

Pacifika
is a quality brand for the price conscious end-user. The Portunus Haanii crab meat is packed in China and is ideal for upscale
plate presentations.

Oceanica
is made from the Portunus Haanii crab
 which is caught and processed in Vietnam. It is an affordable choice to help reduce food
cost without sacrificing the look / taste of dishes.


    
    


Grab
+ Go Premium Seafood is geared towards millennials as part of the trend toward pre-packaged
 grab-and-go items. The product is
packaged in flexible foil pouches.



We
purchase crab meat directly from 14 processors with which we have long-standing relationships
 that have agreed to source their
product in a sustainable manner. All crab meat is sourced under the Company&rsquo;s FDA approved HACCP Plan. Additionally
 all
suppliers are certified by the BRC and are audited annually to ensure safety and quality.

The
Company has two suppliers which accounted for approximately 76% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended December
31
 2018. These two suppliers are located in Indonesia and the Philippines
 which accounted for approximately 93% of the Company&rsquo;s
total purchases during 2018. These suppliers included Bacolod Blue Star Export Corp. (&ldquo;Bacolod&rdquo;)
 an affiliated party
based in the Philippines
 which accounted for approximately 49% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during 2018. Five non-affiliated
suppliers
 PT Siger Jaya Abadi of Indonesia
 PT Blue Star Anugrah of Indonesia
 PT Bumi Menara Interusa of Indonesia
 PT Nuansa
Cipta Magello and PT Muria Bahari Indonesia made up the balance of the 44% of the supply concentration.

segments. The sales team and brokers help to pull the products through the system by creating demand at the end user level and
pulling the demand through our distributor customers. We sell to retail customers either directly or via distributors that specialize
in the retail segment.

The
Company does not own its own fleet of trucks and utilizes &ldquo;LTL&rdquo; national freight carriers to deliver its products
to its customers. Less than truckload freight shipping (&ldquo;LTL&rdquo;) is used for the transportation of small freight or
when freight does not require the use of an entire trailer. When shipping LTL
 we pay for a portion of a standard truck trailer
and other shippers and their shipments fill the unoccupied space.

Our
Technology

We
have created a technology platform that tracks the product through its entire chain of custody and collects and transmits various
data to the Company in real-time
 from the loading site
 to the packing plant
 through the sorting and pasteurization process
and the exporting process to the end customer. Our technology allows our customers access to their &ldquo;Scan on Demand&rdquo;
QR code-enabled traceability application.



Our
customer base is comprised of some of the largest companies in the food service and retail industry. We sell our crab meat to
our customers through purchase orders. Currently
 almost 63% of our revenue is derived from fortune 500 customers. For the fiscal
year ended December 31
 2018
 sales to food distributors accounted for 57% of our revenue
 sales to large buying cooperatives
accounted for 11% of our revenue
 and sales to retail and wholesale clubs accounting for 11% of our revenue. The balance of our
revenue derived from smaller seafood distributors and value-added processors.

Our
sales are diversified geographically throughout the United States
 with Florida being the largest geographic concentration at
17% of sales. As typical in the seafood industry
 a large portion of our revenue is located along the eastern seaboard with 42%
of our revenue derived from sales to customers along the East Coast from Massachusetts to Florida. International sales directly
or through our affiliate in the United Kingdom
 Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. make up roughly 3% of revenue.


    
    


The
Company had three customers which accounted for approximately 65% of revenue during the year ended December 31
 2018. Outstanding
receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 67% of the total accounts receivable as of December 31
 2018. The
loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
position.

Intellectual
Property

Our
intellectual property is an essential element of our business. We use a combination of patent
 trademark
 copyright
 trade secret
and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our policy is to seek
patent protection in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions for our products
 processes and other technology where

Government
Regulation

Our
distribution facility in Florida and our international suppliers are certified in accordance with the HACCP
 standards for exporting
aquatic products to the United States. The HACCP standards are developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &ldquo;FDA&rdquo;)
pursuant to the FDA&rsquo;s HACCP regulation
 Title 21
 Code of Federal Regulations
 part 123
 and are used by the FDA to help
ensure food safety and control sanitary standards.

Food
Safety and Labeling

We
are subject to extensive regulation
 including
 among other things
 the Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act
 as amended by the Food Safety
Modernization Act (&ldquo;FSMA&rdquo;)
 the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002
 and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. FSMA was enacted in order to aid the effective prevention of food
safety issues in the food supply. This comprehensive and evolving regulatory program will impact how food is grown
 packed
 processed
shipped and imported into the United States and will govern compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (&ldquo;GMPs&rdquo;).
The FDA has finalized seven major rules to implement FSMA
 recognizing that ensuring the safety of the food supply is a shared
responsibility among many different points in the global supply chain. The FSMA rules are designed to make clear specific actions
that must be taken at each of these points to prevent contamination. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard
for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations
 we may be subject to
civil remedies
 including fines
 injunctions
 recalls
 or seizures
 and criminal sanctions
 any of which could impact our results
of operations.

In
addition
 the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 prescribes the format and content of certain information required to
appear on the labels of food products.

Our
operations and products are also subject to state and local regulation
 including the registration and licensing of plants
 enforcement
by state health agencies of various state standards
 and the registration and inspection of facilities. Compliance with federal
state and local regulation is costly and time-consuming. Enforcement actions for violations of federal
 state
 and local regulations
may include seizure and condemnation of products
 cease and desist orders
 injunctions or monetary penalties. We believe that
our practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations.


    
    




For
the purchase of products harvested or manufactured outside of the United States
 and for the shipment of products to customers
located outside of the United States
 we are subject to customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments. Our activities
including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders
 are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection
part of the Department of Homeland Security.

Federal
Trade Commission

We
are subject to certain regulations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Advertising of our products is subject to such regulation
pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

Employee
Safety Regulations

We
are subject to certain health and safety regulations
 including regulations issued pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health
Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing
 health
 and safety standards to protect our employees
from accidents.



Because
we are organized under the laws of a state in the U.S. and our principal place of business is in the U.S.
 we are considered a
&ldquo;domestic concern&rdquo; under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&ldquo;FCPA&rdquo;) and are covered by the anti-bribery
provisions of the FCPA. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit any domestic concern and any officer
 director
 employee
or agent
 acting on behalf of the domestic concern from paying or authorizing payment of anything of value to (i) influence any
act or decision by a foreign official; (ii) induce a foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his/her lawful
duty; (iii) secure any improper advantage; or (iv) induce a foreign official to use his/her influence to assist the payor in obtaining
or retaining business
 or directing business to another person.

Environmental
Regulation

We
are subject to a number of federal
 state
 and local laws and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment
and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These requirements relate to a broad range of our activities
 including:
the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the identification
 generation
 storage
 handling
 transportation
 disposal
recordkeeping
 labeling
 and reporting of
 and emergency response in connection with
 hazardous materials (including asbestos)
associated with our operations; noise emissions from our facilities; and safety and health standards
 practices
 and procedures
that apply to the workplace and the operation of our facilities. Insurance

We
maintain general liability and product liability
 property
 worker&rsquo;s compensation and business interruption insurance and
are in the process of obtaining director and officer insurance in amounts and on terms that we believe are customary for companies
similarly situated. In addition
 we maintain excess insurance where we believe it is reasonably cost effective.



As
of March 29
 2019
 we have sixteen full time employees and one part-time employee. We believe that our future success will depend
in part
 on our continued ability to attract
 hire and retain qualified personnel.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS

THIS
ANNUAL REPORT CONTAINS CERTAIN STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE EVENTS OR THE FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPANY. YOU ARE
CAUTIONED THAT SUCH STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS AND INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
 AND THAT ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY
DIFFER MATERIALLY. IN EVALUATING SUCH STATEMENTS
 YOU SHOULD SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER THE VARIOUS FACTORS IDENTIFIED IN THIS ANNUAL
REPORT
 INCLUDING THE MATTERS SET FORTH BELOW
 WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED BY SUCH
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.


    
    


AN
INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS BEFORE
DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR COMPANY. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR
 OUR BUSINESS
 FINANCIAL CONDITION
 RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH WOULD LIKELY SUFFER.

Risks
Relating to Our Company and Business

Future
acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.

Selective
acquisitions currently form part of our strategy to further expand our business. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities
we may acquire additional businesses
 services or products that are complementary to our core business. Future acquisitions and
the subsequent integration of new companies into ours would require significant attention from our management. Future acquisitions
would also expose us to potential risks
 including risks associated with the assimilation of new operations
 services and personnel
unforeseen or hidden liabilities
 the diversion of resources from our existing businesses and technologies
 the inability to generate
sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions and potential loss of
 or harm to
 relationships with employees
as a result of integration of new businesses. The diversion of our management&rsquo;s attention and any difficulties encountered
in any integration process could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.

The
value of crab meat is subject to fluctuation which may result in volatility of our results of operations and the value of an investment
in the Company.

Our
business is dependent upon the sale of a commodity which value is subject to fluctuation and which value greatly fluctuates. Our
net sales and operating results vary significantly due to the volatility of the value of the crab meat that we sell which may
result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock.

A
material decline in the population and biomass of crab meat that we sell in the fisheries from which we obtain our crab meat would
materially and adversely affect our business.

The
population and biomass of crab meat are subject to natural fluctuations which are beyond our control and which may be exacerbated
by disease
 reproductive problems or other biological issues and may be affected by changes in weather and global environmental
changes. The overall health of a crab or other fish is difficult to measure
 and fisheries management is still a relatively inexact
science. Since we are unable to predict the timing and extent of fluctuations in the population and biomass of our products
 we
are unable to engage in any measures that might alleviate the adverse effects of these fluctuations. Any such fluctuation which
results in a material decline in the population and biomass in the fisheries from which we obtain our crab meat would materially
and adversely affect our business. Our operations are also subject to the risk of variations in supply.

We
are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.

The
sales of our products may involve the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized personnel
product contamination or spoilage
 including the presence of foreign objects
 substances
 chemicals
 or residues introduced during
the packing
 storage
 handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe
our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations
 including internal product safety policies
we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be
subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful
 the negative publicity
surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential
customers and our brand image.

A
significant portion of our revenues are derived from a single product
 crab meat
 and therefore we are highly susceptible to changes
in market demand
 which may be affected by factors over which we have limited or no control.

A
significant portion of our revenues are derived from a single product
 crab meat. We therefore are highly susceptible to changes
in market demand
 which may be impacted by factors over which we have limited or no control. Factors that could lead to a decline
in market demand for crab meat include economic conditions and evolving consumer preferences. A substantial downturn in market
demand for crab meat may have a material adverse effect on our business and on our results of operations.


    
    


Risks
Related to Our Industry

Regulation
of the fishing industry may have an adverse impact on our business.

The
international community has been aware of and concerned with the worldwide problem of depletion of natural fish stocks. In the
past
 these concerns have resulted in the imposition of quotas that subject individual countries to strict limitations on the
amount of seafood that is allowed to be caught or harvested. Environmental groups have been lobbying for additional limitations.
If international organizations or national governments were to impose additional limitations on crab meat or the seafood products
we sell
 this could have a negative impact on our results of operations.

Segments
of the seafood industry in which we operate are competitive
 and our inability to compete successfully could adversely affect
our business
 results of operations and financial condition.

We
compete with major integrated seafood companies such as Tri Union Frozen Products
 Inc. (Chicken of the Sea Frozen Foods)
 Phillips
Foods
 Inc.
 Harbor Seafood
 Inc.
 Bonamar Corporation and Twin Tails Seafood Corp. Some of our competitors have the benefit of
marketing their products under brand names that have better market recognition than ours or have stronger marketing and distribution
channels than we do. Increased competition as to any of our products could result in price reduction
 reduced margins and loss
of market share
 which could negatively affect our profitability. An increase in imported products in the U.S. at low prices could
also negatively affect our profitability.

Our
insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover losses we may incur or to fully replace a significant loss of assets.

Our
involvement in the fishing industry may result in liability for pollution
 property damage
 personal injury or other hazards.
Although we believe we have obtained insurance in accordance with industry standards to address such risks
 such insurance has
limitations on liability and/or deductible amounts that may not be sufficient to cover the full extent of such liabilities or
losses. In addition
 such risks may not
 in all circumstances
 be insurable or
 in certain circumstances
 we may choose not to
obtain insurance to protect against specific risks due to the high premiums associated with such insurance or for other reasons.
The payment of such uninsured liabilities would reduce the funds available to us. If we suffer a significant event or occurrence
that is not fully insured
 or if the insurer of such event is not solvent
 we could be required to divert funds from capital investment
or other uses towards covering any liability or loss for such events.

Our
operations
 revenue and profitability could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations in the countries where we
do business.

The
governments of countries into which we sell our products
 from time to time
 consider regulatory proposals relating to raw materials
food safety and markets
 and environmental regulations
 which
 if adopted
 could lead to disruptions in distribution of our products
and increase our operational costs
 which
 in turn
 could affect our profitability. To the extent that we increase our product
prices as a result of such changes
 our sales volume and revenues may be adversely affected.

Furthermore
these governments may change import regulations or impose additional taxes or duties on certain imports from time to time. These
regulations and fees or new regulatory developments may have a material adverse impact on our operations
 revenue and profitability.
If one or more of the countries into which we sell our products bars the import or sale of crab meat or related products
 our
available market would shrink significantly
 adversely impacting our results of operations and growth potential.


    
    


A
decline in discretionary consumer spending may adversely affect our industry
 our operations and ultimately our profitability.

Luxury
products
 such as premium grade crab meat
 are discretionary purchases for consumers. Any reduction in consumer discretionary
spending or disposable income may affect the crab meat industry significantly. Many economic factors outside of our control could
affect consumer discretionary spending
 including the financial markets
 consumer credit availability
 prevailing interest rates
energy costs
 employment levels
 salary levels
 and tax rates. Any reduction in discretionary consumer spending could materially
adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Risks
Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties

Our
independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going
concern in its report on our audited financial statements.

The
report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2018 includes an explanatory
paragraph stating that for the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company incurred a net loss of $2
277
116
 has an accumulated
deficit of $3
853
139 and working capital deficit of $1
146
937
 inclusive of $2
910
136 in subordinated stockholder debt. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to increase revenues
 execute on its business plan to acquire complimentary
companies
 raise capital and continue to sustain adequate working capital to finance its operations. If we are unable to do so
our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as
a going concern.

We
are dependent on third parties for our operations.

Our
business is dependent upon our relationships with vendors in Southeast Asia for co-packing
 processing and shipping product to
us. If for any reason these companies became unable or unwilling to continue to provide services to us
 this would likely lead
to a temporary interruption in our ability to import our products until we found another entity that could provide these services.
Failure to find a suitable replacement
 even on a temporary basis
 would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We
are primarily dependent on two suppliers to provide our crab meat product.

The
Company had two suppliers which accounted for approximately 76% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended December
31
 2018. These two suppliers are located in Indonesia and the Philippinesand accounted for approximately 93% of the Company&rsquo;s
total purchases during the year ended December 31
 2018. These suppliers included Bacolod
 which accounted for approximately 49%
of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during 2018. The loss of any major supplier could have a material adverse impact on the
Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial position. John Keeler
 our Executive Chairman
 and Christopher
Constable
 our Chief Financial Officer
 own 75% and 20%
 respectively
 of Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat from the
Philippines
 and Messrs. Keeler and Constable own 80% and 15%
 respectively
 of Bicol Blue Star Export Co.
 a Philippine company
(&ldquo;Bicol&rdquo;)
 and an indirect supplier of crab meat to the Company through Bacolod. Additionally
 Mr. Constable manages
the finance operations of these entities.

Three
customers accounted for the majority of our revenue.

The
Company had three customers which accounted for approximately 65% of revenue during the year ended December 31
 2018. . Outstanding
receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 67% of the total accounts receivable as of December 31
 2018. The
loss of any of any major customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows
and financial position.

All
of our significant customer contracts and some of our supplier contracts are short-term and may not be renewable on terms favorable
to us
 or at all.

All
of our customers and some of our suppliers operate through purchase orders or short-term contracts. Though we have long-term business
relationships with many of our customers and suppliers and alternative sources of supply for key items
 we cannot be sure that
any of these customers or suppliers will continue to do business with us on the same basis. Additionally
 although we try to renew
these contracts as they expire
 there can be no assurance that these customers or suppliers will renew these contracts on terms
that are favorable to us
 if at all. The termination of
 or modification to
 any number of these contracts may adversely affect
our business and prospects
 including our financial performance and results of operations.


    
    


Risks
Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements

We
may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing commercial operations and develop and commercialize new products and
expand our operations.

Based
on our current business plan
 we believe the net proceeds from the Offering
 together with our current cash and cash equivalents
and cash receipts from sales will enable us to conduct our planned operations for at least the next 12 months. If our available
cash balances
 net proceeds from the Offering and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity
requirements including because of lower demand for our products or due to other risks described herein
 we may seek to sell Common
Stock or preferred stock or convertible debt securities
 enter into an additional credit facility or another form of third-party
funding or seek other debt financing.

We
may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business
 to pursue strategic investments
 to take advantage
of financing opportunities or for other reasons
 including to:



    
    
increase
    our sales and marketing efforts and address competitive developments; 

    
    
    

    
    
provide
    for supply and inventory costs; 

    
    
    

    
    
fund
    development and marketing efforts of any future products or additional features to then-current products; 

    
    
    

    
    
acquire
    license or invest in new technologies; 

    
    
    

    
&#9679;
    
acquire
    or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and 

    
    
    

    
    
finance
    capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses. 


Our
present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors
 including:



    
    
our
    ability to achieve revenue growth and improve gross margins; 

    
    
    

    
    
the
    cost of expanding our operations and offerings
 including our sales and marketing efforts; 

    
    
    

    
    
the
    effect of competing market developments; and

    
    
    

    
    
costs
    related to international expansion. 


The
various ways we could raise additional capital carry potential risks. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities
 dilution
to our stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also could provide for rights
 preferences or privileges senior
to those of holders of our Common Stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities
 those debt securities would have rights
preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant
to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing
arrangements
 we might be required to relinquish significant rights or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.

We
will incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management expects to devote substantial time
to public company compliance programs.

As
a public company
 we will incur significant legal
 accounting and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure
obligations applicable to us
 including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 as amended (the &ldquo;Sarbanes-Oxley
Act&rdquo;)
 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &ldquo;Dodd-Frank Act&rdquo;) as well as rules
implemented by the SEC
 and the OTC Markets. Stockholder activism
 the current political environment and the current high level
of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations
 which may
lead to additional compliance costs and impact
 in ways we cannot currently anticipate
 the manner in which we operate our business.
Our management and other personnel will devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of and
compliance with
 public company reporting obligations. These rules and regulations will cause us to incur significant legal and
financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.


    
    


To
comply with the requirements of being a public company
 we may need to undertake various actions
 including implementing new internal
controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our
disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file with the SEC is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms
and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal
executive and financial officers. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate and weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective
controls could negatively impact the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting
firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we may be required
to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 harm our operating results
cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. In the
event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 that our internal control over financial reporting
is perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements
 investors may lose confidence
in our operating results and the price of our Common Stock could decline. In addition
 if we are unable to continue to meet these
requirements
 our Common Stock may not be able to be eligible for quotation on the OTC Markets or meet the eligibility requirements
for the NASDAQ Stock Market(&ldquo;NASDAQ&rdquo;).

We
are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore
not yet required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose.
Upon becoming a public company
 we will be required to comply with certain of these rules
 which will require management to certify
financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report. We are just beginning the costly and
challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation needed to comply with such requirements. We may not be
able to complete our evaluation
 testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process
if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
 we will be unable to assert that
our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Our
independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting until the later of our second annual report or the first annual report required to be filed with the
SEC following the date we are no longer an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; as defined in the JOBS Act depending on whether
we choose to rely on certain exemptions set forth in the JOBS Act. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial
reporting is effective
 or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting
 we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial
reports
 which could harm our business.

    of or sell its assets; 

    
    
    

    
    
make
    material changes in its business; 



    
    




    
    
merge
    with or acquire other entities or assets;

    additional indebtedness; 

    
    
    

    
    
create
    liens on its assets; 

    
    
    

    
    
pay
    dividends; and

    
    
    

    
    
make
    investments. 




covenants in our loan and security agreement
 as well as any future financing agreements into which we may enter
 may restrict
our or our subsidiary&rsquo;s ability to finance operations and engage in
 expand or otherwise pursue business activities
and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control
 and future breaches of
any of these covenants could result in a default under our loan and security agreement. If not waived
 future defaults could cause
all of the outstanding indebtedness under our loan and security agreement to become immediately due and payable and terminate
all commitments to extend further credit.

If
we do not have or are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable
either upon maturity or in the event of a default
 we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable
terms
 if at all
 which may negatively impact our ability to operate and continue our business as a going concern.

We
face risks related to the current global economic environment which could harm our business
 financial condition and results of
operations.

The
state of the global economy continues to be uncertain. The current global economic conditions and uncertain credit markets
 concerns
regarding the availability of credit pose a risk that could impact our international relationships
 as well as our ability to
manage normal commercial relationships with our customers
 suppliers and creditors
 including financial institutions. Global trade
issues and the impositions of tariffs could also have an adverse effect on our international business activities. If the current
global economic environment deteriorates
 our business could be negatively affected.

Risks
Related to Administrative
 Organizational and Commercial Operations and Growth

We
may be unable to manage our future growth effectively
 which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.

We
anticipate growth in our business operations. This future growth could create a strain on our organizational
 administrative and
operational infrastructure
 including manufacturing operations
 quality control
 technical support and customer service
 sales
force management and general and financial administration. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue
to improve our operational
 financial and management controls
 as well as our reporting systems and procedures. If we are unable
to manage our growth effectively
 we may be unable to execute our business plan
 which could have a material adverse effect on
our business and our results of operations.

If
we are unable to support demand for our current and our future products
 including ensuring that we have adequate resources to
meet increased demand our business could be harmed.

As
our commercial operations and sales volume grow
 we will need to continue to increase our workflow capacity for processing
 customer
service
 billing and general process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program
 among other things. We may
also need to purchase additional equipment and increase our manufacturing
 maintenance
 software and computing capacity to meet
increased demand. We cannot assure you that any of these increases in scale
 expansion of personnel
 purchase of equipment or
process enhancements will be successfully implemented.


    
    


The
loss of our Executive Chairman
 Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer or our inability to attract and retain highly
skilled officers and key personnel could negatively impact our business.

Our
success depends on the skills
 experience and performance of our Executive Chairman
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. The individual and collective efforts of these individuals will be important as we continue to develop and expand our
commercial activities. The loss or incapacity of existing members of our executive management team could negatively impact our
operations if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors. Qualified employees periodically are in great demand
and may be unavailable in the time frame required to satisfy our customers&rsquo; requirements. Expansion of our business could
require us to employ additional personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers
of skilled employees in the future. The loss of personnel or our inability to hire or retain sufficient personnel at competitive
rates could impair the growth of our business.

If
we were sued for product liability or professional liability
 we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.

The
marketing and sale of our products could lead to the filing of product liability claims alleging that our product made users ill.
A product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.

We
maintain product liability insurance
 but this insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against
product liability claims. Any product liability claim brought against us
 with or without merit
 could increase our insurance
rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally
 any product liability lawsuit could lead to
regulatory investigations
 product recalls or withdrawals
 damage our reputation or cause current vendors
 suppliers and customers
to terminate existing agreements and potential customers and partners to seek other suppliers
 any of which could negatively impact
our results of operations.

We
face risks associated with our international business.

Our
international business operations are subject to a variety of risks
 including:



    
    
difficulties
    with [managing] foreign and geographically dispersed operations; 

    
    
    

    
    
having
    to comply with various U.S. and international laws
 including export control laws and the FCPA
 and anti-money laundering
    laws; 

    
    
    

    
    
changes
    in uncertainties relating to foreign rules and regulations;

    
    
    

    
    
tariffs
    export or import restrictions
 restrictions on remittances abroad
 imposition of duties or taxes that limit our ability to
    import product; 

    
    
    

    
    
limitations
    on our ability to enter into cost-effective arrangements with distributors
 or at all;

    
    
    

    
    
fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates;

    
    
    

    
    
imposition
    of limitations on production
 sale or export in foreign countries;

    
    
    

    
    
imposition
    of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign processors or joint
    ventures;

    
    
    

    
    
imposition
    of differing labor laws and standards;



    
    




    
    
economic
    political or social instability in foreign countries and regions;

    
    
    

    
    
an
    inability
 or reduced ability
 to protect our intellectual property
 including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed
    by government action;

    
    
    

    
    
availability
    of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us;

    
    
    

    
    
difficulties
    in recruiting and retaining personnel
 and managing international operations; and

    
    
    

    
    
less
    developed infrastructure.


If
we expand into other target markets we cannot assure you that our expansion plans will be realized
 or if realized
 be successful.
We expect each market to have particular regulatory and funding hurdles to overcome and future developments in these markets
including the uncertainty relating to governmental policies and regulations
 could harm our business. If we expend significant
time and resources on expansion plans that fail or are delayed
 our reputation
 business and financial condition may be harmed.

Our
results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Currently
the majority of our international sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. We pay certain of our suppliers in a foreign
currency and we may pay others in the future in foreign currency. As a result
 an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative
to foreign currencies could require us to reduce our selling price or risk making our product less competitive in international
markets or our costs could increase. Also
 if our international sales increase
 we may enter into a greater number of transactions
denominated in non-U.S. dollars
 which could expose us to foreign currency risks
 including changes in currency exchange rates.

A
larger portion of our revenues may be denominated in other foreign currencies if we expand our international operations. Conducting
business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative
impact on our operating results. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies impact our revenues
cost of revenues and operating margins and result in foreign currency translation gains and losses.

We
could be negatively impacted by violations of applicable anti-corruption laws or violations of our internal policies designed
to ensure ethical business practices.

We
operate in a number of countries throughout the world
 including in countries that do not have as strong a commitment to anti-corruption
and ethical behavior that is required by U.S. laws or by corporate policies. We are subject to the risk that we
 our U.S. employees
or our employees located in other jurisdictions or any third parties that we engage to do work on our behalf in foreign countries
may take action determined to be in violation of anti-corruption laws in any jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Any violation
of anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in substantial fines
 sanctions
 civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment
of operations in certain jurisdictions and might harm our business
 financial condition or results of operations. Further
 detecting
investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior
management.

We
depend on our information technology systems
 and any failure of these systems could harm our business.

We
depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant elements of our operations. We have developed
propriety software for the management and operation of our business. We have installed and expect to expand a number of enterprise
software systems that affect a broad range of business processes and functional areas
 including for example
 systems handling
human resources
 financial controls and reporting
 contract management
 regulatory compliance and other infrastructure operations.


    
    


Information
technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources
 including telecommunications or
network failures
 malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover
 despite network security and back-up measures
 some of
our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins
 computer viruses and similar disruptive problems.
Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information technology
and telecommunications systems
 failures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunications systems or
those used by our third-party service providers could prevent us from providing support services and product to our customers
and managing the administrative aspects of our business. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications
systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could harm our business.

Our
operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural or other disasters
 power loss
 strikes and other events beyond
our control.

We
conduct a significant portion of our activities
 including administration and data processing
 at facilities located in Southern
Florida that have experienced major hurricanes and floods which could affect our facilities
 
 could significantly disrupt our
operations
 and delay or prevent product shipment during the time required to repair
 rebuild or replace damaged processing facilities;
these delays could be lengthy and costly. Our suppliers in Southeast Asia are also vulnerable to natural disasters which could
disrupt their operations and their ability to supply product to us. If any of our customers&rsquo; facilities are negatively impacted
by a disaster
 product shipments could be delayed. Additionally
 customers may delay purchases of products until operations return
to normal. Even if we and/or our suppliers are able to quickly respond to a disaster
 the ongoing effects of the disaster could
create some uncertainty in the operations of our business. In addition
 our facilities may be subject to a shortage of available
electrical power and other energy supplies. Any shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result
in blackouts
 which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business.

Risks
Related to Intellectual Property

Our
intellectual property rights are valuable
 and any inability to adequately protect
 or uncertainty regarding validity
 enforceability
or scope of them could undermine our competitive position and reduce the value of our products
 services and brand
 and litigation
to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly.

We
attempt to strengthen and differentiate our product portfolio by developing new and innovative products and product improvements.
As a result
 our patents
 trademarks
 trade secrets
 copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets to
us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services.
For example
 effective intellectual property protection may not be available in countries in which our products are sold. Also
although we have registered our trademark in various jurisdictions
 our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient
or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete
and hurt our results of operation. Also
 protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Policing unauthorized
use of our proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Litigation might be necessary to protect our intellectual property
rights and any such litigation may be costly and may divert our management&rsquo;s attention from our core business. An adverse
determination in any lawsuit involving our intellectual property is likely to jeopardize our business prospects and reputation.
Although we are not aware of any of such litigation
 we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs
 so we would be forced
to bear all litigation costs if we cannot recover them from other parties. All foregoing factors could harm our business
 financial
condition
 and results of operations. Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to
do business and harm our operating results.

We
may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties
 which
 if determined against us
 could adversely affect
our business and subject us to significant liability to third parties.

Our
success mainly depends on our ability to use and develop our technology and product designs without infringing upon the intellectual
property rights of third parties. We may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violations of other
intellectual property rights of third parties. Holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant
to our product offerings may be unknown to us
 which may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable
terms. There may also be technologies licensed to us and that we rely upon that are subject to infringement or other corresponding
allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies. In addition
 although we endeavor
to ensure that companies that work with us possess appropriate intellectual property rights or licenses
 we cannot fully avoid
the risks of intellectual property rights infringement created by suppliers of components used in our products or by companies
we work with in cooperative research and development activities. Our current or potential competitors may have obtained or may
obtain patents that will prevent
 limit or interfere with our ability to make
 use or sell our products. The defense of intellectual
property claims
 including patent infringement suits
 and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and
time consuming
 and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical personnel and management. These factors
could effectively prevent us from pursuing some or all of our business operations and result in our customers or potential customers
deferring
 canceling or limiting their purchase or use of our products
 which may have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition and results of operations.


    
    


Our
commercial success will depend in part on our success in obtaining and maintaining issued patents and other intellectual property
rights in the United States and elsewhere If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property
 competitors may be able to
use our processes and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have
 which could harm our business.

We
cannot provide any assurances that any of our patents have
 or that any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued
patents will include
 claims with a scope sufficient to protect our products
 any additional features we develop or any new products.
Patents
 if issued
 may be challenged
 deemed unenforceable
 invalidated or circumvented.

Furthermore
though an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable
 its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability
and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products.
Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective
technologies
 designs or methods. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our knowledge or trade secrets
by consultants
 suppliers
 vendors
 former employees and current employees. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect
our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States
 and we may encounter significant problems in protecting
our proprietary rights in these countries. If any of these developments were to occur
 they each could have a negative impact
on our sales.

If
we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets
 our business and competitive position could be harmed.

We
rely upon copyright and trade secret protection
 as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with
our employees
 consultants and third parties
 to protect our confidential and proprietary information. In addition to contractual
measures
 we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures.
Such measures may not
 for example
 in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized
access
 provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant
from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor
 and recourse we take against such misconduct may not
provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated
a trade secret can be difficult
 expensive and time-consuming
 and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition
 trade secrets may
be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary
information
 such as our trade secrets
 were to be disclosed or misappropriated
 or if any such information was independently
developed by a competitor
 our competitive position could be harmed.

We
may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.

The
laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign
jurisdictions. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement or the misappropriation of our intellectual property
rights. For example
 many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third
parties. In addition
 many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties
 including government agencies
or government contractors. In these countries
 patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be
sought on a country-by-country basis
 which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly
 we
may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries
 and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.


    
    


Proceedings
to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from
other aspects of our business. Accordingly
 our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.
In addition
 changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability
to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.

Third
parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated
trade secrets.

Although
we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work
for us
 we may be subject to claims that we or our employees
 consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise
used or disclosed intellectual property
 including trade secrets or other proprietary information
 of a former employer or other
third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims
 in addition
to paying monetary damages
 we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending
against such claims
 litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.

Risks
Related to Regulatory Matters

Our
products and operations are subject to government regulation and oversight both in the United States and abroad
 and our failure
to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business.

The
FDA and other government agencies regulate
 among other things
 with respect to our products and operations:



    
    
design
    development and manufacturing; 

    
    
    

    
    
testing
    labeling
 content and language of instructions for use and storage; 

    
    
    

    
    
product
    safety; 

    
    
    

    
    
marketing
    sales and distribution; 

    
    
    

    
    
record
    keeping procedures; 

    
    
    

    
    
advertising
    and promotion; 

    
    
    

    
    
recalls
    and corrective actions; 

    
    
    

    
    
product
    import and export. 


The
regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result
in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations
 higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.

The
failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions
such as:



    
    
warning
    letters; 

    
    
    

    
    
fines;
    

    
    
    

    
&#9679;
    
injunctions;
    



    
    




    
    
civil
    penalties; 

    
    
    

    
    
termination
    of distribution; 

    
    
    

    
    
recalls
    or seizures of products; 

    
    
    

    
    
delays
    in the introduction of products into the market; and

    
    
    

    
    
total
    or partial suspension of production.


We
may also be required to take corrective actions
 such as installing additional equipment or taking other actions
 each of which
could require us to make substantial capital expenditures. We could also be required to indemnify our employees in connection
with any expenses or liabilities that they may incur individually in connection with regulatory action against them. As a result
our future business prospects could deteriorate due to regulatory constraints
 and our profitability could be impaired by our
obligation to provide such indemnification to our employees.

Any
of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and harm our reputation
 business
financial condition and results of operations.

Product
liability claims could divert management&rsquo;s attention from our business
 be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage
awards against us that may not be covered by insurance.

Risks
Relating to Our Common Stock

We
may be unable to register for resale all of the Common Stock included within the Units sold in the Offering
 in which case a stockholder
will need to rely on an exemption from the registration requirements in order to sell such shares.

We
are obligated to file the &ldquo;resale&rdquo; Registration Statement with the SEC that covers all of our Conversion Shares and
Warrant Shares included within the Units sold in the Offering within 120 business days after the closing of the Merger. Nevertheless
it is possible that the SEC may not permit us to register all of such shares of Common Stock for resale. In certain circumstances
the SEC may take the view that the Offering requires us to register the issuance of the securities as a primary offering. Without
sufficient disclosure of this risk
 rescission of the Offering could be sought by investors or an offer of rescission may be mandated
by the SEC
 which would result in a material adverse effect to us. To date
 the SEC has not made any formal statements or proposed
or adopted any new rules or regulations regarding Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act
 as such rule applies to resale
registration statements. However
 investors should be aware of the risks that interpretive positions taken with respect to Rule
415
 or similar rules or regulations adopted subsequent to the date of this Report
 could have on the manner in which the Common
Stock may be registered or our ability to register the Common Stock for resale at all.

If
we are not able to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective
 then investors will need to rely on exemptions from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act
 such as Rule 144 which may require that the investor have held the shares
to be sold for a minimum period of time.

Failure
to cause a registration statement to become effective in a timely manner could materially adversely affect our company.

We
have agreed
 at our expense
 to prepare a registration statement covering the Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares in connection
with the Offering. Our obligation requires us to file the Registration Statement with the SEC within 120 business days of the
closing of the Merger. There are many reasons
 including those over which we have no control
 which could delay the filing or
effectiveness of the Registration Statement
 including delays resulting from the SEC review process and comments raised by the
SEC during that process. Failure to file or cause the Registration Statement to become effective in a timely manner or maintain
its effectiveness could materially adversely affect us.


    
    


As
a result of the Merger
 Keeler &amp; Co became subject to the reporting requirements of federal securities laws
 which can be
expensive.

As
a result of the Merger
 Keeler &amp; Co became a public reporting company and
 accordingly
 subject to the information and reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal and state securities laws
 including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports
 proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing
audited reports to stockholders will cause Keeler &amp; Co&rsquo;s expenses to be higher than they would have been if Keeler &amp;
Co remained privately-held and did not consummate the Merger.

If
we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls
 we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or
detect fraud. Consequently
 investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and this may decrease the trading price
of our Common Stock.

We
must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and detect fraud. We are in the process of evaluating
changes to internal controls for our new public company status but have not yet implemented changes. Failure to implement changes
to our internal controls or any other factors that we identify as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls
could harm our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our business
 operations or reported financial information.
Any such inability to establish effective controls or loss of confidence would have an adverse effect on our company and could
adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.

The
price of our Common Stock may be volatile and may be influenced by numerous factors
 some of which are beyond our control.

Factors
that could cause volatility in the market price of our Common Stock include
 but are not limited to:



    
    
actual
    or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results; 

    
    
    

    
    
actual
    or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; 

    
    
    

    
    
commercial
    success and market acceptance of our products; 

    
    
    

    
    
success
    of our competitors in commercializing products; 

    
    
    

    
    
strategic
    transactions undertaken by us; 

    
    
    

    
    
additions
    or departures of key personnel; 

    
    
    

    
    
product
    liability claims; 

    
    
    

    
    
prevailing
    economic conditions; 

    
    
    

    
    
disputes
    concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; 

    
    
    

    
    
U.S.
    or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry; 

    
    
    

    
    
sales
    of our Common Stock by our officers
 directors or significant stockholders; 

    
    
    

    
    
future
    sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us; 

    
    
    

    
    
business
    disruptions caused by natural disasters; and 

    
    
    

    
    
issuance
    of new or changed securities analysts&rsquo; reports or recommendations regarding us. 



    
    


In
addition
 the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that have been often unrelated to the operating performance
of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our Common Stock. In the past
when the price of a stock has been volatile
 holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation
against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us
 we could incur substantial costs defending
the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging
growth companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company
&rdquo; as defined in the JOBS Act
 and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various
reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &ldquo;emerging growth companies
&rdquo; including
not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements
of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not
previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.
If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active trading market for our Common
Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

In
addition
 Section 102 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended
 or the Securities Act
 for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. An &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; can therefore delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the
benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that
comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

You
may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock or
preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock or preferred stock.

If
our existing stockholders convert our Series A Stock or exercise Warrants or sell
 or indicate an intention to sell
 substantial
amounts of our Common Stock in the public market after the lock-up Restricted Period lapses
 the price of our Common Stock could
decline. The perception in the market that these sales may occur could also cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.

In
the future
 we may issue authorized but previously unissued equity securities
 resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests
of the then current stockholders. We are authorized to issue an aggregate of 100
000
000 shares of common stock and 5
000
000
shares of &ldquo;blank check&rdquo; preferred stock. We may issue additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities that
are convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees
 future acquisitions
future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes
 or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional
shares of our Common Stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. We may need to raise additional
capital in the near future to meet our working capital needs
 and there can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue
additional shares
 warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with these capital raising efforts
 including
at a price (or exercise prices) below the price you paid for your stock.

There
is currently no market for our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that any market will ever develop. You may therefore
be unable to re-sell shares of our Common Stock at times and prices that you believe are appropriate.

Our
Common Stock is not listed on a national securities exchange
 or any other exchange
 or quoted on an over-the-counter market.
Therefore
 there is no trading market
 active or otherwise
 for our Common Stock and our Common Stock may never be included for
trading on any stock exchange
 automated quotation system or any over-the-counter market. Accordingly
 our Common Stock is highly
illiquid
 and you will likely experience difficulty in re-selling such shares at times and prices that you may desire


    
    


Our
Common Stock may be deemed a &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; which may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.

Rule
15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a &ldquo;penny stock
&rdquo; for the purposes relevant to us
 as any
equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject
to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
 the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer
approve a person&rsquo;s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written
agreement to the transaction
 setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.

In
order to approve a person&rsquo;s account for transactions in penny stocks
 the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information
and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks
are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating
the risks of transactions in penny stocks.

The
broker or dealer must also deliver
 prior to any transaction in a penny stock
 a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating
to the penny stock market
 which
 in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability
determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed
 written agreement from the investor prior to the
transaction. Generally
 brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo;
rules. If our Common Stock is or becomes subject to the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules
 it may be more difficult for investors
to dispose of our Common Stock and cause a decline in the market value of our Common Stock.

Disclosure
also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about commissions
payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative
 current quotations for the securities and the rights and
remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally
 monthly statements have to be sent disclosing
recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks

The
sales practice requirements of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) may limit a stockholder&rsquo;s
ability to buy and sell our Common Stock.

FINRA
has adopted rules requiring that
 in recommending an investment to a customer
 a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for
believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their
non-institutional customers
 broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&rsquo;s financial
status
 tax status
 investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules
 FINRA has indicated its
belief that there is a high probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers.
If these FINRA requirements are applicable to us or our securities
 they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend
that at least some of their customers buy our Common Stock
 which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our
Common Stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our Common Stock.

Our
operating results for a particular period may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities
analysts
 each of which may cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate or decline.

We
expect our operating results to be subject to fluctuations. Our operating results will be affected by numerous factors
 including:



    
    
variations
    in the level of expenses related to future development plans; 

    
    
    

    
    
fluctuations
    in value of the underlying commodity;

    
    
    

    
    
inability
    to procure sufficient quantities to meet demand due to the scarcity of the product available from its suppliers



    
    




    
    
level
    of underlying demand for our products and any other products we sell; 

    
    
    

    
    
any
    intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition
 interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved;
    and 

    
    
    

    
    
regulatory
    developments affecting us or our competitors. 


If
our operating results for a particular period fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts
 the price of our
Common Stock could decline substantially. Furthermore
 any fluctuations in our operating results may
 in turn
 cause the price
of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that comparisons of our financial results from various reporting periods
are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance

Our
principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our Common Stock and will be able to exercise significant
influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.

As
of the date of this filing
 our executive officers
 directors and principal stockholders
 together with their respective affiliates
owned approximately 94.7% of our Common Stock
 including shares subject to outstanding options that are exercisable within 60
days after such date. Accordingly
 these stockholders will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management
and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval
 including the election of our board of directors and approval of
significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of entrenching our management and/or
the board of directors
 delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting
to obtain control of us
 which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the fair market value of our Common Stock.

Because
we became a reporting company under the Exchange Act by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering
 we
may not be able to attract the attention of research analysts at major brokerage firms.

Because
we did not become a reporting company by conducting an underwritten initial public offering of our Common Stock
 and because we
will not be listed on a national securities exchange
 securities analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our company.
In addition
 investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite secondary offerings on our behalf than they might if we
became a public reporting company by means of an underwritten initial public offering
 because they may be less familiar with
our company as a result of more limited coverage by analysts and the media
 and because we became public at an early stage in
our development. The failure to receive research coverage or support in the market for our shares will have an adverse effect
on our ability to develop a liquid market for our Common Stock.

Because
the Merger was a reverse merger
 the Registration Statement we file with respect to the shares of Common Stock received by investors
in the Merger might be subject to heightened scrutiny by the SEC.

Additional
risks may exist as a result of our becoming a public reporting company through a &ldquo;reverse merger.&rdquo; Certain SEC rules
are more restrictive when applied to reverse merger companies
 such as the ability of stockholders to re-sell their shares of
Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144
 and the SEC may subject the Registration Statement we file with respect to the shares of Common
Stock received by investors in the Merger and the Offering to heightened scrutiny.

The
resale of shares covered by the Registration Statement could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock in the public
market
 should one develop
 which result would in turn negatively affect our ability to raise additional equity capital.

The
sale
 or availability for sale
 of our Common Stock in the public market may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our
Common Stock and may impair our ability to raise additional capital by selling equity or equity-linked securities. We have agreed
at our expense
 to prepare and file the Registration Statement with the SEC registering the resale of an aggregate of 17
074
750
shares of Common Stock issued and/or issuable in connection with the Merger
 the Offering
 the Company Settlement and the shares
retained by the pre-Merger shareholders. Once effective
 the Registration Statement will permit the resale of these shares at
any time. The resale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the market
price for our Common Stock and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Common Stock at times and prices that you
feel are appropriate. Furthermore
 we expect that
 because there will be a large number of shares registered pursuant to the Registration
Statement
 selling stockholders will continue to offer shares covered by such Registration Statement for a significant period
of time
 the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly
 the adverse market and price pressures resulting from
an offering pursuant to the Registration Statement may continue for an extended period of time and continued negative pressure
on the market price of our Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional equity capital.


    
    


Issuance
of stock to fund our operations may dilute your investment and reduce your equity interest.

We
may need to raise capital in the future to fund the development of our seafood business. Any equity financing may have significant
dilutive effect to stockholders and a material decrease in our stockholders&rsquo; equity interest in us. Equity financing
 if
obtained
 could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. At its sole discretion
 our board of directors may
issue additional securities without seeking stockholder approval
 and we do not know when we will need additional capital or
if we do
 whether it will be available to us.

Provisions
of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company
 even if such an acquisition would
be beneficial to our stockholders
 which could make it more difficult for you to change management.

Provisions
in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage
 delay or prevent a merger
 acquisition or other change in control
that stockholders may consider favorable
 including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their
shares. In addition
 these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current
management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:



    
    
no
    cumulative voting in the election of directors; 

    
    
    

    
    
the
    exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors
    or the resignation
 death or removal of a director; 

    
    
    

    
    
a
    requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors; 

    
    
    

    
    
a
    notice provision requirement for stockholders to nominate directors;

    
    
    

    
    
a
    requirement that our directors may be removed only by a supermajority (two-thirds) vote of the stockholders; and 

    
    
    

    
    
the
    authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine. 


In
addition
 Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested
stockholder
 generally a person who
 together with its affiliates
 owns
 or within the last three years has owned
 15% or more
of our voting stock
 for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder
unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly
 Delaware law may discourage
 delay or prevent
a change in control of the company. Furthermore
 our certificate of incorporation will specify that the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders.
We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly
experienced in resolving corporate disputes
 efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other
forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However
 the provision may have the effect of discouraging
lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies&rsquo;
certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings
 and it is possible that
 in connection with any applicable
action brought against us
 a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation to
be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.


    
    


We
do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future; therefore
 capital appreciation
 if
any
 of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.

We
have never declared or paid cash dividends on our Common Stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock
in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and
growth of our business. In addition
 our current loan and security agreement with ACF contains
 and our future loan arrangements
if any
 may contain
 terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our Common Stock. As
a result
 capital appreciation
 if any
 of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.

We
may apply the proceeds of the Offering to uses that ultimately do not improve our operating results or increase the value of our
Common Stock.

We
intend to use the net proceeds from the Offering
 including proceeds received upon the exercise of any Warrants sold therein
for general working capital purposes. However
 we do not have more specific plans for the net proceeds from the Offering and our
management has broad discretion in how we use these proceeds. These proceeds could be applied in ways that do not improve our
operating results or otherwise increase the value of our Common Stock.

Recent
Developments

We
were incorporated on October 17
 2017 in the State of Delaware as a blank check company to be used as a vehicle to pursue a business
combination with an unidentified target. Since inception
 and prior to the Merger
 we only engaged in organizational efforts.

On
November 8
 2018
 we consummated the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement by and among the Company
 Acquisition
Sub
 Keeler &amp; Co and the Blue Star Stockholder. As a result of the Merger
 effective as of November 8
 2018
 Acquisition Sub
merged with and into Keeler &amp; Co
 and Keeler &amp; Co became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

In
connection with the Merger
 the Company changed its name from &ldquo;AG Acquisition Group II
 Inc.&rdquo; to &ldquo;Blue Star
Foods Corp.&rdquo; and succeeded to the business of Keeler &amp; Co.

As
a result of the Merger and the related change in our business and operations
 a discussion of our past financial results is not
pertinent
 and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of Keeler &amp; Co
 the accounting acquirer
prior to the Merger are considered the historical financial results of the Company.

The
audited financial statements for our fiscal years ended December 31
 2018 and the audited financial statements as amended filed
with the Securities Exchange Commission with the Company&rsquo;s Form 8-K/A on December 31
 2108
 include a summary of our significant
accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management
 all material adjustments
necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements.
All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

Results
of Operations

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon
 and should be
read in conjunction with
 the audited financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Year
Ended December 31
 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31
 2017

Net
Sales. 
 2018 decreased 13.0% to $32
165
933 as compared to $36
951
923 for
the twelve months ended December 31
 2017. The revenue decrease reflects a decrease in poundage sold attributable to a reduction
in sales of Hanaii product from China. The Company elected not to purchase from China during the late summer into winter production
season due to the uncertainty surrounding the trade tariffs being imposed on the product. The Company believed that these tariffs
would remove any pricing advantage of the Hanaii product from China and would require the Company to sell at little to no margin
on these products in order to be at a price point that would entice the customers to purchase Chinese Hanaii. Additionally
 overall
pricing pressures continued to soften industry demand as prices increased during 2018 to new market highs. We believe
 these high
prices caused customers to either downgrade their purchases to less expensive specifications
 or remove crab from their menus
altogether.


    
    


Cost
of Goods Sold.
 2018 decreased to $27
227
664 as compared to $31
254
430
for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017. The decrease is attributable to the revenue decline.

Gross
Profit Margin
 2018 decreased $759
224 to $4
938
269 from $5
697
493
for the twelve months ended December 31
2017. This decrease is directly attributable to the decreased revenue.

Gross
profit margin
 2018 remained consistent at 15.4% with the gross profit margin for
the twelve months ended December 31
 2017.

Commissions
Expenses. 
574 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017 to $133
240 for the twelve-month
period ended December 31
 2018. The decrease can be attributed to lower commissionable revenues.


Salaries &amp; Wages
Expense
971
 to $2
594
677 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018
as compared to $1
859
706 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017. The increase can be directly attributed to stock-based
compensation related to the issuance of options to two officers during 2018. The expense related to the options in 2018 was $808
338.
Cash payment for salaries and wages decreased by $73
367 for the 12 months ending December 31
 2018
 as a result of the re-alignment
of our sales staff during 2018
 reducing net sales salaries but leaving headcount the same during the year.

Settlement
&amp; Warrant Expenses 
353 for the 12 months ending December 31
 2018 as compared
to $0 for the same period in 2017. Settlement expense of $688
000 for 2018 relates directly to Series A Stock issued to the Settlement
Parties. The Warrant expense of $81
353 for 2018 relates to the non-cash cost for the issuance of Warrants to the Settlement Parties
and the investors in the Offering.

Other
Operating Expense. 
846 from $2
340
163 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017
to $2
709
009 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to costs associated with the
closing of the Merger. These costs include $530
000 paid to service providers in shares of common stock and $94
995 paid in cash.
The balance of the increase relates to an increase in quality assurance expenses and insurance costs. Included in other operating
expense for the 12 months ending December 31
 2018 was a settlement with a supplier for $388
199 pursuant to which such supplier
agreed to reduce the amount the Company under a settlement and mutual release agreement entered into in October 2018.

Interest
Expense. 
416 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017 to $1
009
106 for the twelve
months ended December 31
 2018. This increase is due to an increase in interest paid to a stockholder of $12
300 for a full years&rsquo;
interest on an additional $500
000 that was loaned to the Company in May 2017. $25
700 represents interest paid to ACF as a result
of the increase in the 30-day LIBOR rate during 2018. Despite the fact that the average monthly loan balance decreased in 2018
the interest rate paid to ACF increased from 6.73% at December 31
 2017 to 8.96% at December 31
 2018.

Other
Income/Expenses. 
478 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017 to $0 for the twelve
months ended December 31
 2018. The decrease is attributable to no charges related to bank forbearance for the 12 months ending
December 31
 2018.

Net
Income/(Loss). 
277
116 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2018 as compared to
a net profit of $343
156 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017. The decrease can be attributed to the decrease in revenue
combined with increased operating expenses associated with the completion of the Merger during the twelve months ending December
31
 2018.


    
    


Cash
(Used in) Provided by Operating Activities. 
31
 2018 was $3
641
738 as compared to cash used in operating activities of $3
075
944 for the twelve months ended December 31
2017. The increase is attributable to cash generated from inventory of $5
220
684 during the twelve months ended December 31
2018 as compared to cash used for inventory of $3
429
637 during the twelve months ended December 31
 2017. Additionally
 for
the twelve months ended December 31
 2018 cash provided by Accounts receivable was $884
240 as compared to the cash provided by
Accounts receivable of ($257
934) for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017. The Company used $1
139
619 to advance an affiliated
supplier as compared to $981
972 provided for the 12 months ending December 31
 2017.

Cash
Used in Investing Activities. 
 2018 was $26
681
as compared to $33
491 cash used for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017.

Cash
Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. 
 2018
was $3
288
084 as compared to cash provided in financing activities of $2
863
645 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2017.
The primary usage of cash was a reduction in the outstanding line of credit of $3
905
425 as of December 31
 2018 as compared
to an increase of $2
511
735 as of December 31
 2017. The Company also received $725
000 in proceeds from the sale of Series A
Stock for the twelve months ending December 31
 2018 as compared to $0 in the prior year.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

The
Company had cash of $13
143 as of December 31
 2018. At December 31
 2018
 the Company had a working capital deficit of $1
146
937
including $2
910
136 in stockholder loans that are subordinated to ACF as compared to a working capital deficit of $1
676
219
at December 31
 2017
 also including $2
910
136 in stockholder debt. The Company&rsquo;s primary sources of liquidity consisted
of inventory of $8
126
634 and accounts receivable of $3
449
487 at December 31
 2018. The increase in working capital was due
primarily to the reduction of inventories of $4
826
216 and accounts receivable of $1
226
101
 as opposed to the reduction in
accounts payable and the working capital line of credit of $5
158
916. The Company also received proceeds of $725
000 for the
sale of Series A Stock in the twelve months ending December 31
 2018.

The
Company has historically financed its operations through the cash flow generated from operations
 loans from John Keeler
 a working
capital line of credit and the sale of equity in private offerings.

Loan
and Security Agreement

On
August 31
 2016
 the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement and a revolving credit note for a $14
000
000 revolving
line of credit with ACF
 the proceeds of which were used to pay off the prior line of credit
 pay new loan costs of approximately
$309
000
 and provide additional working capital. The credit facility was amended on November 18
 2016
 September 19
 2017
 October
16
 2017
 September 19
 2018 and November 8
 2018. In the fourth amendment the term of this facility was extended to 2021 and
is subject to early termination by the lender upon defined events of default. The Company continues to be obligated to meet certain
financial covenants.

The
line of credit bears an interest at the greater of (i) the 3-month LIBOR rate plus 6.25%
 (ii) the prime rate plus 3.0% and (iii)
6.5%. Borrowing is based on up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory
at the same rate
 subject to certain specified limitations. The credit line is collateralized by substantially all the assets
of the Company and is personally guaranteed by John Keeler
 our Executive Chairman. The Company is restricted with respect to
certain distribution payments
 use of funds and is required to comply with certain other covenants including certain financial
ratios.

During
the twelve months ending December 31
2018
 the Company failed to meet certain financial covenants. Such default was waived in
September 2018 pursuant to the fourth amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement and no default interest was incurred. The Company
is currently in compliance with all covenants and the line of credit currently bears interest at the rate of 8.957%. At December
31 31
 2018
 the outstanding balance of the line of credit was $8
203
725.


    
    


John
Keeler Promissory Notes

From
January 2006 through May 2017
 Keeler &amp; Co issued an aggregate of approximately $2
910
000 6% demand promissory notes to John
Keeler
 our Executive Chairman. As of December 31
 2018
 approximately $2
910
000 of principal was outstanding and $174
600 of
interest was paid under the notes. These notes have been subordinated to the provider of the working capital line of credit and
payment of these loans are restricted under this subordination agreement. After satisfaction of the terms of the subordination
the Company can prepay the notes at any time first against interest due thereunder. If an event of default occurs under the notes
interest will accrue at 18% per annum and if not paid within 10 days of payment becoming due
 the holder of the note is entitled
to a late fee of 5% of the amount of payment not timely made.

Kenar
Note

On
March 26
 2019
 the Company issued a four-month promissory note in the principal amount of $1
000
000 (the &ldquo;Kenar Note&rdquo;)
to Kenar Overseas Corp.
 a company registered in Panama (the &ldquo;Lender&rdquo;). The term of the note may be extended for an
additional two months at the Lender&rsquo;s discretion. The note bears interest at the rate of 18% per annum during the initial
four months which rate will increase to 24% during any extension thereof. The note may be prepaid in whole or in part without
penalty. John Keeler
 the Company&rsquo;s Executive Chairman pledged 5
000
000 shares of common stock to secure the Company&rsquo;s
obligations under the note.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Variable
Interest Entity

Under
Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standard Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 810
 
when a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (&ldquo;VIE&rdquo;)
 as defined
in ASC 810
 the VIE must be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner
is the primary beneficiary of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights
 obligations
and economic interests of each interest holder in the VIE.

The
Company evaluates its interests in VIE&rsquo;s on an ongoing basis and consolidates any VIE in which it has a controlling financial
interest and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest has both of the following characteristics:
(i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (ii) the obligation
to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to it or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could
be significant to the VIE.

Effective
April 1
 2014
 the Company&rsquo;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. (&ldquo;Strike&rdquo;)
a related party entity which holds the Company&rsquo;s inventory on consignment in United Kingdom (see Note 3). The Company evaluated
its interest in Strike and determined that Strike is a VIE due to the Company&rsquo;s implicit interest in Strike and the fact
that Strike and the Company were under common control after the transfer of the controlling interest. Moreover
 the Company determined
that it is the primary beneficiary of Strike due to the fact that the Company had both the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact Strike and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Strike. Therefore
the Company consolidated Strike in its financial statements.

Strike&rsquo;s
activities are reflected in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements starting on April 1
 2014
 the effective date of the controlling
interest transfer. Strike&rsquo;s equity is classified as non-controlling interest in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements
since the Company is not a shareholder of Strike. Strike was not a VIE of the Company and the Company was not the primary beneficiary
of Strike prior to the controlling interest transfer.

The
Company also evaluated its interest in three related party entities that are under common control with the Company
 Bacolod
 Bicol
Blue Star Export Co. (&ldquo;Bicol&rdquo;) and John Keeler Real Estate Holding (&ldquo;JK Real Estate&rdquo;)
 in light of ASC
810. The Company purchased inventory from Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company purchased
inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate
 a landlord that
is a related party through common family beneficial ownership.


    
    


The
Company determined that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&rsquo;s as they do not meet the criteria to be considered a VIE per ASC
810. The Company does not directly or indirectly absorb any variability of Bacolod or Bicol. The relationship between the Company
and Bacolod and Bicol is strictly a supplier/customer relationship. Moreover
 Bacolod and Bicol have other customers besides the
Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&rsquo;s customer
 they would be able to sustain their operations from
selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company concluded that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&rsquo;s and the
Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary
 Bacolod or Bicol is not consolidated with the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.

The
Company determined that JK Real Estate is a VIE due the fact that the Company guarantees the mortgage on the facility rented from
JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK Real Estate&rsquo;s equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance
its activities without subordinated financial support. Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted
on behalf of the Company&rsquo;s stockholder. The Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate since
the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK Real
Estate is not consolidated with the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.



Substantially
all of the Company&rsquo;s inventory consists of packaged crab meat located at the Company&rsquo;s warehouse facility as well
as public cold storage facilities and merchandise in transit from suppliers. The cost of inventory is primarily determined using
the specific identification method. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method.

Merchandise
is purchased cost and freight shipping point and becomes the Company&rsquo;s asset and liability upon leaving the suppliers&rsquo;
warehouse. The Company had in-transit inventory of approximately $4
203
400 and $6
148
000 as of December 31
 2018 and December
31
 2017
 respectively.

The
Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and records an allowance to reduce the carrying value of inventory
to the lower of cost or market based on its assessment of market conditions
 inventory turnover and current stock levels. Inventory
write-downs are charged to cost of goods sold. The Company recorded an inventory allowance of approximately $39
300 for the years
ended December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 which represents a reduction of approximately $88
600 from the year ending December
31
 2016.

Advances
to Suppliers and Related Party

In
the normal course of business
 the Company may advance payments to its suppliers
 including Bacolod
 a related party. These advances
are in the form of prepayments for products that will ship within a short window of time. In the event that it becomes necessary
for the Company to return products or adjust for quality issues
 the Company is issued a credit by the vendor in the normal course
of business and these credits are also reflected against future shipments.

As
of December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 the balance due from Bacolod for future shipments was approximately $1
139
619 and
$0
 respectively. The 2018 balances represent approximately three to four months of purchases from the supplier.

Revenue
Recognition

Effective
with the January 1
 2018 adoption of ASU 2014-09
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&rdquo; and the associated
ASUs (collectively
 &ldquo;Topic 606&rdquo;)
 the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods
or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
To determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company
performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the
contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.


    
    


The
Company elected an accounting policy to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities. Consideration payable
to a customer is recorded as a reduction of the arrangement&rsquo;s transaction price
 thereby reducing the amount of revenue
recognized
 unless the payment is for distinct goods or services received from the customer.

In
periods prior to the adoption of Topic 606
 the Company&rsquo;s accounting policy was to recognize revenue when the products were
shipped
 the risks of ownership transferred to the customer and collectability was reasonably assured. Revenue was stated net
of sales returns and allowances. The incentives for sales discounts and promotions the Company offers to its customers were accounted
for as a reduction of revenue when they were characterized as cash consideration
 in accordance with ASC 605
 Revenue Recognition.
Otherwise
 the incentives were expensed.

Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In
May 2014
 FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&rdquo;
 and has subsequently issued several supplemental
and/or clarifying ASUs (collectively
 &ldquo;ASC 606&rdquo;). ASC 606 prescribes a single common revenue standard that replaces
most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 is intended to provide a more consistent interpretation and application
of the principles outlined in the standard across filers in multiple industries and within the same industries compared to current
practices
 which should improve comparability. Adoption of ASC 606 is required for annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15
 2017. Upon adoption
 we must elect to adopt either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or use
the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized at the date of initial
application. We adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective method on January 1
 2018.

Under
ASC 606
 an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services
 in an amount that reflects
the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition
for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606
 the entity performs the following five steps: (i)
identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction
price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or
as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASC 606 also impacts certain other areas
 such as the accounting for costs
to obtain or fulfill a contract. The standard also requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

We
examined our revenue recognition policy specific to all revenue streams governing product sales and have come to conclusions on
the impact of the new standard using the 5-step process prescribed by ASC 606. We reviewed all of our contracts
 and determined
the potential impact to our accounting policies
 financial controls and operations. Our conclusions include recognizing revenue
on product sales once the product is sold to the distributor or retail customers.

As
noted above
 we used the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard. This means that we did not restate previously
issued financial statements
 but we recorded a one-time adjustment to retained earnings of ($81
520). This adjustment represents
the sales of our product to our customers prior to January 1
 2018
 that had not been delivered or in control of the customer.

The
cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated January 1
 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of ASC 606 was as follows:

Previously
we recognized revenue on product sales once the product left the company&rsquo;s warehouse. Effective January 1
 2018
 we began
recognizing revenue when our customers
 take control of our product be it a shipment or upon delivery. This will have the impact
of us recognizing revenue approximately seven calendar days later than before adopting the new standard. The following financial
statement line items for twelve months ended December 31
 2018 were affected as a result of the adoption:

ASC
606 did not have an aggregate impact on our net cash provided by operating activities but resulted in offsetting changes in certain
assets and liabilities presented within net cash used in operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows
 as
reflected in the above tables.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance ASU No. 2016-02
 &ldquo;Leases&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2016-02&rdquo;)
as amended by ASU 2018-10
 &ldquo;Codification Improvements to Topic 842
 Leases&rdquo; and ASU 2018-11
 &ldquo;Leases (Topic
842): Targeted Improvements.&rdquo; Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required to recognize a
lease liability
 which is a lessee&rsquo;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis;
and a right-of-use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&rsquo;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified
asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is
largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December
15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance.

ASC
842 was previously required to be adopted using the modified retrospective approach. However
 in July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU
2018-11
 which allows for retrospective application with the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Under this option
 entities would not need to apply ASC 842 (along with its disclosure
requirements) to the comparative prior periods presented.

Management
expects that most of its operating leases (primarily warehouse space) will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right
of use assets on its consolidated balance sheet. The Company has elected to adopt certain of the optional practical expedients
including the package of practical expedients
 which
 among other things
 gives the option to not reassess: (1) whether expired
or existing contracts are or contain leases; (2) the lease classification for expired or existing leases; and (3) initial direct
costs for existing leases.

currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Blue
Stars Foods Corp.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Blue Stars Foods Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively
 the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
 changes
in stockholders&rsquo; deficit
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
&ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial
position of the Company as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Going
Concern Matter

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note three to the financial statements
 the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency
that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note three. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note
    1. 
Company
                                         Overview 
        
Located
        in Miami
 Florida
 Blue Star Foods Corp. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a sustainable seafood company. The company&rsquo;s
        main operating business
 John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. has been in business for approximately twenty-one years. The Company
        was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware. The current source of revenue is importing blue and red swimming crab
        meat primarily from Indonesia
 Philippines and China and distributing it in the United States of America
 Canada and Europe
        under several brand names such as Blue Star
 Oceanica
 Pacifika and Harbor Banks.
        
On
        November 8
 2018 the sole shareholder of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization
        with Blue Star Foods Corp. (Formerly A.G. Acquisition Group II
 Inc.) and Blue Star Acquisition Corp. John R. Keeler exchanged
        his 500 shares with a par value of $1.00 in John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. for the 15
000
000 shares with a par value of
        $.0001 of the then outstanding 16
015
000 outstanding shares. As part of the merger
 the net liabilities existing in the
        company as of the date of the merger totaling approximately $2
400 were converted to equity as part of this transaction.
        The prior owners of Blue Star Foods Corp. received 750
000 shares of common stock as part of this transaction
 and various
        service providers received 265
000 shares as compensation for their work on the transaction resulting in and expense and
        additional paid in capital of $530
001. Additionally
 there were 725 Series A Preferred shares and 181
250 warrants issued
        to private placement investors for total capital contribution of $725
000
 688 Series A Preferred shares and 172
000 warrants
        issued for settlement with prior investors which had a fair value of $688
000 and $81
353 respectively. Lastly
 upon the
        close of the merger there were 3
120
000 options to purchase common stock issued to Christopher Constable. Additionally
        Carlos Faria held options to purchase 104 shares of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. prior to the merger. These options were
        immediately converted at closing to 3
120
000 options to purchase common stock in Blue Star Foods Corp.
        
The
        Merger was accounted for as a &ldquo;reverse merger&rdquo; and recapitalization since
 immediately following the completion
        of the transaction
 the holders of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.&rsquo;s stock will have effective control of Blue Star
        Foods Corp. In addition
 John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. will have control of the combined entity through control of the Board
        by designating all four of the board seats. Additionally
 all of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.&rsquo;s officers and senior
        executive positions will continue on as management of the combined entity after consummation of the Merger. For accounting
        purposes
 John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc. will be deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and
 consequently
        the transaction has been treated as a recapitalization of Blue Star Foods Corp. Accordingly
 John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.&rsquo;s
        assets
 liabilities and results of operations are the historical financial statements of the registrant
 and the John
        Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc.&rsquo;s assets
 liabilities and results of operations have been consolidated with Blue Star Foods
        Corp effective as of the date of the closing of the Merger. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded
        in this transaction.
        



    
    




Note
                                         2. 
        
Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies 


Basis
of Presentation:

The
accompanying financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;).

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
 John Keeler &amp; Co
 a wholly owned subsidiary
 and its
variable interest entity for which the John Keeler &amp; Co. the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

Variable
Interest Entity

Under
Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standard Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 810
 
when a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (&ldquo;VIE&rdquo;)
 as defined
in ASC 810
 the VIE must be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner
is the primary beneficiary of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights
 obligations
and economic interests of each interest holder in the VIE.

The
Company evaluates its interests in VIE&rsquo;s on an ongoing basis and consolidates any VIE in which it has a controlling financial
interest and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest has both of the following characteristics:
(i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (ii) the obligation
to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to it or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could
be significant to the VIE.

Effective
April 1
 2014
 the Company&rsquo;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. (&ldquo;Strike&rdquo;)
a related party entity which holds the Company&rsquo;s inventory on consignment in United Kingdom (see Note 3). The Company evaluated
its interest in Strike and determined that Strike is a VIE due to the Company&rsquo;s implicit interest in Strike and the fact
that Strike and the Company were under common control after the transfer of the controlling interest. Moreover
 the Company determined
that it is the primary beneficiary of Strike due to the fact that the Company had both the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact Strike and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Strike. Therefore
the Company consolidated Strike in its financial statements.


    
    


Strike&rsquo;s
activities are reflected in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements starting on April 1
 2014
 the effective date of the controlling
interest transfer. Strike&rsquo;s equity is classified as non-controlling interest in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements
since the Company is not a shareholder of Strike. Strike was not a VIE of the Company and the Company was not the primary beneficiary
of Strike prior to the controlling interest transfer.

The
Company also evaluated its interest in three related party entities that are under common control with the Company
 Bacolod Blue
Star Export Corp. (&ldquo;Bacolod&rdquo;)
 Bicol Blue Star Export Co. (&ldquo;Bicol&rdquo;) and John Keeler Real Estate Holding
(&ldquo;JK Real Estate&rdquo;)
 in light of ASC 810. The Company purchased inventory from Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized
crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company purchased inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and
warehouse facility from JK Real Estate
 a landlord that is a related party through common family beneficial ownership (see Note
7).

The
Company determined that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&rsquo;s as they do not meet the criteria to be considered a VIE per ASC
810. The Company does not directly or indirectly absorb any variability of Bacolod or Bicol. The relationship between the Company
 accounting
policy). Moreover
 Bacolod and Bicol have other customers besides the Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&rsquo;s
customer
 they would be able to sustain their operations from selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company
concluded that Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&rsquo;s and the Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary
 Bacolod or Bicol
is not consolidated with the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.

The
Company determined that JK Real Estate is a VIE due the fact that the Company guarantees the mortgage on the facility rented from
JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK Real Estate&rsquo;s equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance
its activities without subordinated financial support. Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted
on behalf of the Company&rsquo;s stockholder. The Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate since
the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK Real
Estate is not consolidated with the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.

Cash
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

On
January 1
 2018 the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18
 &ldquo;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash&rdquo;

 
total of cash and cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash.


    
    


The
Company maintains cash balances with financial institutions in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Company (&ldquo;FDIC&rdquo;)
insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts and believes it does not have a significant exposure.

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

The
Company considers any cash balance in the lender designated cash collateral account as restricted cash. All cash proceeds must
be deposited into cash collateral account
 and will be cleared and applied to the line of credit. The Company has no access to
this account
 and the purpose of the funds is restricted to repayment of the line of credit. As of December 31
 2018 and 2017
restricted cash was approximately $334
500 and $29
500.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable consist of unsecured obligations due from customers under normal trade terms
 usually net 30 days. The Company grants
credit to its customers based on the Company&rsquo;s evaluation of a particular customer&rsquo;s credit worthiness.

Allowances
for doubtful accounts are maintained for potential credit losses based on the age of the accounts receivable and the results of
the Company&rsquo;s periodic credit evaluations of its customers&rsquo; financial condition. Receivables are written off as uncollectible
and deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts after collection efforts have been deemed to be unsuccessful. Subsequent
recoveries are netted against the provision for doubtful accounts expense. The Company generally does not charge interest on receivables.

Receivables
are net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and sales return and allowances. They are stated at estimated net realizable
value. As of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company recorded sales return and allowances and refund liability of approximately
$159
500 and $155
000
 respectively. There was no allowance for bad debt recorded during the years ended December 31
 2018 and
2017.



Substantially
all of the Company&rsquo;s inventory consists of packaged crab meat located at the Company&rsquo;s warehouse facility as well
as public cold storage facilities and merchandise in transit from suppliers. The cost of inventory is primarily determined using
the specific identification method. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method.

Merchandise
is purchased cost and freight shipping point and becomes the Company&rsquo;s asset and liability upon leaving the suppliers&rsquo;
warehouse. The Company had in-transit inventory of approximately $4
203
400 and $6
148
000 as of December 31
 2018 and December
31
 2017
 respectively.


    
    


The
Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and records an allowance to reduce the carrying value of inventory
to the lower of cost or market based on its assessment of market conditions
 inventory turnover and current stock levels. Inventory
write-downs are charged to cost of goods sold. The Company recorded an inventory allowance of approximately $39
300 for the years
ended December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 this represents a reduction of approximately $88
600 from the year ending December
31
 2016.

Advances
to Suppliers and Related Party

In
the normal course of business
 the Company may advance payments to its suppliers
 inclusive of Bacolod
 a related party. These
advances are in the form of prepayments for products that will ship within a short window of time. In the event that it becomes
necessary for the Company to return products or adjust for quality issues
 the Company is issued a credit by the vendor in the
normal course of business and these credits are also reflected against future shipments.

As
of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the balance due from the related party for future shipments was approximately $1
139
619 and $0
respectively. The 2018 balances represent approximately three to four months of purchases from the supplier.

Fixed
Assets

Fixed
assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are being depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the asset as follows:



Furniture
    and fixtures
    
7
    to 10 years

Computer
    equipment
    
5
    years

Warehouse
    and refrigeration equipment
    
10
    years

Leasehold
    improvements
    
7
    years

    
    
5
    years

Trade
    show booth
    
7
    years


Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected life of the improvement or the remaining
lease term.

The
Company capitalizes expenditures for major improvements and additions and expenses those items which do not improve or extend
the useful life of the fixed assets.

The
Company reviews fixed assets for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. At
December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company believes the carrying values of its long-lived assets are recoverable and as such
 the
Company did not record any impairment.

Other
Comprehensive (loss) Income

The
Company reports its comprehensive (loss) income in accordance with ASC 220
 
 which establishes standards
for reporting and presenting comprehensive (loss) income and its components in a full set of financial statements. Other comprehensive
(loss) income consists of net income (loss) and cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments.


    
    


Foreign
Currency Translation

The
Company&rsquo;s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. Dollars. The assets and liabilities held by the Company&rsquo;s
VIE have a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. They are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at
the end of each reporting period. The VIE&rsquo;s revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average rates that
prevailed during the period. The rates used in the financial statements as presented for December 31
 2018 and 2017 were 1.336
and 1.289 US dollar to UK pound sterling
 respectively. The resulting net translation gains and losses are reported as foreign
currency translation adjustments in stockholders&rsquo; equity as a component of comprehensive (loss) income. The Company recorded
foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately ($38
600) and $56
000 for the years ended December 31
 2018 and December
31
 2017
 respectively.

Revenue
Recognition

Effective
with the January 1
 2018 adoption of ASU 2014-09
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&rdquo; and the associated
ASUs (collectively
 &ldquo;Topic 606&rdquo;)
 the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods
or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
To determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company
performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the
contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

The
Company elected an accounting policy to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities. Consideration payable
to a customer is recorded as a reduction of the arrangement&rsquo;s transaction price
 thereby reducing the amount of revenue
recognized
 unless the payment is for distinct goods or services received from the customer.

In
periods prior to the adoption of Topic 606
 the Company&rsquo;s accounting policy was to recognize revenue when the products were
shipped
 the risks of ownership transferred to the customer and collectability was reasonably assured. Revenue was stated net
of sales returns and allowances. The incentives for sales discounts and promotions the Company offers to its customers were accounted
for as a reduction of revenue when they were characterized as cash consideration
 in accordance with ASC 605
 Revenue Recognition.
Otherwise
 the incentives were expensed.



The
Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising expenses which are included in Other Operating Expenses were
approximately $127
000 and $108
000
 for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.


    
    


Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Customer
Concentration

The
Company had three customers which accounted for approximately 65% and 63%
 of revenue during the years ended December 31
 2018
and 2017
 respectively. Outstanding receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 65% and 66% of the total accounts
receivable as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact
on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial position.

Supplier
Concentration

The
Company had three suppliers which accounted for approximately 87% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended
December 31
 2018. These three suppliers are located in two countries
 Indonesia
 and the Philippines
 which accounted for approximately
93% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended December 31
 2018.

The
Company had three suppliers which accounted for approximately 75% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended
December 31
 2017. These three suppliers are located in three countries
 Indonesia
 Philippines
 and China
 which accounted for
approximately 93% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases during the year ended December 31
 2017.

These
suppliers included Bacolod
 a related party
 which accounted for approximately 49% and 53% of the Company&rsquo;s total purchases
during the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

On
September 20
 2018
 the company entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement with a supplier that the company was engaged
in a commercial dispute. The settlement resulted in a reduction of the outstanding accounts payable to that supplier of $388
199
to a balance due of $1
465
000. The balance due to this supplier as of December 31
 2018 was approximately $1
297
800.

The
loss of any major supplier could have a material adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
position.


    
    


Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

Our
financial instruments include cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 and debt obligations. We believe
the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate their fair values because they are short term in nature or payable
on demand.

Earnings
or Loss per Share:

The
Company accounts for earnings per share pursuant to ASC 260
 Earnings per Share
 which requires disclosure on the financial statements
of &ldquo;basic&rdquo; and &ldquo;diluted&rdquo; earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing
net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents
(if dilutive) related to stock options and warrants for each year. As further described in Footnote 6 - Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock
 as of December 31
 2018
 1
413 shares of Preferred Stock could be converted into 706
500 shares of common stock. As further
described in Footnote 7 &ndash; Options &amp; Warrants
 as of December 31
 2018
 6
240
000 options may be exercised and 353
250
Warrants are eligible for exercise. There were no Preferred Stock
 Warrants or Options outstanding as of December 31
 2017

As
there was a net loss for the years ended December 31
 2018
 basic and diluted losses per share are the same.

Employee
Stock-Based Compensation:

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718
 &ldquo;Compensation-Stock Compensation&rdquo;. ASC 718
requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
 including
stock options
 based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
 usually the vesting period. The Company has elected to adopt
ASU 2016-09 and has a policy to account for forfeitures as they occur.

Non-Employee
Stock-Based Compensation:

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505-50
 &ldquo;Equity Based Payments to
Non-Employees
&rdquo; which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The
measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest.

Related
Parties:

The
Company accounts for related party transactions in accordance with ASC 850 (&ldquo;Related Party Disclosures&rdquo;). A party
is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries
 controls
is controlled by
 or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company
 its
management
 members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which
the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to
an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest
in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.


    
    


As
of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 there was $174
600 and $162
300 in interest paid to related parties on subordinated notes payable.
See Note 6 Stockholder Notes Payable and Note 4 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity for further information.



Certain
amounts in prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Income
Taxes

Accounting
policies:

Prior
to November 8
 2018
 the Company was taxed under the provisions of subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these provisions
the Company did not pay corporate federal income taxes on its taxable income but was liable for Florida corporate income taxes
and Texas Franchise Tax. The shareholder was liable for individual income taxes on the Company&rsquo;s taxable income. Post-merger
the Company file consolidated federal and state income tax returns.

Unaudited
pro forma amounts for income tax expense have been presented assuming the Company&rsquo;s pro forma effective tax rate of (2.56)%
for the year ended December 31
 2018
 and 68.09 % for the year ended December 31
 2017 as if it had been a C corporation during
those periods. The pro-forma provision for income taxes excludes information related to the Company&rsquo;s VIE.

Income
tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases
of assets and liabilities
 computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance
 if needed
 reduces deferred tax assets to
the amount expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted
through the provision for income taxes.

A
tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; that the tax position would be sustained
in a tax examination
 with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo;
test
 no tax benefit is recorded.

The
Company&rsquo;s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in &ldquo;Income tax expense&rdquo; in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no amounts related to interest and penalties recognized for the years ended
December 31
 2018 or 2017.


    
    


Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements


In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued ASU 2014-09
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with
Customers&rdquo;
 and has subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASUs (collectively
 &ldquo;ASC 606&rdquo;).
ASC 606 prescribes a single common revenue standard that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606
is intended to provide a more consistent interpretation and application of the principles outlined in the standard across filers
in multiple industries and within the same industries compared to current practices
 which should improve comparability. Adoption
of ASC 606 is required for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Upon adoption
 we must elect to adopt
either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or use the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative
effect of initial adoption recognized at the date of initial application. We adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective
method on January 1
 2018.

Under
ASC 606
 an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services
 in an amount that reflects
the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition
for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606
 the entity performs the following five steps: (i)
identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction
price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or
as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASC 606 also impacts certain other areas
 such as the accounting for costs
to obtain or fulfill a contract. The standard also requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

We
examined our revenue recognition policy specific to all revenue streams governing product sales and have come to conclusions on
the impact of the new standard using the 5-step process prescribed by ASC 606. We reviewed all of our contracts
 and determined
the potential impact to our accounting policies
 financial controls and operations. Our conclusions include recognizing revenue
on product sales once the product is sold to the distributor or retail customers.

As
noted above
 we used the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard. This means that we did not restate previously
issued financial statements
 but we recorded a one-time adjustment to retained earnings of ($81
520). This adjustment represents
the sales of our product to our customers prior to January 1
 2018
 that had not been delivered or in control of the customer.

The
cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated January 1
 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of ASC 606 was as follows:

Previously
we recognized revenue on product sales once the product left the company&rsquo;s warehouse. Effective January 1
 2018
 we began
recognizing revenue when our customers
 take control of our product be it a shipment or upon delivery. This will have the impact
of us recognizing revenue approximately seven calendar days later than before adopting the new standard. The following financial
statement line items for twelve months ended December 31
 2018 were affected as a result of the adoption:

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance ASU No. 2016-02
 &ldquo;Leases&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2016-02&rdquo;)
as amended by ASU 2018-10
 &ldquo;Codification Improvements to Topic 842
 Leases&rdquo; and ASU 2018-11
 &ldquo;Leases (Topic
842): Targeted Improvements.&rdquo; Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required to recognize a
lease liability
 which is a lessee&rsquo;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis;
and a right-of-use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&rsquo;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified
asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is
largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December
15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance.

ASC
842 was previously required to be adopted using the modified retrospective approach. However
 in July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU
2018-11
 which allows for retrospective application with the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Under this option
 entities would not need to apply ASC 842 (along with its disclosure
requirements) to the comparative prior periods presented.

Management
expects that most of its operating leases (primarily warehouse space) will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right
of use assets on its consolidated balance sheet. The Company has elected to adopt certain of the optional practical expedients
including the package of practical expedients
 which
 among other things
 gives the option to not reassess: 1) whether expired
or existing contracts are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for expired or existing leases; and 3) initial direct
costs for existing leases.


    
    




Note
    3.
Going
    Concern


The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going
concern. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company incurred a net loss of $2
277
116
 has an accumulated deficit of
$3
853
139 and working capital deficit of $1
146
937
 inclusive of $2
910
136 in subordinated stockholder debt. The company
does have a positive cash flow from operations. These circumstances raise substantial doubt as to the Company&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern. The Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
Company&rsquo;s ability to increase revenues
 execute on its business plan to acquire complimentary companies
 raise capital
and to continue to sustain adequate working capital to finance its operations. The failure to achieve the necessary levels of
profitability and cash flows would be detrimental to the Company. The consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.




    
    



Effective
April 1
 2014
 the Company&rsquo;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike (see Note 2). The Company concluded
that Strike is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary of Strike
 in accordance with ASC 810
. Therefore
the Company consolidated Strike in its financial statements. Strike&rsquo;s activities are reflected in the Company&rsquo;s financial
statements starting on April 1
 2014
 the effective date of the controlling interest transfer. Strike was not a VIE of the

Company
and the Company was not the primary beneficiary of Strike prior to the effective date of the controlling interest transfer of
April 1
 2014. Strike&rsquo;s equity is classified as non-controlling interest in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements since
the Company is not a shareholder of Strike.

The
information below represents the assets
 liabilities and non-controlling interest related to Strike as of December 31
 2017 and

Working
Capital Line of Credit

The
Company entered into a $14
000
000 revolving line of credit with ACF Finco I
 LP on August 31
 2016
 the proceeds of which were
used to pay off the prior line of credit
 pay new loan costs of approximately $309
000
 and provide additional working capital
to the company. This facility was amended on November 18
 2016
 June 19
 2017
 October 16
 2017
 September 19
 2018 and November
8
 2018. In the fourth amendment the term of this facility was extended to a term of 5 years from the effective date and is subject
to early termination by the lender upon defined events of default. The Company continues to be obligated to meet certain financial
covenants.

The
line of credit bears an interest rate equal to the greater of 3 Month LIBOR rate plus 6.25%
 the Prime rate plus 3.0% or a fixed
rate of 6.5%.



    
    



The
Ares line of credit agreement is subject to the following terms:



    
    
Borrowing
    is based on up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory at the
    same rate
 subject to certain defined limitations.

    
    
The
    line is collateralized by substantially all the assets and property of the Company and is personally guaranteed by the stockholder
    of the Company.

    
    
The
    Company is restricted to specified distribution payments
 use of funds
 and is required to comply with certain other covenants
    including certain financial ratios.

    
    
All
    cash received by the Company is applied against the outstanding loan balance.

    
    
A
    subjective acceleration clause allows Ares to call the note upon a material adverse change.


During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company failed to meet certain financial covenants. The bank issued the fourth amendment
to the loan and security agreement dated September 19
 2018 waiving the defaults of the financial covenants
 and resetting certain
financial covenants. The Company is in compliance with all bank covenants as of December 31
 2018.

On
November 8
 2018
 Inc. the company entered into the fifth amendment to the loan and security agreement with Ares Financial. This
amendment memorialized the change in ownership of John Keeler &amp; Co.
 Inc as a wholly owned subsidiary of Blue Star Foods Corp.
as well as the change of John Keeler from CEO to Executive Chairman
 and the appointment of Carlos Faria as the CEO of John Keeler
&amp; Co.
 Inc.

The
Company analyzed the Line of Credit modification under ASC 470-50-40-21 and determined that the modification did not trigger any
additional accounting due to the revolving line of credit remain unchanged

As
of December 31
 2018
 the line of credit bears interest rate of 8.96%.

As
of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the line of credit had an outstanding balance of approximately $8
204
000 and $12
100
000
 respectively.

The
Company amortizes loan costs on a straight-line basis
 which approximates the interest method
 over the term of the credit facility.
The Company added loan costs associated with the working capital lines of credit of approximately $70
000 and $115
000
for the twelve months ending December 31
 2018 and 2017
 leaving balances in the asset of $109
200 and $195
000
 net of approximately
$384
500 and $229
000 of accumulated amortization as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The Company recorded amortization
expense of approximately $155
500 and $164
000 during the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

Tax
periods for all fiscal years after 2014 remain open to examination by the federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which the
Company is subject. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company has federal net operating loss of $520
857 to be carried forward indefinitely.

ASC
740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo;
that all
 or a portion of
 deferred tax assets will not be recognized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence
needs to be considered
 including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 and tax
planning strategies. After consideration of all the information available
 management believes that uncertainty exists with respect
to future realization of its deferred tax assets and has
 therefore
 established a full valuation allowance as of December 31
2018.

As
of December 31
 2018
 the Company has evaluated and concluded that there were no material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition
in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements. The Company&rsquo;s policy is to classify assessments
 if any
 for tax related interest
as income tax expenses. No interest or penalties were recorded during the years ended December 31
 2018.


    
    





    
    


Office
lease
The
Company leases its office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate
 a related party through common family beneficial ownership
(see Note 2). The lease has a 20 year term
 expiring in July 2021. The Company is a guarantor of the mortgage on the facility
which had a balance of approximately $1
307
000 at December 31
 2018; the Company&rsquo;s maximum exposure. The Company deems
that rental income on this lease is sufficient to cover the loan payments under this mortgage. Therefore
 the Company did not
record any liability related to the mortgage in the consolidated financial statements as the Company does not believe it will
be called upon to perform under this guarantee
 in accordance with ASC 460
 



At
December 31
 2018
 future minimum lease payments under operating lease agreements are as follows:

Rental
and equipment lease expenses amounted to approximately $213
600 and $211
000 for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

On
November 27
 2018 the company was issued a settlement letter in relation to a threatened lawsuit by a former employee. On March
26
 2019
 the company responded to this letter with a settlement offer of approximately $40
000. The company has fully reserved
for this settlement amount in the December 31
 2018 financial statements. The company has received no further communications regarding
this settlement.




    
    


The
Company provides and sponsors a 401(k) plan for its employees. For the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 no contributions
were made to the plan by the Company.




    
    


On
December 20
 2018
 the Board of Directors granted stock options to purchase an aggregate of 705
000 shares of common stock at
an exercise price of $2.00 per share to certain employees and service providers
 effective January 15
 2019.

On
February 1
 2019
 the Company sold 5
000 shares at $2.00 per share to one investor in a private offering.

On
March 26
 2019
 the Company issued a four-month promissory note in the principal amount of $1
000
000 to Kenar Overseas Corp.
a company registered in Panama (the &ldquo;Lender&rdquo;). The term of the note may be extended for an additional two months at
the Lender&rsquo;s discretion. The note bears interest at the rate of 18% per annum during the initial four months which rate
will increase to 24% during any extension thereof. The note may be prepaid in whole or in part without penalty. John Keeler
the Company&rsquo;s Executive Chairman pledged 5
000
000 shares of common stock to secure the Company&rsquo;s obligations under
the note.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer
 as of December 31
 2018
 we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined
under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended. Based on this evaluation
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that
 based on the material weaknesses discussed
below
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act were recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms and that our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 or persons
performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by
or under the supervision of
 our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors
management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:



    
    
Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    our assets;

    
    
    

    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that our receipts and expenditures are being
    made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors; and

    
    
    

    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems
no matter how well designed
 have inherent limitations. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control
 there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
over financial reporting. However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk.

Immediately
following the Merger
 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 existing as
of December 31
 2018
 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control&mdash;Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;) and SEC guidance
on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation
 we believe that
 during the period covered by this report
 such internal
controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below.
This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely
affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.


    
    


As
a result of the foregoing
 the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material
weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were:



    
    
The
    Company&rsquo;s lack of an audit committee with a financial expert and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within
    the financial reporting process; and

    
    
    

    
    
inadequate
    segregation of duties consistent with control objectives
 including lack of personnel resources and technical accounting expertise
    within the accounting function of the Company.


Management
believes that the material weaknesses that were identified did not have an effect on our financial results. However
 management
believes that these weaknesses
 if not properly remediated
 could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements
in future periods.

Management&rsquo;s
Remediation Initiatives

At
the time of the Merger
 we appointed new members of senior management
 including a new Chief Financial Officer. In an effort to
remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls
 we plan to further initiate
the following measures
 subject to the availability of required resources:



    
    
We
    plan to establish an audit committee
 including an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert&rdquo; as defined by applicable
    SEC rules
 that has the requisite financial sophistication as defined under the applicable Nasdaq rules and regulations; and

    
    
    

    
    
We
plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and hire personnel resources with technical accounting
expertise within the accounting function.


This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over
financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to rules of the SEC that exempt smaller reporting companies from this requirement.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that have
materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 entity or organization that has disciplinary authority
    over its members or persons associated with a member.


Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who beneficially own more
than 10% percent of our equity securities (&ldquo;Reporting Persons&rdquo;) to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership
with the SEC. Based solely on our review of copies of such reports and representations from the Reporting Persons
 we believe
that during the fiscal year ended December 31
 2018
 the Reporting Persons timely filed all such reports
 except:



    
    
On
    October 17
 2017
 Howard Gostfrand was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our board of directors.
    In connection with his appointment
 American Capital Ventures
 Inc.
 a company controlled by Mr. Gostfrand
 purchased 5
000
000
    founder&rsquo;s shares for an aggregate of $2
000
 representing 50% of the Company&rsquo;s equity ownership. No Form 3 was
    filed on Mr. Gostfrand&rsquo;s behalf.

    
    
    

    
    
On
    October 17
 2017
 Laura Anthony was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer and as a member of our board of directors. In
    connection with her appointment
 Leone Group
 LLC
 a company controlled by Ms. Anthony
 purchased 5
000
000 founder&rsquo;s
    shares for an aggregate of $2
000
 representing 50% of the Company&rsquo;s equity ownership. No Form 3 was filed on Ms. Anthony&rsquo;s
    behalf.


Code
of Ethics

We
intend to adopt a code of ethics that applies to our officers
 directors and employees
 including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer
 but have not done so to date due to our relatively small size.

Board
Committees

The
Company has no nominating
 audit or compensation committees at this time. The entire board of directors participates in the nomination
and audit oversight processes and considers executive and director compensation. The entire board of directors is involved in
such decision-making processes. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority
to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We
are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors.


    
    


Role
of Board in Risk Oversight Process

Risk
assessment and oversight are an integral part of our governance and management processes. Our board of directors encourages management
to promote a culture that incorporates risk management into our corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations. Management
discusses strategic and operational risks at regular management meetings and conducts strategic planning and review sessions during
the year that include a discussion and analysis of the risks facing us.

Board
Diversity

Upon
consummation of the Merger
 the board of directors will review
 on an annual basis
 the appropriate characteristics
 skills and
experience required for the board of directors as a whole and its individual members. In evaluating the suitability of individual
candidates (both new candidates and current members)
 the board of directors
 in approving (and
 in the case of vacancies
 appointing)
such candidates
 will take into account many factors
 including the following:



    
    
personal
    and professional integrity;

    
    
    

    
    
ethics
    and values;

    
    
    

    
    
experience
    in the industries in which we compete;

    
    
    

    
    
experience
    as a director or executive officer of another publicly held company;

    
    
    

    
    
diversity
    of expertise and experience in substantive matters pertaining to our business relative to other board members;

    
    
    

    
    
conflicts
    of interest; and

    
    
    

    
    
practical
    business judgment.


Shareholder
Communications

We
have not yet established a process for shareholder communications.

Our
executive officers have basic health benefits that are generally available to all of our employees.

We
offer a 401(k) plan to eligible employees
 including our executive officers. In accordance with this plan
 all eligible employees
may contribute a percentage of compensation up to a maximum of the statutory limits per year. We intend for the 401(k) plan to
qualify
 depending on the employee&rsquo;s election
 under Section 401(a) of the Code
 so that contributions by employees
 and
income earned on those contributions
 are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the 401(k) plan.

 2018.

2018
Equity Incentive Plan

We
have adopted the 2018 Plan that provides for the grant of up to 7
500
000 shares of common stock. Under the 2018 Plan
 we are
authorized to issue incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Code and non-qualified stock options.
The 2018 Plan is administered by our board of directors. In connection with the Merger
 we issued options to purchase an aggregate
of 6
240
000 million shares of common stock to certain executive officers and directors.


    
    


Share
Reserve
500
000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan pursuant to a variety of stock-based
compensation awards
 including stock options
 stock appreciation rights(&ldquo;SARs&rdquo;)
 restricted stock awards
 restricted
stock unit awards
 deferred stock awards
 dividend equivalent awards
 stock payment awards
 performance awards and other stock-based
awards.

&#9679;
to the extent that an award terminates
 expires or lapses for any reason or an award is settled in cash without the delivery of
shares
 any shares subject to the award at such time will be available for future grants under the 2018 Plan;

&#9679;
to the extent shares are tendered or withheld to satisfy the grant
 exercise price or tax withholding obligation with respect
to any award under the 2018 Plan
 such tendered or withheld shares will be available for future grants under the 2018 Plan;

&#9679;
to the extent that shares of common stock are repurchased by us prior to vesting so that shares are returned to us
 such shares
will be available for future grants under the 2018 Plan;

&#9679;
the payment of dividend equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding awards will not be counted against the shares
available for issuance under the 2018 Plan; and

&#9679;
to the extent permitted by applicable law or any exchange rule
 shares issued in assumption of
 or in substitution for
 any outstanding
awards of any entity acquired in any form of combination by us or any of our subsidiaries will not be counted against the shares
available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.

Administration.

The compensation committee must consist of at least three members of our board of directors
 each of whom is intended to qualify
as an &ldquo;outside director
&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code
 a &ldquo;non-employee director&rdquo;
for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and an &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules.
The 2018 Plan provides that the board of directors or compensation committee may delegate its authority to grant awards to employees
other than executive officers to a committee consisting of one or more members of our board of directors or one or more of our
officers
 other than awards made to our non-employee directors
 which must be approved by our full board of directors.

Subject
to the terms and conditions of the 2018 Plan
 the administrator has the authority to select the persons to whom awards are to
be made
 to determine the number of shares to be subject to awards and the terms and conditions of awards
 and to make all other
determinations and to take all other actions necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2018 Plan. The administrator
is also authorized to adopt
 amend or rescind rules relating to administration of the 2018 Plan. Our board of directors may at
any time remove the compensation committee as the administrator and revest in itself the authority to administer the 2018 Plan.
The full board of directors will administer the 2018 Plan with respect to awards to non-employee directors.

Eligibility.

 SARs
 restricted stock and all other stock-based and cash-based awards under the 2018 Plan may be granted to individuals
who are then our officers
 employees or consultants or are the officers
 employees or consultants of subsidiaries. Such awards
also may be granted to our directors. Only employees of the Company or certain subsidiaries may be granted ISOs.

Awards.

 SARs
 restricted stock awards
 restricted
stock unit awards
 deferred stock awards
 deferred stock unit awards
 dividend equivalent awards
 performance awards
 stock payment
awards and other stock-based and cash-based awards
 or any combination thereof. Each award will be set forth in a separate agreement
with the person receiving the award and will indicate the type
 terms and conditions of the award.

Nonstatutory
Stock Options (&ldquo;NSOs&rdquo;)
may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant
 and usually will become exercisable
(at the discretion of the administrator) in one or more installments after the grant date
 subject to the participant&rsquo;s
continued employment or service with us and/or subject to the satisfaction of corporate performance targets and individual performance
targets established by the administrator. NSOs may be granted for any term specified by the administrator that does not exceed
10 years.


    
    


Incentive
Stock Options (&ldquo;ISOs&rdquo;)
Code and will be subject to specified restrictions contained in the Code. Among such restrictions
 ISOs must have an exercise
price of not less than the fair market value of a share of our Common Stock on the date of grant
 may only be granted to employees
and must not be exercisable after a period of 10 years measured from the date of grant. In the case of an ISO granted to an individual
who owns (or is deemed to own) at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our capital stock
 the 2018 Plan
provides that the exercise price must be at least 110% of the fair market value of a share of our Common Stock on the date of
grant and the ISO must not be exercisable after a period of five years measured from the date of grant.

Restricted
Stock Awards 
Restricted stock
 typically
 may be forfeited for no consideration or repurchased by us at the original purchase price if the
conditions or restrictions on vesting are not met. In general
 restricted stock may not be sold or otherwise transferred until
restrictions are removed or expire. Purchasers of restricted stock
 unlike recipients of options
 will have voting rights and
will have the right to receive dividends
 if any
 prior to the time when the restrictions lapse; however
 extraordinary dividends
will generally be placed in escrow
 and will not be released until restrictions are removed or expire.

Restricted
Stock Unit Awards
 typically without payment of consideration
 but subject to vesting
conditions based on continued employment or service or on performance criteria established by the administrator. Like restricted
stock
 restricted stock units may not be sold
 or otherwise transferred or hypothecated
 until vesting conditions are removed
or expire. Unlike restricted stock
 stock underlying restricted stock units will not be issued until the restricted stock units
have vested
 and recipients of restricted stock units generally will have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when
vesting conditions are satisfied.

Deferred
Stock Awards
hypothecated or transferred until issued. Deferred stock will not be issued until the deferred stock award has vested
 and recipients
of deferred stock generally will have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when the vesting conditions are satisfied
and the shares are issued. Deferred stock awards generally will be forfeited
 and the underlying shares of deferred stock will
not be issued
 if the applicable vesting conditions and other restrictions are not met.

Deferred
Stock Units
criteria set by the administrator. The common stock underlying deferred stock units will not be issued until the deferred stock
units have vested
 and recipients of deferred stock units generally will have no voting rights prior to the time when vesting
conditions are satisfied.

Stock
Appreciation Rights (&ldquo;SARS&rdquo;)

 or separately.
SARs granted in connection with stock options or other awards typically will provide for payments to the holder based upon increases
in the price of our Common Stock over a set exercise price. The exercise price of any SAR granted under the 2018 Plan must be
at least 100% of the fair market value of a share of our Common Stock on the date of grant. Except as required by Section 162(m)
of the Code with respect to a SAR intended to qualify as performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m) of the
Code
 there are no restrictions specified in the 2018 Plan on the exercise of SARs or the amount of gain realizable therefrom
although restrictions may be imposed by the administrator in the SAR agreements. SARs under the 2018 Plan will be settled in cash
or shares of common stock
 or in a combination of both
 at the election of the administrator.

Dividend
Equivalent Awards
 if any
 per share paid by us
 calculated with reference to the number
of shares covered by the award. Dividend equivalents may be settled in cash or shares and at such times as determined by our compensation
committee or board of directors
 as applicable.

Performance
Awards 
 these awards will be based upon specific
performance targets and may be paid in cash or in common stock or in a combination of both. Performance awards may include &ldquo;phantom&rdquo;
stock awards that provide for payments based upon the value of our Common Stock. Performance awards may also include bonuses that
may be granted by the administrator on an individual or group basis and that may be payable in cash or in common stock or in a
combination of both.

common stock as part of a deferred compensation or other arrangement in lieu of all or any part of compensation
 including bonuses
that would otherwise be payable in cash to the employee
 consultant or non-employee director.

Change
in Control
consummation of such transaction
 awards issued under the 2018 Plan will be subject to accelerated vesting such that 100% of such
awards will become vested and exercisable or payable
 as applicable. Performance awards will vest in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the applicable award agreement. In the event that
 within the 12 month period immediately following a change
in control
 a participant&rsquo;s services with us are terminated by us other than for cause (as defined in the 2018 Plan) or
by such participant for good reason (as defined in the 2018 Plan)
 then the vesting and
 if applicable
 exercisability of 100%
of the then-unvested shares subject to the outstanding equity awards held by such participant under the 2018 Plan will accelerate
effective as of the date of such termination. The administrator may also make appropriate adjustments to awards under the 2018
Plan and is authorized to provide for the acceleration
 cash-out
 termination
 assumption
 substitution or conversion of such
awards in the event of a change in control or certain other unusual or nonrecurring events or transactions. Under the 2018 Plan
a change in control is generally defined as:

&#9679;
the transfer or exchange in a single transaction or series of related transactions by our stockholders of more than 50% of our
voting stock to a person or group;

&#9679;
a change in the composition of our board of directors over a two-year period such that the members of the board of directors who
were approved by at least two-thirds of the directors who were directors at the beginning of the two-year period or whose election
or nomination was so approved cease to constitute a majority of the board of directors;

&#9679;
a merger
 consolidation
 reorganization or business combination in which we are involved
 directly or indirectly
 other than a
merger
 consolidation
 reorganization or business combination that results in our outstanding voting securities immediately before
the transaction continuing to represent a majority of the voting power of the acquiring company&rsquo;s outstanding voting securities
and after which no person or group beneficially owns 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving entity
immediately after the transaction; or

&#9679;
stockholder approval of our liquidation or dissolution.

Adjustments
of Awards
 stock split
 spin-off
 recapitalization
 distribution of our assets to stockholders
(other than normal cash dividends) or any other corporate event affecting the number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock
or the share price of our Common Stock other than an &ldquo;equity restructuring&rdquo; (as defined below)
 the administrator
may make appropriate
 proportionate adjustments to reflect the event giving rise to the need for such adjustments
 with respect
to:

&#9679;
the aggregate number and type of shares subject to the 2018 Plan;

&#9679;
the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding awards and terms and conditions of outstanding awards (including
 without
limitation
 any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect to such awards); and

&#9679;
the grant or exercise price per share of any outstanding awards under the 2018 Plan.

In
the event of one of the adjustments described above or other corporate transactions
 in order to prevent dilution or enlargement
of the potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2018 Plan
 the administrator has the discretion to make such
equitable adjustments and may also:

&#9679;
provide for the termination or replacement of an award in exchange for cash or other property;

&#9679;
provide that any outstanding award cannot vest
 be exercised or become payable after such event;


    
    


&#9679;
provide that awards may be exercisable
 payable or fully vested as to shares of common stock covered thereby; or

&#9679;
provide that an award under the 2018 Plan cannot vest
 be exercised or become payable after such event.

In
the event of an equity restructuring
 the administrator will make appropriate
 proportionate adjustments to the number and type
of securities subject to each outstanding award and the exercise price or grant price thereof
 if applicable. In addition
 the
administrator will make equitable adjustments
 as the administrator in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect such equity
restructuring
 with respect to the aggregate number and type of shares subject to the 2018 Plan. The adjustments upon an equity
restructuring are nondiscretionary and will be final and binding on the affected holders and the Company.

For
purposes of the 2018 Plan
 &ldquo;equity restructuring&rdquo; means a nonreciprocal transaction between us and our stockholders
such as a stock dividend
 stock split
 spin-off
 rights offering or recapitalization through a large
 nonrecurring cash dividend
that affects the number or kind of shares (or other securities) or the share price of our Common Stock (or other securities) and
causes a change in the per share value of the common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards granted under the 2018 Plan.
In the event of a stock split in connection with an offering
 the administrator will proportionately adjust (i) the number of
shares subject to any outstanding award under the 2018 Plan
 (ii) the exercise or grant price of any such awards
 if applicable
and (iii) the aggregate number of shares subject to the 2018 Plan.

Amendment
and Termination
 amend or modify
the 2018 Plan at any time and from time to time. However
 we must generally obtain stockholder approval:

&#9679;
to increase the number of shares available under the 2018 Plan (other than in connection with certain corporate events
 as described
above);

&#9679;
reduce the price per share of any outstanding option or SAR granted under the 2018 Plan;

&#9679;
cancel any option or SAR in exchange for cash or another award when the option or SAR price per share exceeds the fair market
value of the underlying shares; or

&#9679;
to the extent required by applicable law
 rule or regulation (including any NASDAQ rule).

Termination.

10th anniversary of the effective date of the 2018 Plan
 and no additional annual share increases to the 2018 Plan&rsquo;s aggregate
share limit will occur from and after such anniversary. Any award that is outstanding on the termination date of the 2018 Plan
will remain in force according to the terms of the 2018 Plan and the applicable award agreement.

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

The
following table sets forth information relating to the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock at March 29
 2019
 by:



    
each
    person
 or group of affiliated persons
 known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock;
    

    
    

    
each
    of our directors; 

    
    

    
each
    of our named executive officers; and 

    
    

    
all
    current directors and executive officers as a group. 


The
number of shares beneficially owned by each entity
 person
 director or executive officer is determined in accordance with the
rules of the SEC
 and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such
rules
 beneficial ownership includes any shares over which the individual has sole or shared voting power or investment power
as well as any shares that the individual has the right to acquire within 60 days through the exercise of any stock option
 warrants
or other rights. Except as otherwise indicated
 and subject to applicable community property laws
 the persons named in the table
have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock held by such person.

percentage of shares beneficially owned is computed on the basis of 16
028
164 shares of common stock outstanding as of

 2019. Shares of common stock that a person has the right to acquire within 60 days are deemed outstanding for purposes
of computing the percentage ownership of the person holding such rights but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing
the percentage ownership of any other person

Audit
Committee&rsquo;s Pre-Approval Practice

Prior
to our engagement of our independent auditor
 such engagement was approved by our board of directors. The services provided under
this engagement may include audit services
 audit-related services
 tax services and other services. Pre-approval is generally
provided for up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally
subject to a specific budget. Pursuant our requirements
 the independent auditors and management are required to report to our
board of directors at least quarterly regarding the extent of services provided by the independent auditors in accordance with
this pre-approval
 and the fees for the services performed to date. Our board of directors may also pre-approve particular services
on a case-by-case basis. All audit-related fees
 tax fees and other fees incurred by us for the year ended December 31
 2019 and
by our predecessor
 AG Acquisition Group II
 Inc.
 for the years ended October 31
 2018 and 2017 were approved by our board of
directors.

Pre-Approval
of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services

We
have not yet established an audit committee. Until then
 there are no formal pre-approval policies and procedures. Nonetheless
the auditors engaged for these services are required to provide and uphold estimates for the cost of services to be rendered.
The percentage of hours expended on Brooks and Malone Bailey&rsquo;s respective engagement to audit our financial statements for
the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the principal accountant&rsquo;s full-time
permanent employees was 0%.

Promptly
    after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any Action
 such indemnified party
    will
 if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9
 notify the indemnifying
    party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from
    any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 9. In case any such Action is brought
    against any indemnified party
 and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof
 the indemnifying party
    will be entitled to participate therein
 and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified
    party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party
 to assume the defense thereof
 with counsel
    satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided
 however
 if the defendants in any such Action include both the indemnified
    party and the indemnifying party and either (i) the indemnifying party or parties and the indemnified party or parties mutually
    agree or (ii) representation of both the indemnifying party or parties and the indemnified party or parties by the same counsel
    is inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct due to actual or potential differing interests between
    them
 the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to
    otherwise participate in the defense of such Action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice
    from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such Action and approval
    by the indemnified party of counsel
 the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section
    9 for any reasonable legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
    thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed counsel in connection with the assumption of legal defenses in
    accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood
 however
 that the indemnifying party shall
    not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel in such circumstance)
 (ii) the indemnifying party shall
    not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time
    after notice of commencement of the Action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the
    indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent
    of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
 settle or compromise or consent to the entry
    of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened Action in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be
    sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such Action) unless such settlement
    compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such Action
    or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such Action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
    withheld)
 but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such Action
 the
    indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason
    of such settlement or judgment.

 as defined in ASC 810
 the VIE&#13;must be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner is the primary beneficiary&#13;of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights

 the&#13;Company&amp;#8217;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. (&amp;#8220;Strike&amp;#8221;)
 a related&#13;party entity which holds the Company&amp;#8217;s inventory on consignment in United Kingdom (see Note 3). The Company evaluated its&#13;interest in Strike and determined that Strike is a VIE due to the Company&amp;#8217;s implicit interest in Strike and the fact that&#13;Strike and the Company were under common control after the transfer of the controlling interest. Moreover
 the Company determined&#13;that it is the primary beneficiary of Strike due to the fact that the Company had both the power to direct the activities that&#13;most significantly impact Strike and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Strike. Therefore

 Bacolod Blue Star Export Corp. (&amp;#8220;Bacolod&amp;#8221;)

 in light of&#13;ASC 810. The Company purchased inventory from Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company&#13;purchased inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate

 Bacolod&#13;and Bicol have other customers besides the Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&amp;#8217;s customer
 they would&#13;be able to sustain their operations from selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company concluded that Bacolod&#13;and Bicol are not VIE&amp;#8217;s and the Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary

&#13;JK Real Estate&amp;#8217;s equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance its activities without subordinated&#13;financial support. Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted on behalf of the Company&amp;#8217;s stockholder.&#13;The Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate since the Company does not have the power to direct&#13;the activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore


 2018 the Company&#13;adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18

 and the purpose of the&#13;funds is restricted to repayment of the line of credit. As of December 31
 2018 and 2017 restricted cash was approximately $334
500&#13;and $29


 2018 and 2017
 the Company recorded sales return and allowances and refund liability of approximately $159

 2018&#13;and December 31
 2017
 this represents a reduction of approximately $88
600 from the year ending December 31

&#13;the Company may advance payments to its suppliers

&amp;#8221; and the associated ASUs (collectively
&#13;&amp;#8220;Topic 606&amp;#8221;)
 the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an&#13;amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine&#13;revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company performs the&#13;following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (3)&#13;determine the transaction price

 thereby reducing the amount of revenue recognized

 the Company&amp;#8217;s accounting policy was to recognize revenue when the products were shipped
 the risks of ownership&#13;transferred to the customer and collectability was reasonably assured. Revenue was stated net of sales returns and allowances.&#13;The incentives for sales discounts and promotions the Company offers to its customers were accounted for as a reduction of revenue&#13;when they were characterized as cash consideration

 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact&#13;on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the Financial&#13;Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued ASU 2014-09
 &amp;#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&amp;#8221;
 and has&#13;subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASUs (collectively
 &amp;#8220;ASC 606&amp;#8221;). ASC 606 prescribes a single&#13;common revenue standard that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 is intended to provide a more&#13;consistent interpretation and application of the principles outlined in the standard across filers in multiple industries and within&#13;the same industries compared to current practices
 which should improve comparability. Adoption of ASC 606 is required for annual&#13;and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Upon adoption
 we must elect to adopt either retrospectively to each prior&#13;reporting period presented or use the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized&#13;at the date of initial application. We adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective method on January 1

 an entity&#13;recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services
 in an amount that reflects the consideration&#13;which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements&#13;that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606
 the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s)&#13;with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate&#13;the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies&#13;a performance obligation. ASC 606 also impacts certain other areas
 such as the accounting for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.&#13;The standard also requires disclosure of the nature
 amount

 and determined the potential impact&#13;to our accounting policies

 we used&#13;the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard. This means that we did not restate previously issued financial statements
&#13;but we recorded a one-time adjustment to retained earnings of ($81
520). This adjustment represents the sales of our product to&#13;our customers prior to January 1
 2018

&#13;the Company has evaluated and concluded that there were no material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;financial statements. The Company&amp;#8217;s policy is to classify assessments

 John&#13;Keeler &amp;#38; Co.
 Inc. has been in business for approximately twenty-one years. The Company was formed under the laws of the State&#13;of Delaware. The current source of revenue is importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Indonesia
 Philippines and&#13;China and distributing it in the United States of America
 Canada and Europe under several brand names such as Blue Star
 Oceanica

 2018 the sole&#13;shareholder of John Keeler &amp;#38; Co.
 Inc. executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with Blue Star Foods Corp.&#13;(Formerly A.G. Acquisition Group II
 Inc.) and Blue Star Acquisition Corp. John R. Keeler exchanged his 500 shares with a par value&#13;of $1.00 in John Keeler &amp;#38; Co.
 Inc. for the 15
000
000 shares with a par value of $.0001 of the then outstanding 16
015
000&#13;outstanding shares. As part of the merger
 the net liabilities existing in the company as of the date of the merger totaling approximately&#13;$2
400 were converted to equity as part of this transaction. The prior owners of Blue Star Foods Corp. received 750
000 shares&#13;of common stock as part of this transaction
 and various service providers received 265
000 shares as compensation for their work&#13;on the transaction resulting in and expense and additional paid in capital of $530
001. Additionally
 there were 725 Series A Preferred&#13;shares and 181
250 warrants issued to private placement investors for total capital contribution of $725
000
 688 Series A Preferred&#13;shares and 172
000 warrants issued for settlement with prior investors which had a fair value of $688
000 and $81
353 respectively.&#13;Lastly
 upon the close of the merger there were 3
120
000 options to purchase common stock issued to Christopher Constable. Additionally
&#13;Carlos Faria held options to purchase 104 shares of John Keeler &amp;#38; Co.
 Inc. prior to the merger. These options were immediately&#13;converted at closing to 3
120

 immediately following the completion of&#13;the transaction
 the holders of John Keeler &amp;#38; Co.
 Inc.&amp;#8217;s stock will have effective control of Blue Star Foods Corp.&#13;In addition
 John Keeler &amp;#38; Co.
 Inc. will have control of the combined entity through control of the Board by designating&#13;all four of the board seats. Additionally
 all of John Keeler &amp;#38; Co.
 Inc.&amp;#8217;s officers and senior executive positions&#13;will continue on as management of the combined entity after consummation of the Merger. For accounting purposes
 John Keeler &amp;#38;&#13;Co.
 Inc. will be deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and
 consequently
 the transaction has been treated&#13;as a recapitalization of Blue Star Foods Corp. Accordingly
 John Keeler &amp;#38; Co.
 Inc.&amp;#8217;s assets
 liabilities and results&#13;of operations are the historical financial statements of the registrant
 and the John Keeler &amp;#38; Co.
 Inc.&amp;#8217;s assets

The company does have a positive cash flow from operations.&#13;These circumstances raise substantial doubt as to the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to increase revenues

 a related party through common family beneficial ownership (see Note 2). The lease&#13;has a 20 year term
 expiring in July 2021. The Company is a guarantor of the mortgage on the facility which had a balance of approximately&#13;$1

000 at December 31
 2018; the Company&amp;#8217;s maximum exposure. The Company deems that rental income on this lease is sufficient&#13;to cover the loan payments under this mortgage. Therefore
 the Company did not record any liability related to the mortgage in&#13;the consolidated financial statements as the Company does not believe it will be called upon to perform under this guarantee
 in&#13;accordance with ASC 460

 the Financial&#13;Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued ASU 2014-09
 &amp;#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&amp;#8221;
 and has&#13;subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASUs (collectively
 &amp;#8220;ASC 606&amp;#8221;). ASC 606 prescribes a single&#13;common revenue standard that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 is intended to provide a more&#13;consistent interpretation and application of the principles outlined in the standard across filers in multiple industries and within&#13;the same industries compared to current practices
 which should improve comparability. Adoption of ASC 606 is required for annual&#13;and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Upon adoption
 we must elect to adopt either retrospectively to each prior&#13;reporting period presented or use the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized&#13;at the date of initial application. We adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective method on January 1

 an entity&#13;recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services
 in an amount that reflects the consideration&#13;which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements&#13;that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606
 the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s)&#13;with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate&#13;the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies&#13;a performance obligation. ASC 606 also impacts certain other areas
 such as the accounting for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.&#13;The standard also requires disclosure of the nature
 amount

 and determined the potential impact&#13;to our accounting policies

 we used&#13;the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard. This means that we did not restate previously issued financial statements
&#13;but we recorded a one-time adjustment to retained earnings of ($81
520). This adjustment represents the sales of our product to&#13;our customers prior to January 1

 we recognized revenue&#13;on product sales once the product left the company&amp;#8217;s warehouse. Effective January 1
 2018
 we began recognizing revenue when&#13;our customers
 take control of our product be it a shipment or upon delivery. This will have the impact of us recognizing revenue&#13;approximately seven calendar days later than before adopting the new standard. The following financial statement line items for&#13;twelve months ended December 31

 &lt;i&gt;Consolidation&lt;/i&gt;
 when a reporting entity&#13;is the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (&amp;#8220;VIE&amp;#8221;)
 as defined in ASC 810
 the VIE&#13;must be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner is the primary beneficiary&#13;of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights
 obligations

 2014
 the&#13;Company&amp;#8217;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. (&amp;#8220;Strike&amp;#8221;)
 a related&#13;party entity which holds the Company&amp;#8217;s inventory on consignment in United Kingdom (see Note 3). The Company evaluated its&#13;interest in Strike and determined that Strike is a VIE due to the Company&amp;#8217;s implicit interest in Strike and the fact that&#13;Strike and the Company were under common control after the transfer of the controlling interest. Moreover
 the Company determined&#13;that it is the primary beneficiary of Strike due to the fact that the Company had both the power to direct the activities that&#13;most significantly impact Strike and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Strike. Therefore

 2014

 Bacolod Blue Star Export Corp. (&amp;#8220;Bacolod&amp;#8221;)
&#13;Bicol Blue Star Export Co. (&amp;#8220;Bicol&amp;#8221;) and John Keeler Real Estate Holding (&amp;#8220;JK Real Estate&amp;#8221;)
 in light of&#13;ASC 810. The Company purchased inventory from Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company&#13;purchased inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate

 Bacolod&#13;and Bicol have other customers besides the Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&amp;#8217;s customer
 they would&#13;be able to sustain their operations from selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company concluded that Bacolod&#13;and Bicol are not VIE&amp;#8217;s and the Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary

&#13;JK Real Estate&amp;#8217;s equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance its activities without subordinated&#13;financial support. Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted on behalf of the Company&amp;#8217;s stockholder.&#13;The Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate since the Company does not have the power to direct&#13;the activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore



 2018 the Company&#13;adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-18
 &amp;#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-18&amp;#8221;)&lt;i&gt;

 and will be cleared and applied to the line of credit. The Company has no access to this account
 and the purpose of&#13;the funds is restricted to repayment of the line of credit. As of December 31
 2018 and 2017 restricted cash was approximately&#13;$334
500 and $29



 2018 and 2017
 the Company recorded sales return and allowances and refund liability of approximately $159
500 and $155
000
&#13;respectively. There was no allowance for bad debt recorded during the years ended December 31

300 for the years ended December 31
 2018&#13;and December 31
 2017
 this represents a reduction of approximately $88
600 from the year ending December 31


&#13;the Company may advance payments to its suppliers
 inclusive of Bacolod
 a related party. These advances are in the form of prepayments&#13;for products that will ship within a short window of time. In the event that it becomes necessary for the Company to return products&#13;or adjust for quality issues

 2018 and&#13;2017
 the balance due from the related party for future shipments was approximately $1

 &lt;i&gt;Comprehensive Income&lt;/i&gt;


 2018 and 2017 were 1.336 and 1.289 US dollar to UK pound&#13;sterling
 respectively. The resulting net translation gains and losses are reported as foreign currency translation adjustments&#13;in stockholders&amp;#8217; equity as a component of comprehensive (loss) income. The Company recorded foreign currency translation&#13;adjustment of approximately ($38
600) and $56

&amp;#8221; and the associated ASUs (collectively
&#13;&amp;#8220;Topic 606&amp;#8221;)
 the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an&#13;amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine&#13;revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company performs the&#13;following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (3)&#13;determine the transaction price

 thereby reducing the amount of revenue recognized

 the Company&amp;#8217;s accounting policy was to recognize revenue when the products were shipped
 the risks of ownership&#13;transferred to the customer and collectability was reasonably assured. Revenue was stated net of sales returns and allowances.&#13;The incentives for sales discounts and promotions the Company offers to its customers were accounted for as a reduction of revenue&#13;when they were characterized as cash consideration
 in accordance with ASC 605

 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact&#13;on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the company entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement with a supplier that the company was engaged&#13;in a commercial dispute. The settlement resulted in a reduction of the outstanding accounts payable to that supplier of $388

 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]








    
    



 Florida
 Blue
Star Foods Corp. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a sustainable seafood company. The company&#8217;s main operating business
 John
Keeler &#38; Co.
 Inc. has been in business for approximately twenty-one years. The Company was formed under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The current source of revenue is importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Indonesia
 Philippines and
China and distributing it in the United States of America
 Canada and Europe under several brand names such as Blue Star
 Oceanica
Pacifika and Harbor Banks.


 2018 the sole
shareholder of John Keeler &#38; Co.
 Inc. executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with Blue Star Foods Corp.
(Formerly A.G. Acquisition Group II
 Inc.) and Blue Star Acquisition Corp. John R. Keeler exchanged his 500 shares with a par value
of $1.00 in John Keeler &#38; Co.
 Inc. for the 15
000
000 shares with a par value of $.0001 of the then outstanding 16
015
000
outstanding shares. As part of the merger
 the net liabilities existing in the company as of the date of the merger totaling approximately
$2
400 were converted to equity as part of this transaction. The prior owners of Blue Star Foods Corp. received 750
000 shares
of common stock as part of this transaction
 and various service providers received 265
000 shares as compensation for their work
on the transaction resulting in and expense and additional paid in capital of $530
001. Additionally
 there were 725 Series A Preferred
shares and 181
250 warrants issued to private placement investors for total capital contribution of $725
000
 688 Series A Preferred
shares and 172
000 warrants issued for settlement with prior investors which had a fair value of $688
000 and $81
353 respectively.
Lastly
 upon the close of the merger there were 3
120
000 options to purchase common stock issued to Christopher Constable. Additionally
Carlos Faria held options to purchase 104 shares of John Keeler &#38; Co.
 Inc. prior to the merger. These options were immediately
converted at closing to 3
120
000 options to purchase common stock in Blue Star Foods Corp.

The
Merger was accounted for as a &#8220;reverse merger&#8221; and recapitalization since
 immediately following the completion of
the transaction
 the holders of John Keeler &#38; Co.
 Inc.&#8217;s stock will have effective control of Blue Star Foods Corp.
In addition
 John Keeler &#38; Co.
 Inc. will have control of the combined entity through control of the Board by designating
all four of the board seats. Additionally

 Inc.&#8217;s officers and senior executive positions
will continue on as management of the combined entity after consummation of the Merger. For accounting purposes

 Inc.&#8217;s assets
 liabilities and results
of operations are the historical financial statements of the registrant

include the accounts of the Company
 John Keeler &#38; Co
 a wholly owned subsidiary
 and its variable interest entity for which
the John Keeler &#38; Co. the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.




Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standard Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 810
 
 when a reporting entity
is the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;)
 as defined in ASC 810
 the VIE
must be consolidated into the financial statements of the reporting entity. The determination of which owner is the primary beneficiary
of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights
 obligations
 and economic interests
of each interest holder in the VIE.


in VIE&#8217;s on an ongoing basis and consolidates any VIE in which it has a controlling financial interest and is deemed to be
the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the
activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the
VIE that could potentially be significant to it or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the
VIE.


 2014
 the
Company&#8217;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. (&#8220;Strike&#8221;)
 a related
party entity which holds the Company&#8217;s inventory on consignment in United Kingdom (see Note 3). The Company evaluated its
interest in Strike and determined that Strike is a VIE due to the Company&#8217;s implicit interest in Strike and the fact that
Strike and the Company were under common control after the transfer of the controlling interest. Moreover
 the Company determined
that it is the primary beneficiary of Strike due to the fact that the Company had both the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact Strike and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Strike. Therefore
 the
Company consolidated Strike in its financial statements.


reflected in the Company&#8217;s financial statements starting on April 1
 2014
 the effective date of the controlling interest
transfer. Strike&#8217;s equity is classified as non-controlling interest in the Company&#8217;s financial statements since the
Company is not a shareholder of Strike. Strike was not a VIE of the Company and the Company was not the primary beneficiary of
Strike prior to the controlling interest transfer.


interest in three related party entities that are under common control with the Company
 Bacolod Blue Star Export Corp. (&#8220;Bacolod&#8221;)
Bicol Blue Star Export Co. (&#8220;Bicol&#8221;) and John Keeler Real Estate Holding (&#8220;JK Real Estate&#8221;)
 in light of
ASC 810. The Company purchased inventory from Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company
purchased inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate
 a landlord
that is a related party through common family beneficial ownership (see Note 7).


Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&#8217;s as they do not meet the criteria to be considered a VIE per ASC 810. The Company does not
directly or indirectly absorb any variability of Bacolod or Bicol. The relationship between the Company and Bacolod and Bicol is
 accounting policy). Moreover
 Bacolod
and Bicol have other customers besides the Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&#8217;s customer
 they would
be able to sustain their operations from selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company concluded that Bacolod
and Bicol are not VIE&#8217;s and the Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary
 Bacolod or Bicol is not consolidated with
the Company&#8217;s financial statements.


JK Real Estate is a VIE due the fact that the Company guarantees the mortgage on the facility rented from JK Real Estate. Therefore
JK Real Estate&#8217;s equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance its activities without subordinated
financial support. Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted on behalf of the Company&#8217;s stockholder.
The Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate since the Company does not have the power to direct
the activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK Real Estate is not consolidated with the Company&#8217;s
financial statements.

 the Company is issued a credit by the vendor in the normal course of business and these credits are
also reflected against future shipments.

other than the U.S. Dollar. They are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period.
The VIE&#8217;s revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average rates that prevailed during the period. The
rates used in the financial statements as presented for December 31
 2018 and 2017 were 1.336 and 1.289 US dollar to UK pound sterling

2018 adoption of ASU 2014-09
 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&#8221; and the associated ASUs (collectively
&#8220;Topic 606&#8221;)
 the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an
amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine
revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company performs the
following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (3)
determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

a reduction of the arrangement&#8217;s transaction price
 thereby reducing the amount of revenue recognized
 unless the payment
is for distinct goods or services received from the customer.


of Topic 606
 the Company&#8217;s accounting policy was to recognize revenue when the products were shipped
 the risks of ownership
transferred to the customer and collectability was reasonably assured. Revenue was stated net of sales returns and allowances.
The incentives for sales discounts and promotions the Company offers to its customers were accounted for as a reduction of revenue
when they were characterized as cash consideration
 in accordance with ASC 605
 Revenue Recognition. Otherwise
 the incentives
were expensed.

 2018 and 2017
 respectively.




statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




Company had three customers which accounted for approximately 65% and 63%
 of revenue during the years ended December 31
 2018
and 2017
 respectively. Outstanding receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 65% and 66% of the total accounts
receivable as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact
on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial position.




Company had three suppliers which accounted for approximately 87% of the Company&#8217;s total purchases during the year ended
December 31
 2018. These three suppliers are located in two countries
 Indonesia
 and the Philippines
 which accounted for approximately
93% of the Company&#8217;s total purchases during the year ended December 31
 2018.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments


financial instruments include cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 and debt obligations. We believe the
carrying values of our financial instruments approximate their fair values because they are short term in nature or payable on
demand.

Earnings
or Loss per Share:


Company accounts for earnings per share pursuant to ASC 260
 Earnings per Share
 which requires disclosure on the financial statements
of &#8220;basic&#8221; and &#8220;diluted&#8221; earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing
net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents
(if dilutive) related to stock options and warrants for each year. As further described in Footnote 6 - Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock
 as of December 31
 2018
 1
413 shares of Preferred Stock could be converted into 706
500 shares of common stock. As further
described in Footnote 7 &#8211; Options &#38; Warrants
 as of December 31
 2018
 6
240
000 options may be exercised and 353
250
Warrants are eligible for exercise. There were no Preferred Stock
 Warrants or Options outstanding as of December 31
 2017


there was a net loss for the years ended December 31
 2018
 basic and diluted losses per share are the same.




compensation in accordance with ASC 718
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#8221;. ASC 718 requires companies to measure the
cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
 including stock options
 based on the grant-date
fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service
in exchange for the award
 usually the vesting period. The Company has elected to adopt ASU 2016-09 and has a policy to account
for forfeitures as they occur.

Non-Employee Stock-Based
Compensation:


compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505-50
 &#8220;Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees
&#8221; which requires
that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation
is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest.




party transactions in accordance with ASC 850 (&#8220;Related Party Disclosures&#8221;). A party is considered to be related to
the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries
 controls
 is controlled by
 or is under
common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company
 its management
 members of the immediate
families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls
or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or
operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly
influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
interests is also a related party.


 2018 and
2017
 there was $174

amounts in prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.




policies:


to November 8
 2018
 the Company was taxed under the provisions of subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these provisions
the Company did not pay corporate federal income taxes on its taxable income but was liable for Florida corporate income taxes
and Texas Franchise Tax. The shareholder was liable for individual income taxes on the Company&#8217;s taxable income. Post-merger
the Company file consolidated federal and state income tax returns.


pro forma amounts for income tax expense have been presented assuming the Company&#8217;s pro forma effective tax rate of (2.56)%
for the year ended December 31
 2018
 and 68.09 % for the year ended December 31
 2017 as if it had been a C corporation during
those periods. The pro-forma provision for income taxes excludes information related to the Company&#8217;s VIE.


tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases
of assets and liabilities
 computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance
 if needed
 reduces deferred tax assets to the
amount expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through
the provision for income taxes.


position is recognized as a benefit only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the tax position would be sustained in
a tax examination
 with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that
is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221;
test
 no tax benefit is recorded.


Company&#8217;s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in &#8220;Income tax expense&#8221; in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no amounts related to interest and penalties recognized for the years ended
December 31
 2018 or 2017.




 the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU 2014-09
 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221;
 and has
subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASUs (collectively
 &#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). ASC 606 prescribes a single
common revenue standard that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 is intended to provide a more
consistent interpretation and application of the principles outlined in the standard across filers in multiple industries and within
the same industries compared to current practices
 which should improve comparability. Adoption of ASC 606 is required for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Upon adoption
 we must elect to adopt either retrospectively to each prior
reporting period presented or use the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized
at the date of initial application. We adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective method on January 1
 2018.


 an entity
recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services
 in an amount that reflects the consideration
which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements
that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606
 the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s)
with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies
a performance obligation. ASC 606 also impacts certain other areas
 such as the accounting for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
The standard also requires disclosure of the nature

standard using the 5-step process prescribed by ASC 606. We reviewed all of our contracts

 &#8220;Leases&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2016-02&#8221;)

 Leases&#8221; and ASU 2018-11
 &#8220;Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements.&#8221;
Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&#8217;s
obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset
 which is an asset
that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance
is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities
should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance.


to be adopted using the modified retrospective approach. However
 in July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
 which allows for retrospective
application with the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of
adoption. Under this option
 entities would not need to apply ASC 842 (along with its disclosure requirements) to the comparative
prior periods presented.


most of its operating leases (primarily warehouse space) will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right of use assets
on its consolidated balance sheet. The Company has elected to adopt certain of the optional practical expedients
 including the
package of practical expedients
 which
 among other things
 gives the option to not reassess: 1) whether expired or existing contracts
are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for expired or existing leases; and 3) initial direct costs for existing leases.

 US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting

 deferred
tax assets will not be recognized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered
 including the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities

financial statements. The Company&#8217;s policy is to classify assessments
 if any

No interest or penalties were recorded during the years ended December 31

 when a reporting entity
is the primary beneficiary of an entity that is a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;)
 as defined in ASC 810

of a VIE requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about the rights

in VIE&#8217;s on an ongoing basis and consolidates any VIE in which it has a controlling financial interest and is deemed to be
the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the
activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the
VIE that could potentially be significant to it or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the
VIE.

 the
Company&#8217;s stockholder was transferred the controlling interest of Strike the Gold Foods
 Ltd. (&#8220;Strike&#8221;)
 a related
party entity which holds the Company&#8217;s inventory on consignment in United Kingdom (see Note 3). The Company evaluated its
interest in Strike and determined that Strike is a VIE due to the Company&#8217;s implicit interest in Strike and the fact that
Strike and the Company were under common control after the transfer of the controlling interest. Moreover
 the Company determined
that it is the primary beneficiary of Strike due to the fact that the Company had both the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact Strike and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Strike. Therefore
 the
Company consolidated Strike in its financial statements.

 2014
 the effective date of the controlling interest
transfer. Strike&#8217;s equity is classified as non-controlling interest in the Company&#8217;s financial statements since the
Company is not a shareholder of Strike. Strike was not a VIE of the Company and the Company was not the primary beneficiary of
Strike prior to the controlling interest transfer.

 Bacolod Blue Star Export Corp. (&#8220;Bacolod&#8221;)
Bicol Blue Star Export Co. (&#8220;Bicol&#8221;) and John Keeler Real Estate Holding (&#8220;JK Real Estate&#8221;)
 in light of
ASC 810. The Company purchased inventory from Bacolod
 an exporter of pasteurized crab meat out of the Philippines. The Company
purchased inventory
 via Bacolod
 from Bicol. The Company leases its office and warehouse facility from JK Real Estate
 a landlord
that is a related party through common family beneficial ownership (see Note 7).


Bacolod and Bicol are not VIE&#8217;s as they do not meet the criteria to be considered a VIE per ASC 810. The Company does not
directly or indirectly absorb any variability of Bacolod or Bicol. The relationship between the Company and Bacolod and Bicol is
 accounting policy). Moreover
 Bacolod
and Bicol have other customers besides the Company. Even if the Company is no longer Bacolod or Bicol&#8217;s customer
 they would
be able to sustain their operations from selling their inventory to their other customers. As the Company concluded that Bacolod
and Bicol are not VIE&#8217;s and the Company is not deemed their primary beneficiary
 Bacolod or Bicol is not consolidated with
the Company&#8217;s financial statements.


JK Real Estate is a VIE due the fact that the Company guarantees the mortgage on the facility rented from JK Real Estate. Therefore
JK Real Estate&#8217;s equity at risk is not deemed sufficient to permit JK Real Estate to finance its activities without subordinated
financial support. Moreover
 the activities of JK Real Estate are substantially conducted on behalf of the Company&#8217;s stockholder.
The Company concluded that it not the primary beneficiary of JK Real Estate since the Company does not have the power to direct
the activities that most significantly impact JK Real Estate. Therefore
 JK Real Estate is not consolidated with the Company&#8217;s
financial statements.

 the Company is issued a credit by the vendor in the normal course of business and these credits are
also reflected against future shipments.


 2018 and
2017
 the balance due from the related party for future shipments was approximately $1

other than the U.S. Dollar. They are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period.
The VIE&#8217;s revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average rates that prevailed during the period. The
rates used in the financial statements as presented for December 31
 2018 and 2017 were 1.336 and 1.289 US dollar to UK pound

2018 adoption of ASU 2014-09
 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&#8221; and the associated ASUs (collectively
&#8220;Topic 606&#8221;)
 the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an
amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine
revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company performs the
following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (3)
determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.


policy to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities. Consideration payable to a customer is recorded as
a reduction of the arrangement&#8217;s transaction price
 thereby reducing the amount of revenue recognized
 unless the payment
is for distinct goods or services received from the customer.


of Topic 606
 the Company&#8217;s accounting policy was to recognize revenue when the products were shipped
 the risks of ownership
transferred to the customer and collectability was reasonably assured. Revenue was stated net of sales returns and allowances.
The incentives for sales discounts and promotions the Company offers to its customers were accounted for as a reduction of revenue
when they were characterized as cash consideration
 in accordance with ASC 605
 Revenue Recognition. Otherwise
 the incentives
were expensed.








of advertising as incurred. Advertising expenses which are included in Other Operating Expenses were approximately $127
000 and
$108
000
 for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.








statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.








Company had three customers which accounted for approximately 65% and 63%
 of revenue during the years ended December 31
 2018
and 2017
 respectively. Outstanding receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 65% and 66% of the total accounts
receivable as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact
on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial position.








Company had three suppliers which accounted for approximately 87% of the Company&#8217;s total purchases during the year ended
December 31
 2018. These three suppliers are located in two countries
 Indonesia
 and the Philippines
 which accounted for approximately
93% of the Company&#8217;s total purchases during the year ended December 31
 2018.


Company had three suppliers which accounted for approximately 75% of the Company&#8217;s total purchases during the year ended
December 31
 2017. These three suppliers are located in three countries
 Indonesia
 Philippines
 and China
 which accounted for
approximately 93% of the Company&#8217;s total purchases during the year ended December 31
 2017.


suppliers included Bacolod
 a related party
 which accounted for approximately 49% and 53% of the Company&#8217;s total purchases
during the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.


September 20
 2018
 the company entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement with a supplier that the company was engaged
in a commercial dispute. The settlement resulted in a reduction of the outstanding accounts payable to that supplier of $388
199
to a balance due of $1
465
000. The balance due to this supplier as of December 31
 2018 was approximately $1
297
800.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments


financial instruments include cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 and debt obligations. We believe
the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate their fair values because they are short term in nature or payable
on demand.





Earnings
or Loss per Share:


accounts for earnings per share pursuant to ASC 260
 Earnings per Share
 which requires disclosure on the financial statements
of &#8220;basic&#8221; and &#8220;diluted&#8221; earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing
net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents
(if dilutive) related to stock options and warrants for each year. As further described in Footnote 6 - Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock
 as of December 31
 2018
 1
413 shares of Preferred Stock could be converted into 706
500 shares of common stock. As further
described in Footnote 7 &#8211; Options &#38; Warrants
 as of December 31
 2018

Warrants are eligible for exercise. There were no Preferred Stock
 Warrants or Options outstanding as of December 31
 2017


was a net loss for the years ended December 31
 2018
 basic and diluted losses per share are the same.








compensation in accordance with ASC 718
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#8221;. ASC 718 requires companies to measure
the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
 including stock options
 based on the grant-date
fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service
in exchange for the award
 usually the vesting period. The Company has elected to adopt ASU 2016-09 and has a policy to account
for forfeitures as they occur.








compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505-50
 &#8220;Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees
&#8221; which requires
that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation
is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest.








transactions in accordance with ASC 850 (&#8220;Related Party Disclosures&#8221;). A party is considered to be related to the Company
if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries
 controls
 is controlled by
 or is under common control
with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company
 its management
 members of the immediate families
of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or
operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly
influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
interests is also a related party.


 2018 and 2017
there was $174
600 and $162
300 in interest paid to related parties on subordinated notes payable. See Note 6 Stockholder Notes
Payable and Note 4 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity for further information.

policies:


to November 8
 2018
 the Company was taxed under the provisions of subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these provisions
the Company did not pay corporate federal income taxes on its taxable income but was liable for Florida corporate income taxes
and Texas Franchise Tax. The shareholder was liable for individual income taxes on the Company&#8217;s taxable income. Post-merger
the Company file consolidated federal and state income tax returns.


pro forma amounts for income tax expense have been presented assuming the Company&#8217;s pro forma effective tax rate of (2.56)%
for the year ended December 31
 2018
 and 68.09 % for the year ended December 31
 2017 as if it had been a C corporation during
those periods. The pro-forma provision for income taxes excludes information related to the Company&#8217;s VIE.


tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases
of assets and liabilities
 computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance
 if needed
 reduces deferred tax assets to the
amount expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through
the provision for income taxes.


position is recognized as a benefit only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the tax position would be sustained in
a tax examination
 with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that
is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221;
test
 no tax benefit is recorded.


Company&#8217;s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in &#8220;Income tax expense&#8221; in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no amounts related to interest and penalties recognized for the years ended
December 31
 2018 or 2017.








 the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU 2014-09
 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221;
 and has
subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASUs (collectively
 &#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). ASC 606 prescribes a single
common revenue standard that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 is intended to provide a more
consistent interpretation and application of the principles outlined in the standard across filers in multiple industries and within
the same industries compared to current practices
 which should improve comparability. Adoption of ASC 606 is required for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Upon adoption
 we must elect to adopt either retrospectively to each prior
reporting period presented or use the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized
at the date of initial application. We adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective method on January 1
 2018.


 an entity
recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services
 in an amount that reflects the consideration
which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements
that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606
 the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s)
with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies
a performance obligation. ASC 606 also impacts certain other areas
 such as the accounting for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.
The standard also requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers.


recognition policy specific to all revenue streams governing product sales and have come to conclusions on the impact of the new
standard using the 5-step process prescribed by ASC 606. We reviewed all of our contracts
 and determined the potential impact
to our accounting policies
 financial controls and operations. Our conclusions include recognizing revenue on product sales once
the product is sold to the distributor or retail customers.


 we used
the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard. This means that we did not restate previously issued financial statements
but we recorded a one-time adjustment to retained earnings of ($81
520). This adjustment represents the sales of our product to
our customers prior to January 1
 2018
 that had not been delivered or in control of the customer.


the changes made to our consolidated January 1
 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of ASC 606 was as follows:

 we recognized revenue
on product sales once the product left the company&#8217;s warehouse. Effective January 1
 2018
 we began recognizing revenue when
our customers
 take control of our product be it a shipment or upon delivery. This will have the impact of us recognizing revenue
approximately seven calendar days later than before adopting the new standard. The following financial statement line items for
twelve months ended December 31

 the FASB
issued new lease accounting guidance ASU No. 2016-02
 &#8220;Leases&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2016-02&#8221;)

&#8220;Codification Improvements to Topic 842
 Leases&#8221; and ASU 2018-11
 &#8220;Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements.&#8221;
Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&#8217;s
obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset
 which is an asset
that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance
is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities
should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance.


to be adopted using the modified retrospective approach. However
 in July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
 which allows for retrospective
application with the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of
adoption. Under this option
 entities would not need to apply ASC 842 (along with its disclosure requirements) to the comparative
prior periods presented.


most of its operating leases (primarily warehouse space) will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right of use assets
on its consolidated balance sheet. The Company has elected to adopt certain of the optional practical expedients
 including the
package of practical expedients
 which
 among other things
 gives the option to not reassess: 1) whether expired or existing contracts
are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for expired or existing leases; and 3) initial direct costs for existing leases.

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.

Expected Volatility
 Minimum




Expected Volatility
 Maximum

































The estimated measure of the maximum percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
