 the different cycles are somewhat offsetting. Minimal food packaging occurs in the Company's last fiscal quarter ending March 31
 which is the optimal time for maintenance
 repairs and equipment changes in its packaging plants. The supply of commodities
 current pricing
 and expected new crop quantity and quality affect the timing and amount of the Company&#8217;s sales and earnings. When the seasonal harvesting periods of the Company's major fruits and vegetables are newly completed
 inventories for these packaged fruits and vegetables are at their highest levels. For peas
 the peak inventory time is mid-summer and for corn
 the Company's highest volume vegetable
 the peak inventory is in mid-autumn. For pears and cherries
 the peak inventory is late-summer.

 an end of year sales order backlog is not considered meaningful. Traditionally
 larger customers provide tentative bookings for their expected purchases for the upcoming season. These bookings are further developed as data on the expected size of the related national harvests becomes available. In general
 these bookings serve as a yardstick rather than as a firm commitment
 since actual harvest results can vary notably from early estimates. In actual practice
 the Company has substantially all of its expected seasonal production identified to potential sales outlets before the seasonal production is completed.




 quality
 service
 and pricing being the major determinants in the Company&#8217;s relative market position. The Company believes that it is a major producer of canned fruits and vegetables
 but some producers of canned
 frozen and other forms of fruit and vegetable products have sales which exceed the Company's sales. The Company is aware of approximately 14 competitors in the U.S. packaged vegetable industry
 many of which are privately held companies. The Company is aware of approximately nine competitors in the U.S. packaged fruit industry. In addition
 there are significant quantities of fruit that are imported from Europe
 Asia
 and South America.


 approximately 11% of the Company&#8217;s packaged foods sales were packed for retail customers under the Company&#8217;s branded labels of Seneca
 
 CherryMan
 Green Valley
. About 20% of packaged foods sales were packed for institutional food distributors and 63% were retail packed under the private label of our customers. The remaining 6% was sold under a Contract Packing Agreement with B&amp;G Foods (the &#8220;Green Giant Agreement&#8221;) (see note 14&nbsp;of Item 8
 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Termination of the Green Giant Agreement would substantially reduce the Company&#8217;s sales and profitability unless the Company was to enter into a new substantial supply relationship with Green Giant or another major vegetable marketer. The non-Green Giant customers represent a full cross section of the retail
 institutional
 distributor
 and industrial markets; and the Company does not consider itself dependent on any single sales source other than sales attributable to the Green Giant Agreement.


 which rate among the top three national brands according to a leading market research firm.














 the Company has cooperated with federal
 state
 and local environmental protection authorities in developing and maintaining suitable antipollution facilities. In general
 we believe our pollution control facilities are equal to or somewhat superior to those of our competitors and are within environmental protection standards. The Company does not expect any material capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations in the near future.


 national and international regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. In the United States
 there is a significant possibility that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level to address the effects of climate change. Such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes
 the restriction of output
 investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations
 or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.




 the Company is made a party to certain legal proceedings seeking monetary damages
 including proceedings involving product liability claims
 worker&#8217;s compensation and other employee claims
 tort and other general liability claims
 for which it carries insurance as well as patent infringement and related litigation. The Company is in a highly regulated industry and is also periodically involved in government actions for regulatory violations and other matters surrounding the manufacturing of its products
 including
 but not limited to
 environmental
 employee
 and product safety issues. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters
 the Company does not believe that an adverse decision in any of these legal proceedings would have a material adverse impact on its financial position

 or cash flows.




 the Company had approximately 3
700 employees of which 3
300 full time and 400 seasonal employees work in food packaging and 100 full time employees work in other activities. The number of employees increases to&nbsp;approximately 7

 could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position
 results of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations or financial results. The Company refers to itself as &#8220;we&#8221;
 &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; in this section.






 with that; less shelf space is being devoted to these categories in the supermarkets. Fresh and perishable businesses are improving their delivery systems around the world and the availability of fresh produce is impacting the consumers purchasing patterns relating to processed fruits and vegetables. Our financial performance and growth are related to conditions in the United States&#8217; fruit and vegetable packaging industry which is a mature industry with a modest growth rate during the last 10 years. Our net sales are a function of product availability and market pricing. In the fruit and vegetable packaging industry
 product availability and market prices tend to have an inverse relationship: market prices tend to decrease as more product is available and to increase if less product is available. Product availability is a direct result of plantings
 growing conditions
 crop yields and inventory levels
 all of which vary from year to year. Moreover
 fruit and vegetable production outside the United States
 particularly in Europe
 Asia and South America
 is increasing at a time when worldwide demand for certain products
&nbsp;is being impacted by the global economic slowdown. These factors may have a significant effect on supply and competition and create downward pressure on prices. In addition
 market prices can be affected by the planting and inventory levels and individual pricing decisions of our competitors. Generally
 market prices in the fruit and vegetable packaging industry adjust more quickly to variations in product availability than an individual packager can adjust its cost structure; thus
 in an oversupply situation
 a packager&#8217;s margins likely will weaken. We typically have experienced lower margins during times of industry oversupply.


 the fruit and vegetable packaging industry has been characterized by excess capacity
 with resulting pressure on our prices and profit margins. We have closed packaging plants in past years in response to the downward pressure on prices. There can be no assurance that our margins will improve in response to favorable market conditions or that we will be able to operate profitably during depressed market conditions.




 we must harvest and package them quickly or forego the opportunity to package fresh picked fruits and vegetables for an entire year. Most of our fruits and vegetables are grown by farmers under contract with us. Consequently
 we must pay the contract grower for the fruits and vegetables even if we cannot or do not harvest or package them. Most of our production occurs during the second quarter (July through September) of our fiscal year
 which corresponds with the quarter that the growing season ends for most of the produce packaged by us. A majority of our sales occur during the second&nbsp;and third&nbsp;quarters of each fiscal year due to seasonal consumption patterns for our products. Accordingly
 inventory levels are highest during the second and third quarters
 and accounts receivable levels are highest during the third and fourth quarters. Net sales generated during our third and fourth fiscal quarters have a significant impact on our results of operations. Because of these seasonal fluctuations
 the results of any particular quarter
 particularly in the first half of our fiscal year
 will not necessarily be indicative of results for the full year or for future years.


 this somewhat reduces the risk that our entire crop will be subject to disastrous weather. The upper Midwest is the primary growing region for the principal vegetables which we pack
 namely peas
 green beans and corn
 and it is also a substantial source of our competitors&#8217; vegetable production. The adverse effects of weather-related reduced production may be partially mitigated by higher selling prices for the fruits and vegetables which are produced.




 such as fruits and vegetables
 steel (used to make cans)
 ingredients
 pouches and other packaging materials as well as the electricity and natural gas used in our business
 are commodities that may experience price volatility caused by external factors
 including market fluctuations
 availability
 currency fluctuations and changes in governmental regulations and agricultural programs. General inventory positions of major commodities
 such as field corn
 soybeans and wheat
 all commodities with which we must compete for acreage
 can have dramatic effects on prices for those commodities
 which can translate into similar swings in prices needed to be paid for our contracted commodities. These programs and other events can result in reduced supplies of these commodities
 higher supply costs or interruptions in our production schedules. If prices of these commodities increase beyond what we can pass along to our customers
 our operating income will decrease.




 the U.S. Government imposed 25% duties on the importation of steel from most of the steel producing countries around the world. Seneca Foods makes its own cans using tin-plated and tin-free steel purchased from both domestic and off-shore suppliers. The duties will potentially have an impact on the cost of steel that the Company has already committed for but yet not received from off-shore suppliers. In addition
 based on information provided by domestic suppliers
 the cost of steel in the future will substantially increase. This will create higher costs of the primary packaging used by the Company for its products. The ability to pass on these costs to our customers is an unknown risk. In addition
 other countries have or are threatening to impose retaliatory duties on items produced in the U.S. including the Company&#8217;s products. This will limit the export potential for the Company&#8217;s products going forward.












 which includes increased concentration and a growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. Dependence upon key customers could lead to increased pricing pressure by these customers.


 respectively
 of our total sales. Our sales of Green Giant product and financial performance under the Contract Packing Agreement depend to a significant extent on our success in producing quality Green Giant vegetables at competitive costs and B&amp;G Foods success in marketing the products produced by us. The ability of B&amp;G Foods to successfully market these products will depend upon B&amp;G Foods&#8217;s sales efforts as well as the factors described above under &#8220;Excess capacity in the fruit and vegetable industry has a downward impact on selling price.&#8221; We cannot give assurance as to the volume of B&amp;G Foods&#8217;s sales and cannot control many of the key factors affecting that volume.


 purchases by the United Sates Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) in fiscal year 2019 represented approximately 2.1% of our total sales. The purchase of our products by the USDA is done through the government&#8217;s competitive bid process. We bid on stated product requirements and needs as presented by the USDA and
 if we are the successful bidder
 we fulfill the contract and deliver the product. The government contracting process is complex and subject to numerous regulations and requirements. Failure by us to comply with the regulations and requirements for government contracts could jeopardize our ability to contract with the government and could result in reduced sales or prohibition on submitting bids to the USDA. The government procurement process could also change and result in our inability to meet the new requirements. Additionally
 the government&#8217;s need for our products could decrease
 which would result in reduced sales to the USDA.


 our business
 financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

If we do not maintain the market shares of our products
 our business and revenues may be adversely affected. 


 but also compete with products we produce and sell to other companies who market those products under their own brand names
 such as the Green Giant vegetables we sell to B&amp;G Foods under the Contract Packing Agreement and the fruits and vegetables we sell to various retail grocery chains which carry our customer&#8217;s own brand names.&nbsp;


 many major retail food chains have been increasing their promotions
 offerings and shelf space allocations for their own fruit and vegetable brands
 to the detriment of fruit and vegetable brands owned by the packagers
 including our own brands. We cannot predict the pricing or promotional activities of our customers/competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us. There are competitive pressures and other factors
 which could cause our products to lose market share or result in significant price erosion that could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.




 intermodal
 rail cars
 and ships. Disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason
 including availability or cost of fuel
 regulations affecting the industry
 or labor shortages in the transportation industry
 could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers
 and could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

If we are subject to product liability claims
 we may incur significant and unexpected costs and our business reputation could be adversely affected. 


 the industry and suppliers to stay abreast of developments. A product liability judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures
 affect consumer confidence in our products
 and divert management&#8217;s attention from other responsibilities. Product liability claims may also lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. Although we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance coverage
 there can be no assurance that this level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost
 if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

We are increasingly dependent on information technology; disruptions
 failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our operations.


 manage and process
 and may incur legal costs if our information security policies and procedures are not effective or if we are required to defend our methods of collection
 processing and storage of&nbsp;data. Future investigations
 lawsuits or adverse publicity relating to our methods of handling&nbsp;data could adversely affect our business
 results of operations
 financial condition and cash flows due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such developments.


 including costs to hire additional personnel
 purchase additional protection technologies
 train employees
 and engage third-party experts and consultants. In addition
 data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues
 including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of&nbsp;confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in violation of applicable privacy and other laws
 significant legal and financial exposure
 and a loss of confidence in our security measures
 which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.




 we regularly dispose of produce wastes (silage) and processing water as well as materials used in plant operation and maintenance
 and our plant boilers
 which generate heat used in packaging
 produce generally small emissions into the air. These activities and operations are regulated by federal and state laws and the respective federal and state environmental agencies. Occasionally
 we may be required to remediate conditions found by the regulators to be in violation of environmental law or to contribute to the cost of remediating waste disposal sites
 which we neither owned nor operated
 but in which
 we and other companies deposited waste materials
 usually through independent waste disposal companies. Future possible costs of environmental remediation
 contributions and penalties could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.







Our production capacity for certain products and commodities is concentrated in a limited number of facilities
 exposing us to a material disruption in production in the event that a disaster strikes.


 one with substantially more capacity than the other
 which are not interchangeable since each plant cannot necessarily produce all the can sizes needed. Although we maintain property and business interruption insurance coverage
 there can be no assurance that this level of coverage is adequate in the event of a catastrophe or significant disruption at these or other Company facilities. If such an event occurs
 it could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.




 we may undertake acquisitions of other businesses or introduce new products
 although there can be no assurances that these will occur. Such undertakings involve numerous risks and significant investments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire acquisition candidates on favorable terms
 to profitably manage or to successfully integrate future businesses that we&nbsp;may acquire or new products we may introduce without substantial costs
 delays or problems. Any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.




 we had approximately 3
700 employees of which 3
300 full time and 400 seasonal employees worked in food packaging and 100 employees worked in other activities. During the peak summer harvest period
 we hire up to approximately 7
000 seasonal employees to help package fruits and vegetables. If there is an increase to minimum wage rates
 this could have a negative impact on our costs of operations. Many of our packaging operations are located in rural communities that may not have sufficient labor pools
 requiring us to hire employees from other regions. An inability to hire and train sufficient employees during the critical harvest period could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.




 in collaboration with other can makers as well as enamel suppliers
 has decided to aggressively work to find alternative materials for can linings not manufactured using BPA. However
 commercially acceptable alternatives are not immediately available for some applications and there can be no assurance that these steps will be successful. Less than 1% of our canned product volume (excluding B&amp;G Foods and purchased canned products) still includes BPA.




 mandatory recall authority of the FDA
 increased scrutiny of foreign sourced or supplied food products
 and increased records access may have an impact on our business. As we are already in a highly regulated business
 operating under the increased scrutiny of more FDA authority does not appear likely to negatively impact our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;The law also gives FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods.




 along with its other marketplace initiatives
 are designed to capitalize on new customer or consumer trends.&nbsp; The FDA recently issued a statement on sodium which referred to an Institute of Medicine statement that too much sodium is a major contributor to high blood pressure. Some of our products contain a moderate amount of sodium per recommended serving
 which is based on consumer&#8217;s preferences for taste. &nbsp;In order to remain successful
 the Company must anticipate and react to these new trends and develop new products or packages to address them. While the Company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal
 we may not be successful in developing new products or packages
 or our new products or packages may not be accepted by customers or consumers.










 2012
 the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals
 known as conflict minerals
 that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by companies filing public reports. The rule
 which requires a disclosure report to be filed by May 31 each year
 requires companies to perform country of origin inquiries
 due diligence as required
 disclosure
 and reporting whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.&nbsp; The conflict mineral rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals
 including
 tin
 which is used primarily in the manufacture of our cans. The number of suppliers
 who provide conflict-free minerals in steel production
 or other components
 may be limited. In addition
 there may be significant costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements
 such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our cans
 as well as costs of possible changes to products
 packages
 or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Since our supply chain is complex
 we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the procedures that we implement
 which may hurt our business. In addition
 we may encounter significant challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free
 which could place us
 as well as our competitors
 at a disadvantage if we are unable to do so.



Global economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.


 including the impact of recessions in the United States and throughout the world
 may negatively affect our business and financial results. These economic conditions could negatively impact (i) consumer demand for our products
 (ii) the mix of our products&#8217; sales
 (iii) our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis
 (iv) the ability of suppliers to provide the materials required in our operations and (v) our ability to obtain financing or to otherwise access the capital markets. The strength of the U.S. dollar versus other world currencies could result in increased competition from imported products and decreased sales to our international customers. A prolonged recession could result in decreased revenue
 margins and earnings. Additionally
 the economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers
 causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.




 2019
 we had approximately $303.9 million of total indebtedness
 including various debt agreements
 capital lease&nbsp;and a $155.3 million outstanding balance on our $400.0 million to $500.0 million revolving credit facility (&#8220;Revolver&#8221;).&nbsp; Scheduled debt service for fiscal 2019 is $6.8 million. During our second and third fiscal quarters
 our operations generally require more cash than is available from operations.&nbsp; In these circumstances
 it is necessary to borrow under our Revolver.&nbsp; Our ability to obtain financing in the future through credit facilities will be affected by several factors
 including our creditworthiness
 our ability to operate in a profitable manner and general market and credit conditions.&nbsp; Significant changes in our business or cash outflows from operations could create a need for additional working capital.&nbsp; An inability to obtain additional working capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us or access the Revolver would materially and adversely affect our operations. Additionally
 if we need to use a portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt
 it will reduce the amount of money we have for operations
 working capital
 capital expenditures
 expansions
 acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities.&nbsp;




 among other things
 limit our ability to borrow money
 including with respect to the refinancing of existing indebtedness. These provisions may limit our ability to conduct our business
 take advantage of business opportunities and respond to changing business
 market and economic conditions. In addition
 they may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer
 if any
 restrictions. Failure to comply with the requirements of our Revolver and debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. We have pledged our accounts receivable
 inventory and the capital stock or other ownership interests that we own in our subsidiaries to secure the credit facility. If a default occurred and was not cured
 secured lenders could foreclose on this collateral.









Our existing shareholders
 if acting together
 may be able to exert control over matters requiring shareholder approval. 


 while holders of our Class&nbsp;A common stock are entitled to one-twentieth of a vote per share. In addition
 holders of our 10% Cumulative Convertible Voting Preferred Stock
 Series A
 our 10% Cumulative Convertible Voting Preferred Stock
 Series B and
 solely with respect to the election of directors
 our 6% Cumulative Voting Preferred Stock
 which we refer to as our voting preferred stock
 are entitled to one vote per share. As of March 31
 2019
 holders of Class B common stock and voting preferred stock held 88.3% of the combined voting power of all shares of capital stock then outstanding and entitled to vote. These shareholders
 if acting together
 would be in a position to control the election of our directors and to effect or prevent certain corporate transactions that require majority or supermajority approval of the combined classes
 including mergers and other business combinations. This may result in us taking corporate actions that you may not consider to be in your best interest and may affect the price of our common stock.


 2019
 our current executive officers and directors beneficially owned 12.4% of our outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock
 50.1% of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock and 53.5% of our voting preferred stock
 or 46.7% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock. This concentration of voting power may inhibit changes in control of the Company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.




 the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These provisions include:



			

			

			
			


		
			
			
			


			

			

			
			


		
			
			
			


			

			

			

 rights
 powers and restrictions as the board of directors may determine;


		
			
			
			


			

			

			
			


		
			
			
			


			

			

			

 in addition to certain restrictions which may apply to &#8220;business combinations&#8221; involving us and an &#8220;interested shareholder&#8221;
 a plan for our merger or consolidation must be approved by two-thirds of the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. See &#8220;Our existing shareholders
 if acting together
 may be able to exert control over matters requiring shareholder approval.&#8221;&nbsp;







 payment of cash dividends on our common stock is not permitted by the terms of our revolving credit facility.






 First-Out (LIFO) method of inventory accounting. As of March 31
 2019
 we had a LIFO reserve of $161.3 million which
 at the U.S. corporate tax rate
 represents approximately $40.3 million of income taxes
 payment of which is delayed to future dates based upon changes in inventory costs. From time-to-time
 discussions regarding changes in U.S. tax laws have included the potential of LIFO being repealed. Should LIFO be repealed
 the $40.3 million of postponed taxes
 plus any future benefit realized prior to the date of repeal
 would likely have to be repaid over some period of time. Repayment of these postponed taxes will reduce the amount of cash that we would have available to fund our operations
 working capital
 capital expenditures
 expansions
 acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities. This could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.




 we operate a wholly owned insurance subsidiary
 Dundee Insurance Company
 Inc. We recognize this subsidiary as an insurance company for federal income tax purposes with respect to our consolidated federal income tax return. In the event the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) were to determine that this subsidiary does not qualify as an insurance company
 we could be required to make accelerated income tax payments to the IRS that we otherwise would have deferred until future periods.

 expansion of the number of production days or hours could increase the output by up to 20% for a season.

 the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2007 Equity Plan&#8221;) was approved by shareholders at the Company&#8217;s annual meeting. The 2007 Equity Plan had an initial 10-year term and authorized the issuance of up to 100
000 shares of either Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock or a combination of the two classes of stock. The 2007 Equity Plan was amended and extended for an additional 10-year term at the Company's 2017 annual meeting. 3

 including the election of directors.&nbsp; Each holder of Class A common stock is entitled to one-twentieth (1/20) of one vote per share on all matters on which shareholders are entitled to vote
 including the election of directors.&nbsp; Cumulative voting is not authorized for the holders of common stock.&nbsp;


 unless the increased authorization does not exceed the number of shares of Class B common stock which must be issued in a proposed stock dividend with respect to Class B common stock and an equivalent stock dividend of Class A common stock will be effected concurrently with respect to Class A common stock.


 Section 804 of the New York Business Corporation Law confers upon the holders of Class A common stock the right to vote as a class on any amendment to our Charter which would (i) exclude or limit the shareholders&#8217; right to vote on any matter
 except as such rights may be limited by voting rights given to new shares then being authorized; (ii) change Class A common stock by (a) reducing the par value
 (b) changing the shares into a different number of the same class or into a different or same number of shares of a different class
 or (c) fixing
 changing or abolishing the designation of Class A common stock or any series thereof or any of the relative rights
 preferences
 and limitations of the shares; or (iii) subordinate their rights by authorizing shares having preferences which would be in any respect superior to their rights.&nbsp; Other provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law would entitle holders of Class A common stock to vote as a separate class for approval of any plan of merger
 consolidation or exchange which would effect any change in Class A common stock described in the preceding sentence.


 the proposal must be approved by a majority of the votes of all outstanding shares of Class A common stock.&nbsp; Consequently
 holders of Class A common stock
 by withholding such approval
 can defeat a proposal notwithstanding that holders of a majority of Class B common stock vote in favor of the proposal.

.&nbsp; Each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is equal in respect to dividends and other distributions in cash
 stock or property except that (i) if declared
 a dividend or distribution in our shares on Class A common stock will be paid only in Class A common stock
 and (ii) if declared
 a dividend or distribution in our shares on Class B common stock will be paid only in Class B common stock.&nbsp; The number of shares so paid as a dividend or distribution on each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock shall be equal
 although the class of the shares so paid shall differ depending upon whether the recipient of the dividend is a holder of Class A common stock or Class B common stock.

.&nbsp; In the event of our merger
 consolidation
 or combination with another entity (whether or not we are the surviving entity) or in the event of our dissolution
 the holders of Class A common stock will be entitled to receive the same per share consideration as the per share consideration
 if any
 received by holders of Class B common stock in that transaction.&nbsp; However
 any shares of common stock that holders of Class A common stock become entitled to receive in the transaction may have terms substantially similar to the Class A common stock themselves.&nbsp; Thus
 the surviving entity in any such transaction could have a dual-class capital structure like ours and could
 upon consummation of the merger or consolidation
 give full voting shares to the holders of Class B common stock and one-twentieth (1/20) voting shares to the holders of Class A common stock.




 the Class A special rights seek to prevent a person who has crossed a certain ownership threshold from gaining control of us by acquiring Class B common stock without buying Class A common stock.&nbsp; If any person acquires more than 15% of the outstanding Class B common stock after August 5
 1995
 referred to herein as the Threshold Date
 and does not acquire after the Threshold Date a percentage of the Class A common stock outstanding at least equal to the percentage of Class B common stock that the person acquired in excess of the 15% threshold
 such person will not be allowed to vote shares of Class B common stock acquired in excess of the 15% threshold.&nbsp; For example
 if a person acquires 20% of the outstanding Class B common stock after the Threshold Date but acquires no Class A common stock
 that person would be unable to vote the 5% of the Class B common stock acquired in excess of the 15% threshold.&nbsp; With respect to persons who owned our common stock on or prior to the Threshold Date
 only shares of Class B common stock acquired after the Threshold Date will be counted in determining whether that shareholder has exceeded the 15% threshold for acquisitions of Class B common stock and only acquisitions of Class A common stock after the Threshold Date will be counted in determining whether that shareholder&#8217;s Class A common stock acquisitions have been at least equal to the acquisition of Class B common stock in excess of the 15% threshold.&nbsp; The inability of the person to vote the excess Class B common stock will continue until such time as a sufficient number of shares of Class A common stock have been acquired by the person to satisfy the requirements of the Class A special rights.


 in cash or in non-cash consideration
 for any Class B common stock acquired within the 60 day periods preceding and following the acquisition of the Class A common stock or (ii) the highest closing market sale price of Class B common stock during the 30 day periods preceding and following the acquisition of the Class A common stock.&nbsp; The value of any non-cash consideration will be determined by our Board of Directors acting in good faith.&nbsp; The highest closing market sale price of a share of Class B common stock will be the highest closing sale price reported by NASDAQ Global Market or on any such other securities exchange then constituting the principal trading market for either class of the common stock.&nbsp; In the event that no quotations are available
 the highest closing market sale price will be the fair market value during the 30 day periods preceding and following the acquisition of a share of Class B common stock as determined by our Board of Directors acting in good faith.&nbsp; The equitable price provision is intended to require a person seeking to acquire control of us to buy the Class B common stock and the Class A common stock at virtually the same time and the same price
 as might occur in a tender offer
 to ensure that the acquiring person would be able to vote the Class B common stock acquired in excess of the 15% threshold.


 an acquisition of Class B common stock is deemed to include any shares that an acquiring person acquires directly or indirectly
 in one transaction or a series of transactions
 or with respect to which that person acts or agrees to act in concert with any other person.&nbsp; As used in the preceding sentence
 &#8220;person&#8221; includes one or more persons and entities who act or agree to act in concert with respect to the acquisition or disposition of Class B common stock or with respect to proposing or effecting a plan or proposal to (a) a merger
 reorganization or liquidation of us or a sale of a material amount of our assets
 (b) a change in our Board of Directors or management
 including any plan or proposal to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors or change the number or term of Directors
&nbsp; (c) a material change in our business or corporate structure
 or (d) any material change in our capitalization or dividend policy.&nbsp; Unless there are affirmative attributes of concerted action
 however
 &#8220;acting or agreeing to act in concert with any other person&#8221; does not include acts or agreements to act by persons pursuant to their official capacities as directors or officers of us or because they are related by blood or marriage.


 the following acquisitions and increases are excluded:&nbsp; (i) shares of Class B common stock held by any person on the Threshold Date
 (ii) an increase in a holder&#8217;s percentage ownership of Class B common stock resulting solely from a change in the total number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding as a result of our repurchase of Class B common stock since the last date on which that holder acquired Class B common stock
 (iii) acquisitions of Class B common stock (a) made pursuant to contracts existing prior to the Threshold Date
 including the acquisition of Class B common stock pursuant to the conversion provisions of Series A preferred stock outstanding prior to the Threshold Date
 (b) by bequest or inheritance or by operation of law upon the death or incompetency of any individual
 and (c) by any other transfer made without valuable consideration
 in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing the Class A special rights.&nbsp; A gift made to any person who is related to the donor by blood or marriage
 a gift made to a charitable organization qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended
 or a successor provision and a gift to a person who is a fiduciary solely for the benefit of
 or which is owned entirely by
 one or more persons or entities (a) who are related to the donor by blood or marriage or (b) which is a tax-qualified charitable organization or (c) both will be presumed to be made in good faith and not for purposes of circumventing the restrictions imposed by the Class A special rights.


 to the extent that the voting power of any share of Class B common stock cannot be exercised pursuant to the provision
 that share will be excluded from the determination of the total shares eligible to vote for any purpose for which a vote of shareholders is taken.

.&nbsp; The Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock at any time on a share-for-share basis.&nbsp; The Class A common stock is not convertible into shares of Class B common stock unless the number of outstanding shares of Class B common stock falls below 5% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Class B common stock and Class A common stock.&nbsp; In that event
 immediately upon the occurrence thereof
 all of the outstanding Class A common stock is converted automatically into Class B common stock on a share-for-share basis and Class B common stock will no longer be convertible into Class A common stock.&nbsp; For this purpose
 Class B common stock or Class A common stock repurchased by us and not reissued is not considered to be &#8220;outstanding&#8221; from and after the date of repurchase.


 certificates which formerly represented outstanding shares of Class A common stock thereafter will be deemed to represent a like number of shares of Class B common stock
 and all common stock then authorized will be deemed to be Class B common stock.








 the outstanding shares of preferred stock and convertible participating preferred stock would have priority over the common stock in the distribution of our remaining assets.&nbsp; The 10% Series A preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock on the basis of one share of Class A common stock and one share of Class B common stock for every 20 shares of 10% Series A preferred stock.&nbsp;






 the Charter contains two super-majority voting provisions.&nbsp; Paragraph 5 of the Charter provides that the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the shares present and entitled to vote at the meeting is necessary to amend our bylaws.&nbsp; Paragraph 6 provides that a director may be removed regardless of cause only upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote for the election of that director.&nbsp; Both of these provisions reduce the possibility of the shareholders receiving and accepting hostile takeover bids
 mergers
 proxy contests
 removal of current management
 removal of directors or other changes in control.

 2018
 the Company announced production at its fruit (primarily peaches) processing plant in Modesto
 California will cease prior to the 2018 production season. During the second fiscal quarter of 2019
 the Company sold and transferred most of the remaining inventory in the facility and completed most of the labeling and casing required to PCP for the fruit inventory sold to them in the first quarter. The Company continued to ready the building and equipment for sale during the second quarter and into the third quarter. The Modesto operations have met the requirements (approximately a 15% reduction in revenue and a strategic shift away from producing peaches) for discontinued operations and those operations have been presented as such in these financial statements. During October 2018
 the building and the land was sold to an unrelated third party for net proceeds of $63

 and $0.3 million for the partial sale of a plant in the Northwest ($0.2 million is severance
 $0.1 million is mostly equipment moves). In addition
 the Company recorded a charge for an impairment of long-lived&nbsp;assets of $7.8 million for a Northwest plant that will be ceasing production after this growing season.


 the Company recorded a restructuring credit of $0.3 related to the closing of a plant in the Midwest and Northwest.

 although the Company believes it has the ability to raise additional capital by issuing additional stock
 if it desires.




 2016. Maximum borrowings under the Revolver total $400.0 million from April through July and $500.0 million from August through March.&nbsp; The Revolver balance as of March 31
 2019 was $155.3 million and is included in Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the Revolver&#8217;s July 5
 2021 maturity date. In order to maintain availability of funds under the facility
 the Company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolver. The Revolver is secured by the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable and inventories and contains a financial covenant and borrowing base requirements. The Company utilizes its Revolver for general corporate purposes
 including seasonal working capital needs
 to pay debt principal and interest obligations
 and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. Seasonal working capital needs are affected by the growing cycles of the vegetables and fruits the Company packages. The majority of vegetable and fruit inventories are produced during the months of June through November and are then sold over the following year. Payment terms for vegetable and fruit produce are generally three months but can vary from a few days to seven months. Accordingly
 the Company&#8217;s need to draw on the Revolver may fluctuate significantly throughout the year.

 2016
 the Company entered into a $100.0 million unsecured term loan payable to Farm Credit East
 ACA
 with a variable interest rate. The maturity date for this term loan is December 9
 2021. The Company incurred financing costs totaling $0.2 million which have been classified as a discount to the debt. This agreement contains certain covenants
 including interest coverage ratio. On May 9
 2019
 the Company entered into an amendment with waiver to the agreement to replace the interest coverage ratio financial covenant with a minimum EBITDA covenant. The first measurement of the minimum EBITDA covenant will be for the quarter ending on September 28
 2019 at which time the interest coverage ratio will no longer apply. In the meantime
 the Company needs to maintain at least $175.0 million of excess undrawn availability from its revolver facility at March 31
 2019 and June 29
 2019 to be in compliance with the agreement. As of March 31
 2019
 the Company has maintained at least $175.0 million of excess undrawn availability from its revolver facility.


 2017. At March 31

These financial requirements and ratios generally become more restrictive over time and are subject to allowances for seasonal fluctuations. The most restrictive financial covenant in the debt agreements is the EBITDA within the Farm Credit term loan which for fiscal year end 2020 will need to be greater than $45 million.

 Minnesota
 2) $4.1&nbsp;million for a warehouse in Hart
 Michigan
 and 3) $2.0 for a production line in Janesville
 Wisconsin. Capital expenditures in 2018 totaled $30.5 million and there were two major projects in 2018 as follows: 1) $2.8 million for the expansion of a production line in Princeville
 Illinois
 and 2) $3.4 million for a warehouse in Payette
 Idaho. In addition
 there were lease buyouts
 equipment replacements and other improvements in 2019 and 2018.




 accounts receivable increased by $17.9 million or 27.1% versus 2018 due to higher sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 and a $6.3 million increase in the true-up receivable from B&amp;G Foods. In 2018
 accounts receivable increased by $6.7 million or 9.3% versus 2017
 due to higher sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 and the Truitt business we added in 2018.




 inventories decreased by $45.3&nbsp;million primarily reflecting the effect of lower finished goods quantities from lower yields during the 2018 pack season&nbsp;and by the $16.3 million LIFO reserve increase
 partially offset by higher raw material quantities. The LIFO reserve balance was $161.3&nbsp;million at March 31
 2019 versus $145.0&nbsp;million at the prior year end.






 2019
 the Company sold $60.0 million&nbsp;of Green Giant finished goods inventory to B&amp;G Foods North America (&#8220;B&amp;G&#8221;) for cash
 on a bill and hold basis
 as compared to $112.8&nbsp;million&nbsp;for the year ended March 31
 2018. Under the terms of the bill and hold agreement
 title to the specified inventory transferred to B&amp;G. Under the new revenue recognition standard
 this contract qualifies for bill and hold accounting treatment as the Company has concluded that control of the unlabeled products transfers to the customer at the time title transfers and the Company has the right to payment (prior to physical delivery)
 which results in earlier revenue recognition. Labeling and storage services that are provided after control of the goods has transferred to the customer are accounted for as separate performance obligations for which revenue is deferred until the services are performed.


 which are recorded as a reduction of net sales
 include amounts paid to encourage retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of the Company&#8217;s products to consumers
 amounts paid to obtain favorable display positions in retail stores
 and amounts paid to retailers for shelf space in retail stores. Accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the retailer based on expected levels of performance. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a retailer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. As a result
 the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by retailers for amounts they consider due to them. Final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time.


 plant
 and equipment are depreciated over their assigned lives. The assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective. If actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated
 a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal of the assets could be incurred. Impairment losses are evaluated if the estimated undiscounted value of the cash flows is less than the carrying value. If such is the case
 a loss is recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value.












 2019
 the Company was obligated to make cash payments in connection with its debt
 operating and capital leases
 and purchase commitments. All of these arrangements require cash payments over varying periods of time. Certain of these arrangements are cancelable on short notice and others require additional payments as part of any early termination.


 the Company&#8217;s defined benefit plan has an unfunded pension liability of $17.3 million which is subject to certain actuarial assumptions. The unfunded status decreased by $5.9 million during 2019 reflecting the actual fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation as of March 31
 2019. This unfunded status decrease was recognized via the actual gain on plan assets and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $6.8&nbsp;million after the income tax expense of $2.3 million. The increase in projected benefit obligation was a function of using the full yield curve approach and the change to using an updated mortality table. There was no change in the discount rate as it remained at 4.14%. During 2018
 the Company converted to the 2006 base rates from the RP-2016 mortality study with the Blue Collar adjustment
 with a generational projection of future mortality improvements from 2006 using Scale MP-2018 for calculating the pension obligation in 2018 and the related pension expense in 2019. The Company&nbsp;utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows.&nbsp;


 2018 to $233.1 million as of March 31
 2019 due to a gain on plan assets of $26.7 million from a continued recovery in market conditions and a $2.1 million contribution by the Company. The Company made this contribution to maintain its funding status at an acceptable level.


 the Company entered into new capital and operating leases of approximately $8.3&nbsp;million
 based on the if-purchased value
 which was primarily for agricultural and packaging equipment.




 the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the cash settlements required in future periods.






 unless the issuer gives cancellation notice in advance. On March&nbsp;31
 2019
 the Company had $11.4 million in outstanding standby letters of credit. These standby letters of credit are supported by the Company&#8217;s Revolver and reduce borrowings available under the Revolver.




 the Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3.6&nbsp;million
 which is due to the net impact of $97.1&nbsp;million provided by operating activities
 $67.0&nbsp;million provided by investing activities
 and $167.7&nbsp;million used in financing activities.












 a significant decrease in inventories in 2019 primarily due to exiting the products in Modesto versus 2018 of $168.0 million contributed to cash provided by operating activities.&nbsp; The reversal&nbsp;of the gains on the sale of assets reduced cash provided by operating activities by $63.4 million in 2019 versus $1.9 million in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2019 earnings reflect a LIFO charge of $16.3&nbsp;million resulting&nbsp;in an increase in the tax payment deferral of $4.1&nbsp;million. During 2019
 the Company made a $2.1 million contribution to its pension plan compared to a $2.7 million contribution in the previous year. &nbsp;


 from June through November
 and are then sold over the following year. Cash flow from operating activities is one of the Company&#8217;s main sources of liquidity.




 principally reflecting proceeds from the sales of assets of $104.4 million
 partially offset by capital expenditures. Capital expenditures aggregated $37.7&nbsp;million in 2019 versus $32.7&nbsp;million in 2018. There were three major projects in 2019 as follows: 1) $1.6 million purchase of land in Montgomery
 Minnesota
 2) $4.1 million for a warehouse in Hart
 Michigan and 3) $2.0 million for a production line in Janesville

 from $1
162.9&nbsp;million to $1

 a $94.7&nbsp;million increase in canned vegetables sales
 a $7.3 million increase in frozen sales
 a $1.1 million increase in other sales
 a $0.9 million increase in fruit sales
 a $0.4 million decrease in snack sales
 and a $53.7&nbsp;million decrease in Green Giant sales
 a $13.2&nbsp;million decrease in prepared food sales. The increase in sales is attributable to increased sales volume of $2.4&nbsp;million and higher selling prices/more favorable sales mix of $34.3&nbsp;million. The increased selling prices/more favorable sales mix is primarily due to canned vegetables.

 a gain on the sale of a plant in the Northeast $2.0 million and a gain on the partial closure of a plant of $0.8 million. The Company also recorded a loss on the sale of an Eastern plant of $0.6 million. The Company also recorded a gain for interest rate swap of $0.3 million. Other operating income in 2018 includes an acquisition gain of $1.8 million
 a gain on the sale of a plant of $1.1 million and a gain on the partial sale of a plant of $0.4 million. The Company also recorded a gain of $0.4 million on the sale of fixed assets.


 which are described in detail in the Restructuring section of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 increased from a benefit of $(0.3) million in 2018 to a charge of $11.7 million in 2019.


 net
 increased from $12.8&nbsp;million in 2018 to $15.4&nbsp;million in 2019 due in part to the higher interest rates on variable rate borrowings in 2019 versus 2018. Approximately $3.0 million of this interest expense increase was as a result of rising interest rates. This was partially offset by lower average Revolver borrows which is net of certain long-term debt paid off during the year.


 continuing pre-tax earnings decreased from $8.7&nbsp;million in 2018&nbsp;to pre-tax loss of $(49.3) million in 2019. The effective tax rate was 25.9% in 2019 and (15.1)% in 2018.&nbsp; The increase of 41.0 percentage points in the effective tax rate for the year is the result of the change in income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. The change in income tax rate resulted in a 42.1 percentage point decrease in the 2018 tax rate and it did not impact the 2019 income tax rate.












 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 &#8220;Leases.&#8221; ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11
 Targeted Improvements - Leases (Topic 842). This update provides an optional transition method that allows entities to elect to apply the standard retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption
 versus recasting the prior periods presented. If elected
 an entity would recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018. We currently expect to adopt ASU 2016-02 as of April 1
 2019
 using the optional transition method provided by ASU 2018-11.&nbsp; Our evaluation of ASU 2016-02 is ongoing and not complete. Our estimated date of completion of FASB ASC 842 technical assessment of applying the new standard to the Company&#8217;s lease contracts is between Q4 of fiscal year 2019 and Q1 of Fiscal Year 2020. The estimated date of revised Internal Control over of Financial Reporting (ICFR) is Q1&nbsp;of fiscal year 2020. The estimated date of draft footnote disclosures is Q1 of fiscal year 2020.&nbsp;The Company believes that the new standard will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of ROU assets and liabilities for the Company&#8217;s operating leases but it will not have a material impact on its statement of operations or liquidity. We expect our accounting for capital leases to remain substantially unchanged. The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount
 timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements
 providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Our leasing activity is primarily related to buildings and equipment.


 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with customers
 now commonly referred to as Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). The FASB issued ASC 606 to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the most current revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when control of performance obligations as stipulated in the contracts
 is transferred to a customer for an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for promised goods and services. The Company adopted ASC 606 as of April 1
 2018
 utilizing the full retrospective method of transition
 which requires a restatement of each prior reporting period presented. In adopting ASC 606
 the Company used the practical expedient where the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations before the date of the initial application is not disclosed. The Company implemented new policies
 processes and systems to enable both the preparation of financial information and internal controls over financial reporting in connection with its adoption of ASC 606. The primary impact of adopting ASC 606 on the Company&#8217;s 2019 and 2018 revenue was to report the product sales to B&amp;G as bill and hold sales
 but deferring a small portion of the sale for future case and labeling services along with storage services. See Note 4 to&nbsp;the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.&nbsp;


 the FASB issued ASU 2017-07
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASU 2017-07 requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs from defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans be included in the same statement of earnings captions as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the covered employees during the period.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other components of net benefit cost will be presented in the statement of earnings separately from service costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31
 2017 (fiscal year 2019 for the Company).&nbsp;&nbsp;Following adoption
 only service costs will be eligible for capitalization into manufactured inventories
 which should reduce diversity in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments of ASU 2017-07 should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit costs from defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans in the statement of earnings and prospectively
 on and after the effective date
 for the capitalization of the service cost component into manufactured inventories.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted the new guidance in first quarter of fiscal year 2019
 and the changes to earnings before income taxes were immaterial in the year of adoption.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02
 This amendment is intended to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting only from the December 2017 enacted United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and is not intended to impact underlying accounting guidance that requires that the effect of a change in tax laws or tax rates be included in income from operations. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31
 2018 with earlier adoption permitted. The Company has early adopted this update in its fourth quarter ended March 31
 2018 resulting in a $2.4 million reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss and a corresponding $2.4 million increase to retained earnings. This reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss relates to the deferred income tax stranded tax effects resulting from the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the TCJA.&nbsp; The pension and post-retirement benefits adjustment is the Company&#8217;s only component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

 and are critical to the support of the business. Trade promotion costs
 which are recorded as a reduction of sales
 include amounts paid to retailers for shelf space
 to obtain favorable display positions and to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of our products to consumers. Accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale to the retailer based on expected levels of performance. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a retailer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. As a result
 the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by retailers. Final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time.

&#8212; Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments. Wholesale and retail food distributors comprise a significant portion of the trade receivables; collateral is generally not required. A relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the Company&#8217;s total sales. Green Giant sales to B &amp; G Foods represented 6%
 and 11% of net sales in each of 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The top ten customers
 including B &amp; G Foods
 represented approximately 47%
 and 45% of net sales for 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The Company closely monitors the credit risk associated with its customers. The Company places substantially all of its interest-bearing investments with financial institutions and monitors credit exposure. Cash and short-term investments in certain accounts exceed the federal insured limit; however
 the Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.



The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents (Level 1)

 the Company provides for depreciation on the straight-line method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the various assets. Depreciation was $29.5&nbsp;million and $29.0&nbsp;million
 in 2019
 and 2018
 respectively. The estimated useful lives are as follows: buildings and improvements &#8212; 30&nbsp;years; machinery and equipment &#8212; 10-15&nbsp;years; computer software &#8212; 3-5&nbsp;years; vehicles &#8212; 3-7&nbsp;years; and land improvements &#8212; 10-20&nbsp;years.



&#8212; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 as well as the related revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.









 &#8212; In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 &#8220;Leases.&#8221; ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11
 Targeted Improvements - Leases (Topic 842). This update provides an optional transition method that allows entities to elect to apply the standard retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption
 versus recasting the prior periods presented. If elected
 an entity would recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018. We currently expect to adopt ASU 2016-02 as of April 1
 2019
 using the optional transition method provided by ASU 2018-11.&nbsp; Our evaluation of ASU 2016-02 is ongoing and not complete. Our estimated date of completion of FASB ASC 842 technical assessment of applying the new standard to the Company&#8217;s lease contracts is between Q4 of fiscal year 2019 and Q1 of fiscal year 2020. The estimated date of revised Internal Control over of Financial Reporting (ICFR) is Q1&nbsp;of fiscal year 2020. The estimated date of draft footnote disclosures is Q1 of Fiscal Year 2020.&nbsp;The Company believes that the new standard will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of ROU assets and liabilities for the Company&#8217;s operating leases but it will not have a material impact on its statement of operations or liquidity. We expect our accounting for capital leases to remain substantially unchanged. The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount
 timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements
 providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Our leasing activity is primarily related to buildings and equipment.&nbsp;


 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with customers
 now commonly referred to as Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). The FASB issued ASC 606 to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the most current revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when control of performance obligations as stipulated in the contracts
 is transferred to a customer for an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for promised goods and services. The Company adopted ASC 606 as of April 1
 2018
 utilizing the full retrospective method of transition
 which requires a restatement of each prior reporting period presented. In adopting ASC 606
 the Company used the practical expedient where the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations before the date of the initial application is not disclosed. The Company implemented new policies
 processes and systems to enable both the preparation of financial information and internal controls over financial reporting in connection with its adoption of ASC 606. The primary impact of adopting ASC 606 on the Company&#8217;s 2019 and 2018 revenue was to report the product sales to B&amp;G as bill and hold sales
 but deferring a small portion of the sale for future case and labeling services along with storage services. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.&nbsp;


 the FASB issued ASU 2017-07
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASU 2017-07 requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs from defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans be included in the same statement of earnings captions as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the covered employees during the period.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other components of net benefit cost will be presented in the statement of earnings separately from service costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31
 2017 (fiscal year 2019 for the Company).&nbsp;&nbsp;Following adoption
 only service costs will be eligible for capitalization into manufactured inventories
 which should reduce diversity in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments of ASU 2017-07 should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit costs from defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans in the statement of earnings and prospectively
 on and after the effective date
 for the capitalization of the service cost component into manufactured inventories.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted the new guidance in first quarter of fiscal year 2019
 and the changes to earnings before income taxes were immaterial in the year of adoption.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02
 This amendment is intended to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting only from the December 2017 enacted United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and is not intended to impact underlying accounting guidance that requires that the effect of a change in tax laws or tax rates be included in income from operations. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31
 2018 with earlier adoption permitted. The Company has early adopted this update in its fourth quarter ended March 31
 2018 resulting in a $2.4 million reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss and a corresponding $2.4 million increase to retained earnings. This reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss relates to the deferred income tax stranded tax effects resulting from the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the TCJA.&nbsp; The pension and post-retirement benefits adjustment is the Company&#8217;s only component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

















		


 2019
 the Company has certain operating units in the Midwest that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale
 which requires the Company to present the related assets and liabilities as separate line items in our&nbsp;Consolidated Balance Sheets.&nbsp; The Company is required to record the assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.&nbsp; The following table presents information related to the major classes of assets and liabilities that were held for sale in our&nbsp;March&nbsp; 31

 2018
 the Company executed a nonbinding letter of intent with a perspective buyer of the Modesto facility. On October 9
 2018
 the Company closed on the sale of the facility to this outside buyer with net proceeds of $63
326
000. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019
 the Company ceased use of the Modesto facility. Based on its magnitude of revenue to the Company (approximately 15%) and because the Company was exiting the production of peaches
 this sale represented a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results. Accordingly
 the Company has applied discontinued operations treatment for this sale as required by Accounting Standards Codification 210-05&#8212;Discontinued Operations. This business we are exiting is part of the Fruit and Vegetable segment.

 no terms beyond one year are granted at contract inception.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result
 we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between our transfer of a promised good or service to a customer and the customer&#8217;s payment for that good or service will be generally 30 days&nbsp;or less.&nbsp;&nbsp;








 some contracts include some form of variable consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of the Company&#8217;s branded products
 and are critical to the support of the business. Trade promotion costs
 which are recorded as a reduction of sales
 include amounts paid to retailers for shelf space
 to obtain favorable display positions and to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of our products to consumers. Accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale to the retailer based on expected levels of performance. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a retailer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. As a result
 the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by retailers. Final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time.

 Revolving Credit Facility
 for discussion of the Revolver.


 2016
 the Company entered into a $100.0 million unsecured term loan payable to Farm Credit East
 ACA
 with a variable interest rate. The maturity date for this term loan is December 9
 2021. The Company incurred financing costs totaling $0.2 million which have been classified as a discount to the debt. This agreement contains certain covenants
 including interest coverage ratio. On May 9
 2019
 the Company entered into an amendment with waiver to the agreement to replace the interest coverage ratio financial covenant with a minimum EBITDA covenant. The first measurement of the minimum EBITDA covenant will be for the quarter ending on September 28
 2019 at which time the interest coverage ratio will no longer apply. In the meantime
 the Company needs to maintain at least $175.0 million of excess undrawn availability from its revolver facility at March 31
 2019 and June 29
 2019 to be in compliance with the agreement. As of March 31
 2019
 the Company has maintained at least $175.0 million of excess undrawn availability from its revolver facility.


 2017. At March 31
 2019
 the total outstanding of this bond is $10.0 million. The bond has a variable interest rate with a maturity date of October 1
 2032.

 make other restricted payments
 including investments
 sell the Company&#8217;s assets

 transfer all or substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets and enter into consolidations or mergers. The Company&#8217;s debt agreements also require the Company to meet certain financial covenants
 including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio
 a minimum EBITDA and minimum tangible net worth. The Revolver also contains borrowing base requirements related to accounts receivable and inventories. These financial requirements and ratios generally become more restrictive over time and are subject to allowances for seasonal fluctuations. The most restrictive financial covenant in the debt agreements is the EBITDA within the Farm Credit term loan which for fiscal year end 2020 will need to be greater than $45 million. The Company computes its financial covenants as if the Company were on the FIFO method of inventory accounting. The Company has met&nbsp;all such financial covenants as of March 31
 2019.

 2017
 the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation. This legislation makes significant changes in U.S. tax law including a reduction in the corporate tax rates
 changes to net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks
 and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The legislation reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from&nbsp;31.5% for the&nbsp;Company's&nbsp;fiscal 2018 and then down to 21% starting in fiscal 2019. As a result of the enacted law
 the Company was required to revalue deferred tax assets and liabilities at the rate in effect during their scheduled reversal. This revaluation resulted in a benefit of $3.3 million to income tax expense and a corresponding reduction in the net deferred tax liability as of March 31
 2018.&nbsp; The other provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did not have a material impact on the fiscal 2018 consolidated financial statements.

 the Company has recorded a valuation allowance amounting to $4.0 million
 which relates primarily to tax credit carryforwards which management has concluded it is more likely than not they will not all be realized in the ordinary course of operations. Although realization is not assured
 management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was determined to be unnecessary
 will be realized in the ordinary course of operations. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable

 could be reduced if actual future income or income taxes rates are lower than estimated or if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing taxable or deductible temporary differences.

 2019 nor 2018 include tax positions that are highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting
 other than interest and penalties
 the disallowance of these positions would not impact the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the tax authority to an earlier period.


 2019 and 2018
 the Company recognized approximately $0.1 million decrease and $0.0 million
 respectively
 in interest and penalties. As of March&nbsp;31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had approximately $0.0 million and $0.1 million
 respectively
 of interest and penalties accrued associated with unrecognized tax benefits.


 there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the Company. Conversely
 if resolved favorably in the future
 the related provisions would be reduced
 thus having a positive impact on earnings. During 2019
 the statute of limitations lapsed on a number of uncertain tax positions and&nbsp;the lapse results in the positions no longer being uncertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore
 in accordance with its accounting policies
 the Company recorded a decrease to the liability and a decrease to tax expense of $0.5 million.

 2019. This unfunded status decrease was recognized via the actual gain on plan assets and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $6.8&nbsp;million after the income tax expense of $2.3 million. The increase in projected benefit obligation was a function of using the full yield curve approach and the change to using an updated mortality table. There was no change in the discount rate as it remained at 4.14%. During 2018
 the Company converted to the 2006 base rates from the RP-2016 mortality study with the Blue Collar adjustment
 with a generational projection of future mortality improvements from 2006 using Scale MP-2018 for calculating the pension obligation in 2018 and the related pension expense in 2019. The Company&nbsp;utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows.&nbsp;


 2018 to $233.1 million as of March 31
 2019 due to a gain on plan assets of $26.7 million from a continued recovery in market conditions and the $2.1 million contribution by the Company. The Company made this contribution to maintain its funding status at an acceptable level.

The Company seeks to accomplish its return objectives by prudently investing in a diversified portfolio of public company equities with broad industry representation seeking to provide long-term growth consistent with the performance of relevant market indices
 as well as maintain an adequate level of liquidity for pension distributions as they fall due. The strategy of being fully invested in equities has historically provided greater rates of return over extended periods of time. The Company&#8217;s gain on plan assets during 2019 was 12.6% as compared to the S&amp;P 500 unaudited gain (excluding dividends) of 7.3%.

 2007 (beginning of 4th quarter of fiscal Year 2008)
 the Company changed its inventory valuation method from the lower of cost
 determined under the FIFO method
 or market to the lower of cost
 determined under the LIFO method
 or market. In the high inflation environment that the Company was experiencing
 the Company believed that the LIFO inventory method was preferable over the FIFO method because it better compares the cost of current production to current revenue. The effect of LIFO was to reduce continuing net earnings by $30.4 million in 2019 and to reduce continuing net earnings by $9.8 million in 2018
 compared to what would have been reported using the FIFO inventory method. The reduction in continuing earnings per share was $3.14 ($3.14 diluted) in 2019; and a reduction in continuing earnings per share of $1.00 ($1.00 diluted) in 2018. There was a LIFO liquidation of $28.7 million in 2019. Most of this LIFO liquidation in 2019 is reported as Discontinued Operations since it related to the Modesto fruit (see Discontinued Operations Note 3). There was no LIFO liquidations during the period ended March 31
 2018.

 the Company purchased a 50% equity interest in Truitt Bros. Inc. (Truitt) for $16.2 million which was accounted for as an equity investment. The purchase agreement granted the Company the right to acquire the remaining 50% ownership of Truitt in the future under certain conditions. On April 3
 2017
 the Company purchased the remaining 50% equity interest in Truitt. This was considered a step acquisition
 whereby the Company remeasured the previously held investment to fair value during the first quarter of 2018. As a result
 the Company&#8217;s 2018 net loss includes a non-taxable bargain purchase gain of $1.8 million of which $0.9 million was related to the remeasurement of the previously held investment. Gross profit in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 included a charge of $0.5 million related to the recognition of the Truitt inventory step-up through cost of sales for the portion of acquired inventory that was sold during the period. The business
 based in Salem
 Oregon
 has two state-of-the-art plants located in Oregon and Kentucky. The purchase price for the more recent 50% was $14.4 million (net of cash acquired of $3.0 million) plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The Company had an equity method investment of $17.4 million
 so the total investment was $34.9 million. In conjunction with the transaction closing
 the Company paid off $3.6 million of liabilities acquired. The rationale for the acquisition was twofold: (1) the business is a complementary fit with our existing business and (2) Truitt is known for its industry innovation related to packing shelf stable foods in trays
 pouches and bowls. This acquisition was financed with proceeds from the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price to acquire Truitt Bros.
 Inc. was allocated based on the internally developed fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the independent valuation of inventory
 intangibles
 and property
 plant
 and equipment. The total purchase price of $31.8 million has been allocated as follows (in thousands):

000
 reduced by aggregate annual dividend payments totaling $23
000 that the Company presently pays on two outstanding classes of preferred stock. Payment of dividends to common stockholders is made at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and depends
 among other factors
 on earnings; capital requirements; and the operating and financial condition of the Company. The Company has not declared or paid a common dividend in many years.

 &lt;/div&gt;the Company purchased a &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;50%&lt;/div&gt; equity interest in Truitt Bros. Inc. (Truitt) for &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$16.2&lt;/div&gt; million which was accounted for as an equity investment. The purchase agreement granted the Company the right to acquire the remaining &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;50%&lt;/div&gt; ownership of Truitt in the future under certain conditions. On &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt; April 3
 2017
 &lt;/div&gt;the Company purchased the remaining &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;50%&lt;/div&gt; equity interest in Truitt. This was considered a step acquisition
 whereby the Company remeasured the previously held investment to fair value during the &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;first&lt;/div&gt; quarter of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018.&lt;/div&gt; As a result
 the Company&amp;#x2019;s &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018&lt;/div&gt; net loss includes a non-taxable bargain purchase gain of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$1.8&lt;/div&gt; million of which &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$0.9&lt;/div&gt; million was related to the remeasurement of the previously held investment. Gross profit in the &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;first&lt;/div&gt; quarter of fiscal &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018&lt;/div&gt; included a charge of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$0.5&lt;/div&gt; million related to the recognition of the Truitt inventory step-up through cost of sales for the portion of acquired inventory that was sold during the period. The business
 based in Salem
 Oregon
 has &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;two&lt;/div&gt; state-of-the-art plants located in Oregon and Kentucky. The purchase price for the more recent &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;50%&lt;/div&gt; was &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$14.4&lt;/div&gt; million (net of cash acquired of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$3.0&lt;/div&gt; million) plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The Company had an equity method investment of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$17.4&lt;/div&gt; million
 so the total investment was &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$34.9&lt;/div&gt; million. In conjunction with the transaction closing
 the Company paid off &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$3.6&lt;/div&gt; million of liabilities acquired. The rationale for the acquisition was twofold: (&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;) the business is a complementary fit with our existing business and (&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;) Truitt is known for its industry innovation related to packing shelf stable foods in trays
 pouches and bowls. This acquisition was financed with proceeds from the Company's revolving credit facility. The purchase price to acquire Truitt Bros.
 Inc. was allocated based on the internally developed fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the independent valuation of inventory
 intangibles
 and property

 the Company is made a party to certain legal proceedings seeking monetary damages
 including proceedings involving product liability claims
 workers&amp;#x2019; compensation along with other employee claims
 tort and other general liability claims
 for which it carries insurance
 as well as patent infringement and related litigation. The Company is in a highly regulated industry and is also periodically involved in government actions for regulatory violations and other matters surrounding the manufacturing of its products
 including
 but &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;not&lt;/div&gt; limited to
 environmental
 employee
 and product safety issues. While it is &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;not&lt;/div&gt; feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters
 the Company does &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;not&lt;/div&gt; believe that an adverse decision in any of these legal proceedings would have a material adverse impact on its financial position
 results of operations

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

&lt;/div&gt; and &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;11%&lt;/div&gt; of net sales in each of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019&lt;/div&gt; and &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018
&lt;/div&gt; respectively. The top &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;ten&lt;/div&gt; customers
 including B &amp;amp; G Foods
 represented approximately &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;47%
&lt;/div&gt; and &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;45%&lt;/div&gt; of net sales for &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019&lt;/div&gt; and &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018
&lt;/div&gt; respectively. The Company closely monitors the credit risk associated with its customers.

 2019 &lt;/div&gt;was &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$155.3&lt;/div&gt; million
 with a weighted average interest rate of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;4.00%&lt;/div&gt; (LIBOR plus a spread) and is included in Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Revolver is secured by accounts receivable and inventories with a carrying value of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$585.9&lt;/div&gt; million. The Company had &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$11.4&lt;/div&gt; million and &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$10.4&lt;/div&gt; million of outstanding standby letters of credit as of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt; March&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;31
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019&lt;/div&gt; and &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018
&lt;/div&gt; respectively
 which reduces borrowing availability under the Revolver. See Note &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;6

 &lt;/div&gt;the Company has certain operating units in the Midwest that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale
 which requires the Company to present the related assets and liabilities as separate line items in our&amp;nbsp;Consolidated Balance Sheets.&amp;nbsp; The Company is required to record the assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.&amp;nbsp; The following table presents information related to the major classes of assets and liabilities that were held for sale in our&amp;nbsp;&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt; March&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;31

&lt;/div&gt; the Company ceased use of the Modesto facility. Based on its magnitude of revenue to the Company (approximately &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;15%&lt;/div&gt;) and because the Company was exiting the production of peaches
 this sale represented a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on the Company&amp;#x2019;s operations and financial results. Accordingly

 2017
 &lt;/div&gt;the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation. This legislation makes significant changes in U.S. tax law including a reduction in the corporate tax rates
 changes to net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks
 and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The legislation reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from&amp;nbsp;&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;31.5%&lt;/div&gt; for the&amp;nbsp;Company's&amp;nbsp;fiscal &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018&lt;/div&gt; and then down to &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;21%&lt;/div&gt; starting in fiscal &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019.&lt;/div&gt; As a result of the enacted law
 the Company was required to revalue deferred tax assets and liabilities at the rate in effect during their scheduled reversal. This revaluation resulted in a benefit of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$3.3&lt;/div&gt; million to income tax expense and a corresponding reduction in the net deferred tax liability as of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt; March 31

 the Company changed its inventory valuation method from the lower of cost
 determined under the FIFO method
 or market to the lower of cost
 determined under the LIFO method
 or market. In the high inflation environment that the Company was experiencing
 the Company believed that the LIFO inventory method was preferable over the FIFO method because it better compares the cost of current production to current revenue. The effect of LIFO was to reduce continuing net earnings by &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$30.4&lt;/div&gt; million in &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019&lt;/div&gt; and to reduce continuing net earnings by &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$9.8&lt;/div&gt; million in &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018
&lt;/div&gt; compared to what would have been reported using the FIFO inventory method. The reduction in continuing earnings per share was &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$3.14&lt;/div&gt; (&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$3.14&lt;/div&gt; diluted) in &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019;&lt;/div&gt; and a reduction in continuing earnings per share of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$1.00&lt;/div&gt; (&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$1.00&lt;/div&gt; diluted) in &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018.&lt;/div&gt; There was a LIFO liquidation of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$28.7&lt;/div&gt; million in &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019.&lt;/div&gt; Most of this LIFO liquidation in &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019&lt;/div&gt; is reported as Discontinued Operations since it related to the Modesto fruit (see Discontinued Operations Note &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;).

This update provides an optional transition method that allows entities to elect to apply the standard retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption
 versus recasting the prior periods presented. If elected
 an entity would recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt; December 15

The FASB issued ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606&lt;/div&gt; to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the most current revenue recognition guidance. ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606&lt;/div&gt; requires the recognition of revenue when control of performance obligations as stipulated in the contracts
 is transferred to a customer for an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for promised goods and services. The Company adopted ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606&lt;/div&gt; as of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt; April 1

 &lt;/div&gt;utilizing the full retrospective method of transition
 which requires a restatement of each prior reporting period presented. In adopting ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606

 2019. &lt;/div&gt;This unfunded status decrease was recognized via the actual gain on plan assets and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$6.8&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;million after the income tax expense of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$2.3&lt;/div&gt; million. The increase in projected benefit obligation was a function of using the full yield curve approach and the change to using an updated mortality table. There was &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;no&lt;/div&gt; change in the discount rate as it remained at &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;4.14%.&lt;/div&gt; During &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018

The Company seeks to accomplish its return objectives by prudently investing in a diversified portfolio of public company equities with broad industry representation seeking to provide long-term growth consistent with the performance of relevant market indices
 as well as maintain an adequate level of liquidity for pension distributions as they fall due. The strategy of being fully invested in equities has historically provided greater rates of return over extended periods of time. The Company&amp;#x2019;s gain on plan assets during &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019&lt;/div&gt; was &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;12.6%&lt;/div&gt; as compared to the S&amp;amp;P &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;500&lt;/div&gt; unaudited gain (excluding dividends) of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;7.3%.&lt;/div&gt; Plan assets include Company common stock with a fair market value of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;$12.8&lt;/div&gt; million as of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt; March&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;31

 now commonly referred to as Accounting Standards Codification Topic &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606&lt;/div&gt; (&amp;#x201c;ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606&amp;#x201d;&lt;/div&gt;). The FASB issued ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606&lt;/div&gt; to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the most current revenue recognition guidance. ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606&lt;/div&gt; requires the recognition of revenue when control of performance obligations as stipulated in the contracts
 is transferred to a customer for an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for promised goods and services. The Company adopted ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606&lt;/div&gt; as of &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt; April 1
 2018
 &lt;/div&gt;utilizing the full retrospective method of transition
 which requires a restatement of each prior reporting period presented. In adopting ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606
&lt;/div&gt; the Company used the practical expedient where the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations before the date of the initial application is &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;not&lt;/div&gt; disclosed. The Company implemented new policies
 processes and systems to enable both the preparation of financial information and internal controls over financial reporting in connection with its adoption of ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606.&lt;/div&gt; The primary impact of adopting ASC &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;606&lt;/div&gt; on the Company&amp;#x2019;s &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019&lt;/div&gt; and &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018&lt;/div&gt; revenue was to report the product sales to B&amp;amp;G as bill and hold sales

 &lt;/div&gt;the FASB issued ASU &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2017&lt;/div&gt;-&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;07

 2017 (&lt;/div&gt;fiscal year &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019&lt;/div&gt; for the Company).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Following adoption
 only service costs will be eligible for capitalization into manufactured inventories
 which should reduce diversity in practice.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The amendments of ASU &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2017&lt;/div&gt;-&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;07&lt;/div&gt; should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit costs from defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans in the statement of earnings and prospectively
 on and after the effective date
 for the capitalization of the service cost component into manufactured inventories.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Company adopted the new guidance in &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;first&lt;/div&gt; quarter of fiscal year &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2019

 &lt;/div&gt;the FASB issued ASU &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;No.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;2018&lt;/div&gt;-&lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt;02

This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after &lt;div style=display: inline; font-style: italic; font-weight: inherit; font-style: normal;&gt; December 31
 2018 &lt;/div&gt;with earlier adoption permitted.

Purchase Agreement
 Additional Percentage of Voting Interests Acquirable


















In a business combination achieved in stages
 this element represents the impact to cost of goods sold due to the increase in the fair value of inventory as a result of remeasuring to fair value the equity interest in the acquiree it held before the business combination.






















































































In a business combination in which the amount of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the aggregate consideration transferred or to be transferred (as defined)
 this element represents the amount of gain recognized by the entity.




























Amount of consideration transferred
 consisting of acquisition-date fair value of assets transferred by the acquirer
 liabilities incurred by the acquirer
 and equity interest issued by the acquirer.




























Fair value at acquisition-date of the assets transferred by the acquirer
 liabilities incurred by the acquirer
 and equity interests issued by the acquirer
 including but not limited to
  instruments or interests issued or issuable in consideration for the business combination.




























Amount of long-term debt due after one year or the normal operating cycle
 if longer
 assumed at the acquisition date.




























In a business combination achieved in stages
 this element represents the amount of gain recognized by the entity as a result of remeasuring to fair value the equity interest in the acquiree it held before the business combination.




























The cash inflow associated with the acquisition of business during the period (for example
 cash that was held by the acquired business).






















































































This item represents the carrying amount on the entity's balance sheet of its investment in common stock of an equity method investee. This is not an indicator of the fair value of the investment
 rather it is the initial cost adjusted for the entity's share of earnings and losses of the investee
 adjusted for any distributions (dividends) and other than temporary impairment (OTTI) losses recognized.
