 Mr. Colin Povall
 president and sole director
 incorporated the Company in the State of Nevada and established a fiscal year end of March 31. FIRST FIXTURES
 INC. is a development-stage company that intends to market and sell kitchen and bathroom fixtures online through its&#8217; intended website. Other than its President
 the Company has no employees. We intend to contract with specialists to develop our logo and website
 and contract with an Internet advertising and search engine specialist to assist us in development of our planned business. The Company has currently no arrangements or understandings in place with any specialists to develop our logo
 to develop our website and to develop our planned business through Internet advertising and search engines.


 INC. is a shell company as defined in Rule 405
 because it is a company with nominal operations and it has assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly
 there will be illiquidity of any future trading market until the company is no longer considered a shell company.




 Ltd.
specializes in manufacturing spigot
 sanitary material
 and copper hardware components. Although our potential supplier has an &#8220;Add to Basket&#8221; on their website
 there is no customer accessible &#8220;Check Out&#8221; function nor customer accessible &#8220;Payment&#8221; function&#8221; on our potential supplier&#8217;s website. Therefore
 we are of the opinion that potential First Fixtures customers cannot buy directly from our potential supplier. FIRST FIXTURES
 INC. intends to market our planned products on the Internet. Over the twelve months following the date of this offering
 the Company&#8217;s business activities and related expenses will be affected by the proceeds from sales of shares in this offering received by the Company as discussed below.




 Ltd. have a broad range of style and finish. Faucet finish will include oil rubbed bronze
 brushed nickel and chrome plating. Tub/shower faucets will include deck mounted
 wall mounted and freestanding with hand showers. Bathroom basin taps will include free standing and deck mount basin taps while kitchen faucets will include wall mount and deck mount faucets with hand sprayers.

 we intend to apply for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). In order to be quoted on the OTCBB
 a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA

 2014 (date of inception) through March 31
 2015
 the Company has not implemented its plan of operation therefore we had no revenue. Expenses for the year ended March 31
 2015 totaled $16
669 consisting primarily of Office and general expense

 meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. With the exception of cash advances from our sole Officer and Director
 our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year.


 2015
 we had $Nil in cash. As of the date of this Form 10-K statement
 the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to fund the expenses related to this offering
 continue maintaining a reporting status. The Company&#8217;s sole officer and director
 Mr. Povall has indicated that he may be willing to provide a maximum of $25
000
 required to fund the offering expenses and maintain the reporting status
 in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company. However
 there is no contract or written agreement in place.




 INC. is a development-stage company that intends to market and sell its planned products through its&#8217; intended website. The Company has not yet implemented its business model and to date and has generated no revenues. It is the Company&#8217;s intention to provide its customers with the quality kitchen and bathroom fixtures. The Company&#8217;s target market will be home builders or home owners that have an interest in home renovations.





















 we do not have any arrangements for financing and we may be unable to obtain financing when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors
 including the Company&#8217;s ability to attract customers. The Company may be unable to access to capital markets in the future or that financing
 adequate to satisfy the cash requirements of implementing our business strategies
 will be available on acceptable terms. The inability of the Company to gain access to capital markets or obtain acceptable financing could have a material adverse effect upon the results of its operations and upon its financial conditions.


 our Company must raise capital to introduce its planned products and start sales. We intend to market our products on the Internet. We have two planned phases to our operations over the next twelve months. The business activities and related expenses in each phase will be affected by the proceeds from sales of shares in this offering received by the Company as discussed below. The Company requires a minimum of $25
000 to implement its business plan.

 the Company has a working capital deficit of $13

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts

 as required by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404 A. The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


 management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31
 2015.


 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company's Chief Financial Officer in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of March 31
 2015 and communicated the matters to our management.


 (3) and (4) above did not have an affect on the Company's financial results. However
 management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Company's determination to its financial statements for the future years.





















 we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.


 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
 will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's Board. In addition
 management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further
 management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future.

 statements of operations

491.&#13;As at March 31
 2015
 the Company has a working capital deficit of $13
491. The Company will require additional funding to meet&#13;its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is&#13;dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these&#13;factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue&#13;to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These financial statements&#13;do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts

 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity&#13;exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee&#13;services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123

 &amp;#34;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
&amp;#34;&#13;and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange&#13;for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation&#13;costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. As of March 31

 &amp;#34;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
&amp;#34;&#13;and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (&amp;#34;APB&amp;#34;) Opinion No. 25
 &amp;#34;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
&amp;#34;&#13;and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange&#13;for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation&#13;costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. As of March 31

 &amp;#147;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting&#13;Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810

First
Fixtures
 Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on February 21
 2014 and established a fiscal year
end of March 31. The Company is organized to sell plumbing fixtures over the internet.

Basis
of presentation 

The
financial statements present the balance sheet
 statements of operations
 stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows of the Company.
These financial statements are presented in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

Going
concern

To
date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $18
491.
As at March 31
 2015
 the Company has a working capital deficit of $13
491. The Company will require additional funding to meet
its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these
factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue
to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
 or amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions

Preparation
of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly
 actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Financial
Instruments

The
carrying amount of the Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair values due to their short term
maturities.

Basic
and Diluted Loss per Common Share

The
basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income available to common shareholders by
the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing
the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for
any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due
to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. As of March 31
 2015 and 2014
 there were no common stock equivalents outstanding.

Income
Taxes

The
Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.

Stock-based
Compensation

The
Company follows ASC 718-10
 &#34;Stock Compensation&#34;
 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 &#34;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
&#34;
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (&#34;APB&#34;) Opinion No. 25
 &#34;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
&#34;
and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation
costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. As of March 31
 2015 the Company
had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded
to date.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-10
 &#147;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#148;. The guidance eliminates
the definition of a development stage entity thereby removing the incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP
for development stage entities
 primarily presentation of inception to date financial information. The provisions of the amendments
are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 and the interim periods therein. However
 early
adoption is permitted. Accordingly
 the Company has adopted this standard as of June 30
 2014.

The
Company does not expect the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial
statements.

The
financial statements present the balance sheet
 statements of operations
 stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows of the Company.
These financial statements are presented in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.




To
date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $18

As at March 31

 the Company has a working capital deficit of $13
491. The Company will require additional funding to meet

 these
factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue
to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
 or amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.




Preparation
of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly
 actual
results could differ from those estimates.




For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.




The
carrying amount of the Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair values due to their short term
maturities.




The
basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income available to common shareholders by
the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing
the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for
any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due
to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. As of March 31
 2015 and 2014
 there were no common stock equivalents outstanding.





The
Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are

 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 &#34;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
&#34;
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (&#34;APB&#34;) Opinion No. 25
 &#34;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
&#34;
and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation
costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. As of March 31
 2015 the Company
had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded
to date.




In

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-10

The
Company does not expect the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial
statements.



































The entire disclosure for the basis of presentation and significant accounting policies concepts. Basis of presentation describes the underlying basis used to prepare the financial statements (for example
 US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting
 IFRS).  Accounting policies describe all significant accounting policies of the reporting entity.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents
 including the policy for determining which items are treated as cash equivalents. Other information that may be disclosed includes (1) the nature of any restrictions on the entity's use of its cash and cash equivalents
 (2) whether the entity's cash and cash equivalents are insured or expose the entity to credit risk
 (3) the classification of any negative balance accounts (overdrafts)
 and (4) the carrying basis of cash equivalents (for example
 at cost) and whether the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for computing basic and diluted earnings or loss per share for each class of common stock and participating security. Addresses all significant policy factors
 including any antidilutive items that have been excluded from the computation and takes into account stock dividends
 splits and reverse splits that occur after the balance sheet date of the latest reporting period but before the issuance of the financial statements.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for fair value measurements of financial and non-financial assets
 liabilities and instruments classified in shareholders' equity. Disclosures include

tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is more likely-than-not to be realized from future
operations. The Company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against all available income tax loss carry forwards.
The Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it
is more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance is reviewed annually. When
circumstances change and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets
 the
impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.


 2015 and 2014
 the Company
has no unrecognized income tax benefits. The Company&#146;s policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized
income tax benefits is to include such items as tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recorded during the year ended
