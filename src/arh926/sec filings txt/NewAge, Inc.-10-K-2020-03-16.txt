 information concerning:



    
    
Anticipated
    operating results
 including revenue and earnings.

predict all risks
 nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor
 or combination
of factors
 may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make.
In light of these risks
 uncertainties and assumptions
 the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Report
may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking
statements.

Business
Overview

We
are a healthy beverages and lifestyles company engaged in the development and commercialization of a portfolio of organic
 natural
and other better-for-you healthy beverages
 liquid dietary supplements
 cannabidiol (&ldquo;CBD&rdquo;) topical products
 and
other healthy lifestyle products. We compete in the growth segments of the beverage industry as a leading one-stop shop supplier
for major retailers and distributors. We also are one of a few companies that commercializes its business across multiple channels
including traditional retail
 ecommerce
 direct to consumer
 and medical channels. We offer liquid dietary supplement products
including Tahitian Noni&reg; Juice
 through a direct-to-consumer model using independent distributors (called independent product
consultants or &ldquo;IPCs&rdquo;). We market a full portfolio of Ready-to-Drink (&ldquo;RTD&rdquo;) better-for-you beverages
including competitive offerings in the kombucha
 tea
 yerba mate
 coffee
 functional waters
 relaxation drinks
 energy drinks
rehydrating beverages
 and functional medical beverage segments. We differentiate our brands through functional performance characteristics
and ingredients
 and offer many products that are 100% organic and natural
 with no high-fructose corn syrup (&ldquo;HFCS&rdquo;)
no genetically modified organisms (&ldquo;GMOs&rdquo;)
 no preservatives
 and only natural flavors
 fruits
 and ingredients. We
rank among the largest healthy-beverage companies in the world as well as one of the fastest growing beverage companies according
to Beverage Industry Magazine annual rankings and Markets and Markets. Our goal is to become the world&rsquo;s leading healthy
beverage company
 with leading brands for consumers
 leading growth for retailers and distributors
 and leading return on investment
for shareholders. Our target market is health conscious consumers
 who are becoming more interested and better educated on what
is included in their diets
 causing them to shift towards alternative beverage choices and away from less healthy options such
as carbonated soft drinks or other high caloric beverages. We believe consumer awareness of the benefits of healthier lifestyles
and the availability of heathier beverages is rapidly accelerating worldwide
 and we are seeking to capitalize on that shift.

Corporate
History

New
Age Beverages Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington in April 2010 under the name American Brewing
Company
 Inc. (&ldquo;American Brewing&rdquo;). On April 1
 2015
 American Brewing acquired the assets of B&amp;R Liquid Adventure
which included the brand B&uacute;cha&reg; Live Kombucha. Prior to acquiring the B&uacute;cha&reg; Live Kombucha brand and business
we were a craft brewery operation. In October 2015
 we sold the American Brewing division
 including its brewery and related assets
to focus exclusively on healthy beverages. In April 2016
 new management assumed daily operation of the business
 and began the
implementation of a new vision for the Company. In May 2016 we changed our corporate name to B&uacute;cha
 Inc. (&ldquo;B&uacute;cha&rdquo;)
and then on June 30
 2016
 we acquired the combined assets of Xing Beverage
 LLC
 New Age Beverages
 LLC
 Aspen Pure
 LLC
 and
New Age Properties. We then shut down all California operations where B&uacute;cha was based
 relocated the Company&rsquo;s operational
headquarters to Denver
 Colorado and changed our name to New Age Beverages Corporation.

In
February 2017
 we up-listed to the Nasdaq Capital Market (&ldquo;Nasdaq&rdquo;). In March 2017
 we acquired the assets of Maverick
Brands
 including its brand Coco Libre&reg;. In June 2017
 we acquired the assets of Premier Micronutrient Corporation (&ldquo;PMC&rdquo;)
and also completed the acquisition of Marley Beverage Company (&ldquo;Marley&rdquo;) including the brand licensing rights to Marley&reg;
brand RTD beverages.

On
December 21
 2018
 we completed a business combination with Morinda
 whereby Morinda became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
Morinda is a Utah-based healthy lifestyles and beverage company founded in 1996 with operations in more than 60 countries around
the world
 and manufacturing operations in Tahiti
 the U.S.
 China
 Japan
 and Germany. Morinda was the first company to commercially
globally sell products derived from the noni plant
 an antioxidant-rich
 natural resource found in French Polynesia. Morinda is
primarily a direct-to-consumer and ecommerce business working with approximately 280
000 independent contractor IPCs and customers
worldwide. More than 60% of its business is generated in the key Asia Pacific markets of Japan
 China
 Korea
 Taiwan
 and Indonesia.
The combination with Morinda provided the Company with an augmented portfolio of healthy beverages
 with multi-channel penetration
spanning traditional retail
 ecommerce
 and in-home
 and hybrid route-to-market spanning direct-store-delivery (&ldquo;DSD&rdquo;)
wholesale
 and direct-to-consumer.


    
    


On
July 10
 2019
 we completed a business combination with Brands Within Reach
 LLC (&ldquo;BWR&rdquo;) whereby BWR became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. BWR owns key licensing and distribution rights in the United States for some of the world&rsquo;s leading
beverage brands including Nestea&reg;
 Volvic&reg;
 Evian&reg; and Illy&reg; Ready-to-Drink Coffee. We have established our new
North American operations location at BWR&rsquo;s leased facility north of New York City in Mamaroneck
 New York.

We
have four direct subsidiaries
 all of which are wholly-owned. These subsidiaries consist of Morinda (doing business as
Noni by NewAge)
 BWR
 NABC
 Inc.
 and NABC Properties
 LLC (&ldquo;NABC Properties&rdquo;). NABC
 Inc. is a
Colorado-based operating company that consolidates performance and financial results of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries and
divisions. NABC Properties administers a building owned by New Age in southern Colorado. We previously had a subsidiary

Age Health Sciences
 Inc.
 that was merged with and into NABC in November 2019.

For
the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 our operating segments have consisted of the Morinda segment and the NewAge segment.
We recently announced that Morinda has begun doing business as Noni by NewAge
 thereby refocusing on the rich Tahitian heritage
of our noni-based product offerings and cinching the tie with New Age Beverages. As a result of this change
 throughout this Report
we refer to our former Morinda segment as the Noni by NewAge segment of our business.

The
Noni by NewAge segment is engaged in the development
 manufacturing
 and marketing of Tahitian Noni&reg; Juice
 MAX and other
noni beverages as well as other nutritional
 cosmetic and personal care products. The Noni by NewAge segment has manufacturing
operations in Tahiti
 Germany
 Japan
 the United States
 and China. The Noni by NewAge products are sold and distributed in more
than 60 countries using IPC&rsquo;s through its direct to consumer selling network and e-commerce business model. Approximately
80% of the net revenue of the Noni by NewAge segment is generated in the key Asia Pacific markets of Japan
 China
 Korea
 Taiwan
and Indonesia.

The
NewAge segment manufactures
 markets and sells a portfolio of healthy beverage brands including Xing&reg; Tea
 Marley
 B&uacute;cha&reg;
Live Kombucha
 Coco-Libre&reg;
 Evian&reg; and Volvic&reg;. These products are distributed through the Company&rsquo;s DSD network
and a hybrid of other routes to market throughout the United States and in 15 countries around the world. The NewAge brands are
sold in all channels of distribution including hypermarkets
 supermarkets
 pharmacies
 convenience
 gas and other outlets.

Principal
Products

Our
core business is developing
 marketing
 selling
 and distributing healthy liquid dietary supplements and ready-to-drink beverages.
The beverage industry comprises $1 trillion in annual revenue according to Euromonitor and Booz &amp; Company and is highly competitive
with three to four major multibillion-dollar multinational companies dominating the sector. We compete by differentiating our
brands as healthier and better-for-you alternatives that are natural
 organic
 have no artificial ingredients or sweeteners
 or
a combination of those features. Our brands include Tahitian Noni&reg; Juice
 TruAge&reg;
 Xing&reg; Tea
 Aspen Pure&reg;
 Marley&reg;
B&uacute;cha&reg; Live Kombucha
 PediaAde&trade;
 Coco Libre&reg;
 BioShield&trade;
 and &lsquo;NHANCED&trade; Recovery
 all competing
in the beverage industry. Noni by NewAge also has several additional consumer product offerings
 including a TeMana&reg; line
of skin care and lip products
 a Noni + Collagen ingestible skincare product
 Noni + CBD
 and wellness supplements.

Sales
and Marketing

We
market our RTD beverage products using a range of marketing media
 including in-store merchandising and promotions
 experiential
marketing
 events
 and sponsorships
 digital marketing and social media
 direct marketing
 and traditional media including print
radio
 outdoor
 and TV.

We
currently have an in-house sales and merchandising team consisting of approximately 75 people throughout the United States
 whose
compensation is variable and performance-based. Each salesperson has individual targets for increasing &ldquo;base&rdquo; volume
through distribution expansion
 and &ldquo;incremental&rdquo; volume through promotions and other in-store merchandising and display
activity. As distribution to new major customers
 new major channels
 or new major markets increases
 we will expand the sales
and marketing team on a variable basis.

We
use a direct selling model to market our Tahitian Noni and TeMana products through and to approximately 280
000 IPCs and customers
in over 60 countries around the world. Noni by NewAge has offices and employees in 25 countries to motivate
 educate
 and assist
IPCs in their efforts.


    
    




Our
products are currently distributed in over 60 countries
 and in all 50 U.S. states through a hybrid of four routes to market (including
our own DSD system that reaches more than 6
000 outlets) and to more than 35
000 other outlets throughout the United States&mdash;directly
through customers&rsquo; warehouses
 through our network of DSD partners and through our network of brokers and distributors.
Our products are sold through multiple channels including major grocery retail
 natural food retail
 specialty outlets
 hypermarkets
club stores
 pharmacies
 convenience stores and gas stations&mdash;and direct to consumers through individual independent distributor
IPCs and e-commerce.

Our
sales strategy seeks to distribute our products worldwide to consumers in the most cost-efficient method possible. We sell our
products direct to consumers through IPC&rsquo;s and our own ecommerce system and other ecommerce systems
 through retail customers
across grocery
 gas
 convenience
 pharmacy
 mass
 club and other channels
 to major foodservice customers
 to alternative channel
customers including juice/smoothie shops
 military
 office
 and health clubs
 and through hospitals
 outpatient doctor offices
and other channels.

Direct-to-Consumer
Distribution of Tahitian Noni
 TruAge
 TeMana
 and Other Products

Independent
Product Consultants (&ldquo;IPCs&rdquo;)

People
who wish to sell Noni by NewAge branded products (including Tahitian Noni and TeMana) through our person-to-person sales model
must enroll as IPCs in our independent sales force. New IPCs are sponsored by an existing IPC
 and the new IPC becomes a member
of the sponsoring IPC&rsquo;s sales organization. Newly enrolled IPCs must sign a written agreement or alternatively accept the
terms and conditions of the agreement online at the Company&rsquo;s website. The agreement requires all IPCs to comply with the
Noni by NewAge policies and procedures
 including that IPCs will: (i) safeguard and protect the reputation of the Company and
its products; (ii) refrain from any deceptive
 false
 unethical
 or unlawful consumer or recruiting practices; (iii) refrain from
any deceptive
 false
 unethical
 or unlawful claims about the Company&rsquo;s products or compensation plan; and (iv) refrain
from promoting or selling products that are competitive to the Company&rsquo;s flagship products
 or promoting other network marketing
opportunities to IPCs whom they did not personally sponsor with the Company. The Company may take disciplinary action (up to and
including termination of an IPCs purchase and sales organization rights) if an IPC violates these policies and procedures. In
many markets
 IPCs must purchase a nominally-priced starter kit (approximately $35) which includes sales and educational materials.
No commissions are paid on the purchase of a starter kit. The Company policies and procedures manual is available to IPCs in this
kit as well as online at the Company&rsquo;s website. No investment or product inventory purchase is required to become an IPC.

After
enrolling
 IPCs may purchase products directly at wholesale (member) pricing for resale to their customers as well as for personal
use. IPCs may build sales organizations by sponsoring and enrolling new IPCs. As IPCs sponsor others
 generational levels are
created in the IPC&rsquo;s organizational structure (referred to as a &ldquo;downline&rdquo;). As these IPCs continue to sponsor
others
 their sales organization forms a part of the greater sales organization of the upline sponsors. We have no requirements
for IPCs to sponsor new IPCs
 and IPCs are not compensated for recruiting or sponsoring others. All IPC compensation is based
on product sales of that IPC and part of their downline organization. Subject to payment of a nominal annual renewal fee (which
is waived for active sales activity of an IPC at the time of renewal)
 IPCs may continue to purchase our products at member pricing
and establish a sales organization while in compliance with our policies and procedures.

Although
our global compensation plan is designed generally to permit IPCs to establish downlines without country or border limitations
our business and compensation plan for China must be executed in a modified form due to Chinese laws and regulations. Only individuals
who are residents of China and are eligible to work there may enroll as IPCs or as customers in China. The same general policies
and procedures described above
 modified for China
 apply to IPCs in China. According to Chinese regulations
 non-China residents
are not permitted to sponsor IPCs in China
 or otherwise participate in the compensation plan for China.

IPC
Training and Motivation

An
IPC&rsquo;s sponsor provides the initial training about our products and compensation plan. Other IPCs in the sponsor&rsquo;s
sales organization typically assist with this training. Our policies require that a sponsor must maintain an ongoing professional
leadership association with IPCs in their sales organization. We develop training materials and sales tools to assist IPCs with
this training and in building their sales organizations. We also conduct online trainings and webinars
 regional
 national
 and
international IPC events
 as well as intensive leadership training events. Attendance at these events is voluntary
 and IPCs may
attend the events that they feel will most benefit them and their sales organization. We have found that the most successful and
productive IPCs tend to be those who take advantage of these events. While Noni by NewAge employees work to support the IPCs and
to provide them with training materials and sales tools
 we rely on our IPCs to operate as the sales force for Noni by NewAge
and to sell products
 sponsor new IPCs and customers to sell and purchase our products
 and to train new IPCs regarding our products
and compensation plan.


    
    


IPC
Compensation

Our
compensation plan has several attractive features and provides several opportunities for IPCs to earn compensation. IPCs understand
that success comes from the effort
 dedication
 resources
 and time they commit to their business. The compensation opportunities
require that IPCs consistently work at building
 training
 and retaining their sales organizations to sell our products to consumers.
Each compensation opportunity is designed to reward dedicated IPCs for directly and indirectly generating product sales through
their sales organization and to consumers. All compensation is conditioned on the IPC&rsquo;s good standing and compliance with
the Company&rsquo;s policies and procedures and the laws of the country where the IPC does business

The
integration of our compensation plan across international markets (except China) allows IPCs to earn commissions from global product
sales along with local product sales. We believe our compensation plan is one of the most attractive and lucrative offered by
any direct selling company&mdash;and is thus a significant aspect of our ability to expand internationally.



Noni
by NewAge also has a customer program. Individuals may enroll as customers and purchase products for their personal use only.
Customers do not resell or distribute our products. The customer program allows us to include individuals who wish to use our
products but who do not wish to participate in the business. Customers are not eligible to earn commissions. Customers may upgrade
their account at any time to become an IPC to then participate in the business and compensation plan and be eligible to earn commissions.

Manufacturing
and Distribution

Our
manufacturing and bottling facilities are in American Fork
 Utah; Mataiea
 Tahiti; Chongqing
 China; and Alamosa
 Colorado
 with
contract manufacturing and bottling in Tokyo
 Japan; 
 Germany; and
ten other facilities throughout the US. Each of our products are produced to exacting specifications and standards
 and subject
to strict quality control procedures.

Our
Coco Libre brand of coconut water is sourced from young coconuts on the southeastern coast of Vietnam
 which we believe produces
the sweetest and most complex flavored coconut water of any major competitor. Xing
 B&uacute;cha
 and Marley products are produced
using our proprietary blends and production processes.

Our
noni fruit is harvested from noni trees on 18 islands of French Polynesia by approximately 2
000 harvesters
 who are independent
contractors
 and who work and coordinate with Company representatives on each island. All fruit is checked at the time of harvest
for quality
 maturity
 and purity. To date
 we have maintained good relations with our suppliers and have not experienced any
significant difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of the noni fruit.

The
noni fruit is then shipped to our 85
000 square foot processing plant in Mataiea
 Tahiti
 where the fruit is again checked before
being processed. This facility
 as well as all facilities that produce products for us
 adheres to the Good Manufacturing Practices
as established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;). The Tahiti facility is well-maintained
 and the buildings
and equipment are kept clean and in good repair and technology is up to date. The facility is regularly inspected by the French
Polynesian authorities and by the FDA.

At
this processing facility
 the seeds are separated from the fruit. The seeds are later processed for oil extraction. The fruit
is extensively inspected
 pasteurized
 and turned into puree
 which is the key component of our Tahitian Noni Juice. The pasteurized
puree is checked for quality and hermetically sealed in tote bins which are shipped by sea to ports in the United States
 Japan
China and Germany for manufacturing our products. Each day the equipment used at this facility is automatically cleaned by a three
step clean-in-place (&ldquo;CIP&rdquo;) system. This system ensures the cleanliness of the equipment
 tanks
 and pipes used in
the processing of the puree.

Reliance
on Third-Party Suppliers and Distributors

Except
as noted above
 we rely on various suppliers for the raw and packaging materials
 production
 sale
 and distribution of our products.
Third-party distributors cover places outside of our owned DSD distribution network. The material terms of these relationships
are typically negotiated annually and include pricing
 quality standards
 delivery times and conditions
 purchase orders
 and
payment terms. Payment terms are typically net 30
 meaning that the total invoiced amount is expected to be paid in full within
30 days from the date the products or services are provided. We believe that we have sufficient options for each of our raw and
packaging material needs
 as well as our third-party distribution needs and also have long-term relationships with our suppliers
and distributors
 resulting in consistency in quality and supply. We also believe that we have sufficient breadth of retail relationships
with distribution in both large and small retailers and independents and across multiple channels (mass
 club
 pharmacies
 convenience
and small and large format retailers) throughout the United States.


    
    


The
contractual arrangements with third parties
 including suppliers
 manufacturers
 distributors
 and retailers are typical of the
beverage industry with standard terms. We have no long-term obligations with third party suppliers
 manufacturers
 distributors
and retailers
 nor do any of them have long-term obligations with us. The third-party supplier
 manufacturing and distribution
agreements were entered into in the normal course of business within the guidelines of industry practices and are not deemed material
and definite.



The
beverage industry
 specifically the healthy beverage industry
 and the direct selling industries are multi-billion-dollar industries
which are highly competitive. We face intense competition from very large
 international corporations and from local and national
companies. In addition
 we face competition from well-known companies that have large market share. We also face stiff competition
to engage IPCs that sell our direct-to-consumer products.

The
intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase.

Many
of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories
 significantly greater financial
and operational resources
 and have more name recognition than we have. However
 we believe that
 with our diverse product line
consisting of noni juice
 TeMana Products
 kombucha tea
 green tea
 water
 energy beverages
 and new CBD-infused beverages
 we
will have the ability to compete effectively in the industry and increase our market share.

Research
and Development Activities

Our
mission to only provide healthy functional beverages with real efficacy for consumers governs our development efforts. Our research
and development (&ldquo;R&amp;D&rdquo;) efforts are focused on two primary paths. The first is to continually review our existing
formulas and production processes and structure to evaluate opportunities for cost of goods sold improvements
 without degrading
the quality or fundamentally changing the consumer appeal taste profile of our existing products. The second is in the development
of fundamentally new and differentiated products
 based on consumer insights and trends and competitive opportunities.

Our
new products and R&amp;D efforts in our Health Sciences Division are science-backed by the patents
 cooperative research studies
and human and animal trials acquired from PMC. They are targeted toward fundamental human needs
 segments that do not yet exist
in beverages but do exist in the pharmaceutical arena
 and opportunities where NewAge can gain first mover advantage. A guiding
principle of &ldquo;no compromise&rdquo; governs our development efforts.

Noni
by NewAge has an R&amp;D group that is closely aligned with and supports the goals and plans of the Company. In addition to developing
new healthy and scientifically sound products and reviewing and improving existing formulas and processes for cost reductions
Noni by NewAge R&amp;D continues to conduct and publish new
 cutting edge benefits research on noni and other new products. R&amp;D
is an integral part of the global corporate structure providing timely technical
 regulatory
 quality
 processing and scientific
standards
 data
 and expertise as needed and requested. Noni by NewAge R&amp;D
 in partnership with other departments
 maintains
an extensive intellectual property database of patents
 publications
 formulations and ideas that help protect and keep the Company
in the forefront of healthy beverage offerings and product development. Noni by NewAge R&amp;D administers laboratories that provide
analytical
 chemical
 microbiological
 nutritional
 and biochemical capabilities. We believe that we own the only lab in the world
dedicated to the study of the noni plant and pioneering new innovative applications for noni.

Patents
and Trademarks

We
hold numerous issued U.S. patents and trademarks and have rights to additional U.S. patents under license agreements. We also
hold issued patents and trademarks in other countries. In addition
 we have pending U.S. and international patent applications
that cover numerous inventions. We also maintain trademarks in the U.S. and other countries as well as pending trademark applications
in the U.S. and other countries and have rights to additional U.S. and international trademarks under license agreements.

We
also rely on trade secrets and unpatented know how to protect our proprietary technology and may be vulnerable to competitors
who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how.


    
    


Government
and Industry Regulation

We
are required to comply
 and it is our policy to comply
 with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world
in which we do business. In the United States
 the safety
 production
 transportation
 distribution
 advertising
 labeling and
sale of our Company&rsquo;s products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act; the Federal
Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal
 state and local workplace health
and safety laws; various federal
 state and local environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; and
various other federal
 state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States
 our business is subject to numerous
similar statutes and regulations
 as well as other legal and regulatory requirements.

Under
a California law known as Proposition 65
 if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction
a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance
 unless the conditions of
an exemption (described below) can be met. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances
to these lists. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement
of a warning label. However
 Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the
use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:



    
    
below
    a &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; threshold that may be established;

    
    
naturally
    occurring;

    
    
the
    result of necessary cooking; or

    
    
subject
    to another applicable exemption.


One
or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists
 or that may be added in the future
 can be detected in certain
Company products at low levels that are safe. With respect to substances that have not yet been listed under Proposition 65
 the
Company takes the position that listing is not scientifically justified. With respect to substances that are already listed
 the
Company takes the position that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption
from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. The state of California and other
parties
 however
 have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future.

We
use nonrefillable recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world. We also offer and use
refillable containers
 which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas
requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale
 marketing and use of certain beverage
containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage
container deposits
 recycling
 ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and
overseas. We anticipate that additional such legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local
 state and federal
levels
 both in the United States and elsewhere.

Our
facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection
statutes and regulations
 including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is
to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had
 and we do not expect such compliance
to have
 any material adverse effect on our Company&rsquo;s capital expenditures
 net income
 or competitive position.

We
are also subject to various federal
 state and international laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection
 including
the European Union&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;)
 which became effective in May 2018
 and the
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;)
 which became effective on January 1
 2020. The interpretation and
application of data privacy and data protection laws and regulations are often uncertain and are evolving in the United States
and internationally. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain their relevance to and
potential impact on our business and develop strategies to address regulatory trends and developments
 including any required
changes to our privacy and data protection compliance programs and policies.



Sales
of our beverages are somewhat seasonal
 with the peak summer months accounting for a higher level of sales. Our net revenue during
the second and third quarters of the year has historically accounted for approximately 60% of annual revenue
 and this seasonality
is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.


    
    




As
of December 31
 2019
 we had 934 employees globally
 including 28 that worked for us on a part time basis. We also engage temporary
employees and consultants as needed. We have not experienced any work stoppages
 and we consider our relations with our employees
to be very good.

Item
1A - Risk Factors

Our
business
 financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows are subject to a number of risk factors that may adversely
affect our business
 financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows. If any significant adverse developments resulting
from these risk factors should occur
 the trading price of our securities could decline
 and moreover
 investors in our securities
could lose all or part of their investment in our securities.

You
should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements under &ldquo;Special Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.&rdquo; All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described
below.

Risks
Related to our Business
 Operations
 and Industry

We
have incurred losses to date and will likely continue to incur losses.

We
have incurred net losses since we commenced operations. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 our net losses were $89.8
million and $12.1 million
 respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $112.5 million as of December 31
 2019. Our cumulative
net losses have had
 and likely will continue to have
 a material adverse effect on our working capital
 assets
 and stockholders&rsquo;
equity. We will likely continue to incur losses in the future and may never generate revenue sufficient to become profitable or
to sustain profitability. Continuing losses may impair our ability to raise the additional capital required to continue and expand
our operations. Risks to our operating results include those that may be caused by the spread of coronavirus
 including absences
affecting manufacturing and sales force personnel leading to reduced customer purchasing activity.

We
may be unable to comply with the financial covenants in our loan agreement with our senior lender
 East West Bank.

Our
loan agreement with East West Bank (&ldquo;EWB&rdquo;) imposes various obligations and financial covenants on us. Borrowings bear
interest at a variable interest rate and are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. In addition
 the loan agreement
limits our ability to dispose of all or any part of our business or property; merge or consolidate with or into any other business
organization; incur or prepay additional indebtedness; declare or pay any dividend or make a distribution on any class of our
stock; or enter into specified material transactions with our affiliates.

As
of December 31
 2019
 we were not in compliance with the minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant under the EWB loan agreement. While
EWB waived non-compliance with this covenant and agreed to less stringent covenants in the future
 we were required to provide
several concessions that will impact our future liquidity and capital resources. Whenever we request a waiver or amendment
 there
is a risk that the lender will not grant the request or will demand concessions that increase our interest costs and improve the
lenders security in the event of a future default. For example
 when we entered into the third amendment with EWB in March 2020
we agreed to (i) increase the interest rate by 1.5%
 (ii) set aside $15.1 million in restricted cash accounts controlled by EWB
and (iii) raise at least $30.0 million through equity financings for the year ending December 31
 2020. Despite the less
stringent covenants in the third amendment
 if our financial performance does not improve
 additional covenant violations may
occur. There is no assurance that EWB will waive future instances of noncompliance.

Failure
to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business.

If
we cannot provide reliable financial reports
 our operating results could be harmed. All internal control systems
 no matter how
well designed
 have inherent limitations. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Based on our evaluation as of September 30
 2019
we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as a result of inadequate controls over the preparation
and review of our consolidated statements of cash flows. While this material weakness was remediated in the fourth quarter of
2019
 it is possible that we will have additional material weaknesses in the future. A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a
combination of control deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Any failure to implement required new or improved controls
 or difficulties encountered in their implementation
 could harm our
operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal
control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information
 which could have a material
adverse effect on our stock price. Failure to maintain our internal controls could also potentially subject us to sanctions or
investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.


    
    


Growth
of operations will depend on the acceptance of our products and consumer discretionary spending.

The
acceptance of our healthy beverage and better-for-you products by both consumers and by retailers to gain distribution is critically
important to our success. Our business could be harmed if there are shifts in retailer priorities and shifts in user preferences
away from our products
 and if we are unable to develop effective healthy beverage and better-for-you products that appeal to
both retailers and consumers. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary user spending
 which is influenced
by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. We may experience an inability to generate revenue
during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty
 where users may purchase products that are cheaper or forego purchasing
any healthy products. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our
sales
 results of operations
 business
 and financial condition.

Our
products may not become
 or continue to be
 appealing and
 as a result
 there may not be demand for these products and our sales
could decrease
 which would result in a loss of revenue. Additionally
 interest in our products may not continue
 which could
adversely affect our business and revenues.

Demand
for products we sell depends on many factors
 including the number of customers we are able to attract and retain over time
 the
competitive environment in the healthy beverage and better-for-you products industry
 as well as the beverage and retail industry
as a whole. Lack of demand may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending
 and
the inability to anticipate changes in user preferences and to meet consumers&rsquo; needs in a timely cost effective manner could
result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for the products we offer
 which could adversely affect our sales
cash flows and overall financial condition. An investor could lose his or her entire investment as a result.

Future
acquisitions
 strategic investments
 partnerships
 or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate
 divert the attention
of management
 disrupt our business
 dilute stockholder value
 and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We
may seek to acquire or invest in businesses and product lines that we believe could complement or expand our product offerings
or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause
us to incur various expenses in identifying
 investigating
 and pursuing suitable acquisitions
 whether or not the acquisitions
are completed. If we acquire businesses
 we may not be able to integrate successfully the acquired personnel
 operations
 and
technologies
 or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We may not be able to find and identify desirable
acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target or obtain adequate financing to
complete such acquisitions. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt
which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition
 if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations
 our
business
 financial condition
 and results of operations may be adversely affected.

A
substantial portion of our total assets are classified as long-lived assets that are subject to periodic impairment testing. If
we determine that impairment exists in the future
 it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Under
our accounting policies
 we consider whether events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate if it is &ldquo;more likely
than not&rdquo; that an impairment of our long-lived assets has occurred. We perform an annual goodwill impairment evaluation
during the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Evaluating whether impairment exists involves substantial judgment and estimation.
If we project a sustained decline in a reporting unit&rsquo;s revenues and earnings
 it will have a significant negative impact
on the fair value of the reporting unit which could result in material impairment charges in the future. Such a decline could
be driven by
 among other things: (i) changes in strategic priorities; (ii) anticipated decreases in product pricing
 sales volumes
and long-term growth rates as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; and (iii) the inability to achieve
 or delays
in achieving the goals of our strategic initiatives and synergies. Adverse changes to macroeconomic factors
 such as increases
to long-term interest rates
 would also negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units.

During
2019
 we determined that our long-lived assets were impaired for an aggregate of $47.2 million. As of December 31
 2019
 a substantial
portion of our total assets are long-lived assets that are subject to future impairment evaluations. Accordingly
 future impairment
charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

We
face strong and varied competition.

Our
products and industry as a whole are subject to strong and varied competition. Such competitors include: (1) large multinational
corporations in the beverage and healthy beverage industries
 including but not limited to companies that have established loyal
customer bases over several decades; (2) healthy beverage companies that have an established customer base
 and have the same
or a similar business plan as we do and may be looking to expand; (3) a variety of other local and national healthy beverage companies;
and (4) multinational corporations in the direct selling business that have large
 loyal independent distributor bases.



    
    


Many
of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories
 greater financial and operational
resources
 and greater name and brand recognition than we have. As a result
 these competitors may have greater credibility with
both existing and potential customers. They also may offer more products and more aggressively promote and sell their products.
Our competitors may also support more aggressive pricing than we can
 which could adversely affect sales
 cause us to decrease
our prices to remain competitive
 or otherwise reduce the overall gross profit earned on our products. We may be unable to develop
or sustain a market position or expand our business. We anticipate that the intensity of competition will increase.

If
we are unable to attract and retain active IPCs and customers in our direct-to-consumer business
 our business may be harmed.

We
distribute our Tahitian Noni
 TruAge
 and TeMana products through and to approximately 280
000 independent contractor IPCs and
customers
 and we depend upon them directly for a substantial amount of our revenue. To increase our revenue
 we must increase
the number of
 and the productivity of
 our IPCs. Thus
 our success in the Noni by NewAge segment depends in part upon our ability
to attract
 retain
 and motivate a large base of IPCs. We cannot accurately predict how the number and productivity of our IPCs
may fluctuate
 because we are relying primarily on our IPC leaders to recruit
 train
 and motivate new IPCs. Several related factors
affect retention and motivation
 including general business and economic conditions
 adverse publicity
 investigations or legal
proceedings
 government regulations or actions
 public perceptions about our products
 and other competing direct-to-consumer
companies that are larger than us and compete for a limited number of persons who desire to become independent distributors.

In
our direct-to-consumer business
MAX constitute a significant portion of our
sales.

Tahitian
Noni Juice and MAX constitute a significant portion of our Noni by NewAge segment sales
 accounting for approximately 82% and
85% of our net revenue in 2019 and 2018
 respectively. We face strong competition from other companies producing noni and
other superfruit products. If consumer demand for these products shifts or declines or our competitors are more successful in
the markets in which we do business
 our financial condition and operating results would be harmed.

We
depend on a limited number of suppliers of raw and packaging materials.

We
rely upon a limited number of suppliers for raw and packaging materials used to make and package our products. Our success depends
in part upon our ability to consistently obtain such materials at a quality that meets our requirements. The price and availability
of these materials are subject to market conditions. Increases in the price of our products due to the increase in the cost of
raw materials could have a negative effect on our business.

If
we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of raw and packaging materials
 delays or reductions in product shipments could occur which
would have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 and results of operations. The supply and price of
raw materials used to produce our products can be affected by several factors beyond our control
 such as frosts
 droughts
 other
weather conditions
 economic factors affecting growing decisions
 various plant diseases and pests
 transportation interruption
and foreign imposed restrictions. If any of the foregoing were to occur
 such condition may have a material adverse effect on
our business
 financial condition
 and results of operations. In addition
 our results of operations depend upon our ability to
accurately forecast our requirements of raw materials. Any failure by us to accurately forecast our demand for raw materials could
result in an inability to meet higher than anticipated demand for products or producing excess inventory
 either of which may
adversely affect our results of operations.

The
noni we use in our direct-to-consumer business is grown and harvested exclusively in French Polynesia. Noni fruit is the most
important raw material used in our Tahitian Noni and TeMana products
 and it is important to our success. If the government of
French Polynesia prohibited the exportation or use of noni
 or
 if we could not source noni fruit in French Polynesia in sufficient
quantities to meet demand for our products due to adverse weather
 natural disasters
 soil overuse
 labor shortages
 or any other
reason
 our financial condition and results would be harmed. Any adverse publicity regarding the quality of noni grown in French
Polynesia would also have an adverse impact on our results and financial condition.

We
depend on our noni processing plant in Tahiti.

Our
processing plant in Tahiti produces all the noni puree used in our Tahitian Noni Juice
 MAX
 and many other noni-based products.
Noni puree is sent to manufacturing facilities in American Fork
 Utah
 Japan
 Germany
 and China. As a result
 we are dependent
upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our processing plant in Tahiti. The Tahiti operation is subject to power failures
breakdown
 failure
 or substandard performance of equipment
 improper installation or operation of equipment
 natural or other
disasters
 labor strikes
 and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies
 including the FDA.
The occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility may have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition
 and results of operations.


    
    


We
depend on third party manufacturers for a portion of our business.

A
portion of our revenue is dependent on third party manufacturers that we do not control. The majority of these manufacturers&rsquo;
business comes from producing or selling either their own products or our competitors&rsquo; products. As independent companies
these manufacturers make their own business decisions. They may determine whether
 and to what extent
 they manufacture our products
our competitors&rsquo; products
 and their own products. They may devote more resources to other products or take other actions
detrimental to our brands. Usually they can terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us without cause. We may need to increase
support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them. Their financial condition
could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control
 and our business could suffer. Deteriorating economic conditions
could negatively affect the financial viability of third-party manufacturers. Any of these factors could negatively affect our
business and results of operations.

Failure
of third-party distributors upon which we rely could hurt our business.

We
rely heavily on third party distributors for the sale of our products to retailers. Our distributors may also provide distribution
services to competing brands
 and larger
 national or international brands
 and may be to varying degrees influenced by their
continued business relationships with other larger beverage
 and specifically
 healthy beverage companies. Our independent distributors
may be influenced by a large competitor if they rely on that competitor for a significant portion of their sales. Our distributors
may not continue to effectively market and distribute our products. The loss of any significant distributor or the inability to
replace a poorly performing distributor in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
and results of operations. Furthermore
 we may not successfully attract new distributors as they increase their presence in their
existing markets or expand into new markets.

We
may violate applicable government laws and regulations.

We
are subject to a variety of federal
 state
 and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries
 some of which are
rapidly changing or conflicting. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture
 safety
labeling
 transportation
 advertising
 and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture
 safety
labeling
 transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with
substantial penalties. In addition
 any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation
 or the introduction
of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations
 could cause increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For
example
 changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on our beverages and our ingredients could increase our
costs. Regulatory focus on the health
 safety and marketing of beverage products is increasing. Certain federal or state regulations
or laws affecting labeling our products
 such as California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prop 65
&rdquo; which requires warnings on any product
with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects
 are or could become applicable to our products.

In
certain jurisdictions
 these legal and regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance
with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations
 sanctions
 mandatory recalls
 enforcement actions
disgorgement of profits
 fines
 damages
 civil and criminal penalties or injunctions
 and may result in our inability to provide
certain products and services to prospective clients or clients. If any governmental sanctions are imposed
 or if we do not prevail
in any possible civil or criminal litigation
 or if customers make claims against us for compensation
 our business
 financial
condition
 and results of operations could be harmed. In addition
 responding to any action will likely result in a significant
diversion of management&rsquo;s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees and costs. Enforcement actions and
sanctions could further harm our business
 financial condition
 and results of operations.

Our
IPCs could violate marketing or advertising laws or regulations.

In
our direct-to-consumer business
 we sell through IPCs. Each IPC signs an agreement with Noni by NewAge agreeing to comply with
all our policies and procedures
 including without limitation our Policy Manual. Our policies prohibit false and misleading advertising
and making improper health and income claims. We require IPCs to clear all promotional materials in advance with our Compliance
Department. However
 despite our efforts
 occasionally IPCs violate our policies and publish inappropriate marketing materials
describing our products or programs. It is impossible to monitor all social media outlets and all IPC communications. Our Compliance
Department takes commercially reasonable means
 including a computer program that actively searches for improper advertising
to find improper IPC advertising&mdash;and when we find such advertising
 we require the IPC to correct it. Some such promotional
communications have lingered for years in obscure places on the internet and
 by the time we find them
 the IPC is no longer affiliated
with us and is not cooperative in removing the offending advertising. These violations by IPCs could lead to actions against us
by regulatory agencies
 states&rsquo; attorney generals
 and private parties and could have an adverse impact on our business
financial condition
 and operational results.


    
    


Our
proposed CBD product line is subject to varying
 and rapidly changing laws
 regulations
 administrative practices
 enforcement
approaches
 judicial interpretations
 and consumer perceptions and we may be unable to commercialize or CBD infused beverages

We
have announced the launch of a new product line consisting of CBD-infused beverages. Our intention is to commercialize the new
line of beverages when legally permitted in local markets. In February 2020
 we launched a CBD beverage shot in Japan. However
in Japan
 the U.S. and elsewhere the CBD and cannabis industry is evolving and subject to varying
 and rapidly changing laws
regulations
 administrative practices
 enforcement approaches
 judicial interpretations
 and consumer perceptions. For example
the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removes hemp from the Controlled Substances Act and permits the production and marketing
of hemp and derivatives of cannabis with less than 0.3 percent concentrations of THC. However
 in a 2019 statement from Scott
Gottlieb
 then FDA Commissioner
 the Commissioner reemphasized its agency&rsquo;s authority and intent to regulate products containing
cannabis or cannabis derived compounds under the Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act and Section 351 of the Public Health Service
Act. We do not market or sell CBD beverages in the U.S. and do not intend to market or sell CBD ingestible products in the U.S.
until we can do so in compliance with applicable laws.

Our
ongoing investment in new product lines and products and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our ongoing businesses.

We
have invested and expect to continue to invest in new product lines
 products
 and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant
risks and uncertainties
 including distraction of management from current operations
 insufficient revenues to offset liabilities
assumed and expenses associated with these new investments
 inadequate return of capital on our investments and unidentified issues
not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings. Because these new ventures are inherently risky
 such strategies
and offerings may not be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation
 financial condition
 and operating results.

We
depend on attracting
 retaining
 developing
 and motivating key personnel
 including a small number of key management personnel
and losing them could hurt our business.

Our
success depends on our ability to attract
 retain
 develop
 and motivate highly qualified personnel. In addition
 we rely on a
small number of key individuals to manage our business and operations. We do not carry key person insurance covering members of
management. The competition for qualified personnel for our industry is intense. We will need to hire additional personnel as
we continue to expand. We may not attract
 retain
 and develop quality personnel on acceptable terms due to the competition for
such personnel
 which could have an adverse effect on our business operations
 financial condition and operating results.

We
need to attract and retain talented employees.

Success
in the beverage industry
 specifically as it relates to our healthy functional beverage products
 does and will continue to require
highly talented and experienced employees. Due to the growth in this market segment
 such personnel and the talent and experience
they possess is in high demand. We may be unable to attract and retain these employees. If we fail to attract
 train
 motivate
and retain talented personnel
 our business
 financial condition
 and operating results may be materially and adversely impacted.

We
face various operating hazards that could result in the reduction of our operations.

Our
operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks
 such as defective
 contaminated
 or damaged products. The occurrence
of such a problem could result in a costly product recall and serious damage to our reputation for product quality
 and potential
lawsuits. Although we maintain insurance against certain risks under various general liability and product liability insurance
policies
 our insurance may not be adequate to fully cover any incidents of product contamination or injuries resulting from our
operations and our products
 or damages to reputation and goodwill. We may not be able to continue to maintain insurance with
adequate coverage for liabilities or risks arising from our business operations on acceptable terms. Even if the insurance is
adequate
 insurance premiums could increase significantly which could result in higher costs to us.


    
    


Events
such as severe weather conditions
 natural disasters
 regional and global epidemics
 government policies and treaties
 hostilities
and social unrest
 among others
 can adversely affect our results and prospects.

Severe
weather conditions
 natural disasters
 hostilities and social unrest
 any shifting climate patterns
 terrorist activities
 health
epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them)
 including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus
first identified in Wuhan
 Hubei Province
 China in December 2019 that has spread to North America and Europe
 and changes in
government policies and treaties can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and product supply availability
and costs
 as well as the local operations in impacted markets
 all of which can affect our results and prospects. The recent
outbreak of the coronavirus has recently become a pandemic
 and neither the duration nor scope of the disruption can be predicted.
Therefore
 while we expect this outbreak to negatively impact our results
 the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated
at this time.

Substantial
disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur.

A
disruption in production at our beverage manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition
a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers
 bottlers
 or distributors. The disruption could
occur for many reasons
 including fire
 natural disasters
 weather
 water scarcity
 manufacturing problems
 disease
 strikes
transportation or supply interruption
 government regulation
 cybersecurity attacks or terrorism. Alternative facilities with
sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available
 may cost substantially more
 or may take a significant time to start
production
 each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.

We
are subject to seasonality related to sales of our products.

Our
business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically
 a significant portion of our net revenue and net earnings has been
realized during the period from May through September. Accordingly
 our operating results may vary significantly from quarter
to quarter. Our operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of any other results. If our sales
were to be substantially below seasonal norms
 our annual revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected.

Litigation
and publicity concerning product quality
 health
 and other issues could adversely affect our results of operations
 business
and financial condition.

Our
business could be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from product
defects or contamination
 operations
 workplace inspections
 alleged data breaches
 or other issues. Adverse publicity about these
allegations may negatively affect us
 whether or not the allegations are true
 by discouraging customers from buying our products.
We could also incur significant liabilities if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us
 or litigation costs
 regardless
of the result. Further
 any litigation may distract our key employees or cause them to expend resources and time normally devoted
to the operation of our business.

We
have experienced significant growth resulting in changes to our organization and structure
 which if not effectively managed
could have a negative impact on our business.

Our
headcount and operations have grown substantially in recent years. We increased the number of full-time employees over the past
two years from 172 employees on December 31
 2017 to 934 employees on December 31
 2019. We believe that our corporate culture
has been a critical component of our success. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team and nurturing
our culture. As we expand our business and operate as a public company
 we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture
while managing our employee growth. Any failure to manage our anticipated growth and related organizational changes to preserve
our culture could negatively affect growth and achievement of our business objectives.

In
addition
 our organizational structure has become more complex because of our significant growth. We have added employees and
may need to continue to scale and adapt our operational
 financial
 and management controls
 and our reporting systems and procedures.
The expansion of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit additional financial
 operational
 and management resources
before our revenue increases and with no assurances that our revenue will increase. If we fail to manage our growth
 we likely
will be unable to execute our business strategy
 which could have a negative impact on our business
 financial condition
 and
results of operations.


    
    


Our
ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.

We
have incurred net operating losses (&ldquo;NOLs&rdquo;) for U.S. income tax purposes during our history. If we continue to generate
taxable losses
 unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income until such unused losses expire. Under Internal
Revenue Code (&ldquo;Code&rdquo;) Section 382
 if a corporation undergoes an &ldquo;ownership change
&rdquo; generally defined
as a greater than 50 percent change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period
 the corporation&rsquo;s
ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards
 or NOLs
 (and other pre-change tax attributes as applicable) to
offset its post change income may be limited. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership
changes and/or subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). If we generate net taxable
income
 our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset such taxable income could be subject to limitations. Similar provisions
of state tax law may also apply. Even if we attain profitability
 we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOL&rsquo;s
and other tax attributes. We have performed a preliminary Section 382 analysis. The preliminary calculations indicate that the
Company&rsquo;s NOLs do not appear to be subject to the limitation.

Our
business is susceptible to risks associated with global operations.

We
have subsidiaries with offices in 25 countries and sales in 60 countries. This provides access to international markets both for
our Noni by NewAge products and for our traditional NewAge product line. Our current global operations and future initiatives
involve a variety of risks
 including:



    
    
changes
    in a specific country&rsquo;s or region&rsquo;s political or economic conditions


    
    
natural
    disasters and outbreak of disease
 including the recent and ongoing outbreak and spreading of coronavirus
 political and economic
    instability
 including wars
 terrorism and political unrest
 boycotts
 curtailment of trade and other business restrictions


    
    
changes
    in regulatory requirements
 taxes
 currency control laws
 or trade laws


    
    
more
    stringent regulations relating to data security (e.g.
 the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR))
 such as where and
    how data can be housed
 accessed
 and used
 and the unauthorized use of
 or access to
 commercial and personal information


    
    
differing
    labor regulations
 especially in countries and geographies where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as
    compared to the United States
 including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations


    
    
challenges
    inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances
 including the need to implement
    systems
 policies
 benefits
 and compliance programs


    
    
increased
    travel
 real estate
 infrastructure
 and legal compliance costs associated with global operations


    
    
currency
    exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses
 and the cost and risk of entering into hedging
    transactions if we do so


    
    
limitations
    on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries


    
    
laws
    and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors


    
    
limited
    or insufficient intellectual property protection


    
    
political
    instability or terrorist activities


    
    
exposure
    to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws
 including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
    similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions


    
    
treaties
    or lack of treaties between countries
 and change of government structures (such as the UK leaving the European Union) or
    government withdrawals from trade agreements (such as NAFTA)
 and

    
    
adverse
    tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.


If
we are not able to successfully address the risks that may arise in connection with a global business
 our financial condition
and business result will be adversely affected.


    
    


Economic
uncertainties or downturns in the general economy could disproportionately affect the demand for our products and services and
negatively affect our results of operations.

General
worldwide economic conditions have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years
 and market volatility and uncertainty
remain widespread. During challenging economic times
 our distribution customers may face issues with their cash flows and in
gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on reasonable terms
 which could impair their ability to pay us
and adversely affect our revenue. If such conditions occur
 we may have to increase our allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs
of accounts receivable
 and our results of operations would be harmed. An economic turndown could also decrease demand for our
products due to pricing concerns. The economic conditions in the U.S. and the countries in which we do business also affect foreign
exchange rates. We cannot predict the timing
 strength
 or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery
 whether global
 regional
or within specific markets. If the conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen
 our business could
be harmed. In addition
 even if the overall economy remains relatively strong
 the market for our products and services may not
experience growth.

If
we fail to enhance our brand
 our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our financial condition may suffer.

We
believe that the development of our trade names and various brands are critical to achieving widespread awareness of our products
and is important to attracting new customers and maintaining existing customers. We also believe that the importance of brand
recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the
effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable products at competitive prices. Brand promotion
activities may not yield increased revenue
 and even if they do
 any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred
in building our brand. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand
 our business could be adversely impacted.

Our
China business accounts for a significant part of our revenue and anticipated growth. Any decline in sales in China would harm
our business results
 as would any adverse regulatory action. Repatriation of profits from China may not be ensured.

Our
operations in China are conducted by Morinda&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary
 Tahitian Noni Beverages (China) Company Limited
(&ldquo;TNI China&rdquo;). TNI China received a direct selling license from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce in 2015. Our China
sales have been growing at a double-digit rate for the past several years
 making China our second largest market. If we cannot
continue to grow sales through our TNI China business
 it will have an adverse impact on our global results.

China
is a large and vibrant market but doing business in China requires navigation of a difficult regulatory environment. China has
published regulations governing direct selling&mdash;and several administrative methods and proclamations have been issued. These
regulations require TNI China to use a business model different from the one we offer in other markets. For TNI China to operate
under these regulations
 we have created and implemented a model specifically for China. However
 it is possible that interpretations
of direct selling laws could adversely affect our business in China or lead to fines against us or our IPCs.

It
can take one to three years to obtain product registrations in China. The lengthy process for obtaining product registrations
often prevents us from launching new product initiatives in China on the same timelines as other markets around the world.

Chinese
regulations prevent persons who are not Chinese nationals from selling in China. Our IPCs that do not have a China presence or
IPCs or wholesalers in China may have engaged or may engage in activities that violate our policies in this market
 or that violate
Chinese law or other applicable law
 and therefore result in regulatory action and adverse publicity.

Our
operations in China are subject to risks and uncertainties related to general economic and political conditions
 epidemics such
as coronavirus discussed above
 and legal developments in China. For example

of negative media coverage about the healthcare-related product claims made by a competitor in the direct selling industry in
China
 in 2019 the government increased its scrutiny of activities within the healthcare market

Chinese government exercises significant control over the Chinese economy
 including but not limited to controlling capital investments
allocating resources
 setting monetary policy
 controlling foreign exchange
 and monitoring foreign exchange rates
 implementing
and overseeing tax regulations
 providing preferential treatment to certain industry segments or companies
 and issuing necessary
licenses to conduct business. Accordingly
 any adverse change in the Chinese economy
 the Chinese legal system
 or Chinese governmental
economic
 or other policies could have a material adverse effect on our business in China and our prospects generally.

Over
the past several years
 the Company has received periodic license fees and annual dividends from TNI China. However
 there is
no guarantee this will continue
 and any change in government policy affecting payment of license fees or repatriation of profits
could harm the results and financial performance of the Company and reduce our access to cash resources.


    
    


Limits
on the sales compensation we can pay to our IPCs in certain countries could harm our business and cause regulatory risks.

Certain
markets
 including China
 Korea
 Indonesia
 and Vietnam
 impose limits on the sales compensation we can pay our IPCs. For example
in Korea
 local regulations limit sales compensation to 35% of our total revenue in Korea. These regulations may inhibit persons
from becoming IPCs or cause interested persons to join competitors not focused on compliance. We have had to modify our compensation
plan in certain markets to comply. It is difficult to keep compensation within limits and we may
 therefore
 be at risk of violating
limits even as we are trying to act under the regulations. It is not always clear which revenues and expenses are within the scope
of regulations. Any failure to keep sales compensation within legal limits in the above and other markets could result in fines
or other sanctions
 including suspensions.

It
is difficult and costly to protect and enforce our proprietary rights.

Our
commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining trademark protection
 patent protection
 and trade secret
protection of our products and brands
 and successfully defending that intellectual property against third-party challenges. We
can only protect our intellectual property if we have obtained rights under valid and enforceable trademarks
 patents
 or trade
secrets that cover our products and brands. Changes in either the trademark and patent laws or in interpretations of trademark
and patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We cannot predict the breadth
of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our issued trademarks or our issued patents. Future protection for our proprietary
rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us
to gain or keep our competitive advantage.

We
may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend
 and could result in our
loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.

From
time to time we may face intellectual property infringement
 misappropriation
 or invalidity/non-infringement claims from third
parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed
 and an adverse
outcome could affect us negatively. For example
 if a third party prevailed in an infringement claim against us
 we may have to
pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement was willful). In addition
 we could face an injunction
barring us from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require us to enter into a license
agreement which may not be under acceptable
 commercially reasonable
 or practical terms or we may be precluded from obtaining
a license. It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement against us may require us to dedicate substantial resources
and time in developing non-infringing alternatives
 which may or may not be possible. With diagnostic tests
 we would also need
to include non-infringing technologies which would require us to re-validate our tests. Any such re-validation
 besides being
costly and time consuming
 may be unsuccessful.

Finally
we may initiate claims to assert or defend our own intellectual property against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation
irrespective of whether we are the plaintiff or the defendant
 and regardless of the outcome
 is expensive and time-consuming
and could divert our management&rsquo;s attention from our business and negatively affect our operating results or financial condition.

Risks
Related to our Common Stock and Corporate Governance

The
price of our Common Stock may be volatile and adversely affected by many factors.

The
market price of our Common Stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events
 including without limitation:



    
    
our
    ability to integrate operations
 products
 and services


    
    
our
    ability to execute our business plan


    
    
operating
    results below expectations


    
    
litigation
    regarding product contamination


    
    
our
    issuance of additional securities
 including debt or equity or a combination thereof
 which may be necessary to fund our operating
    expenses


    
    
announcements
    of new or similar products by us or our competitors


    
    
loss
    of any strategic relationship
 including raw material provider or distributor relationships


    
    
period-to-period
    fluctuations in our financial results


    
    
changes
    in foreign exchange rates


    
    
developments
    concerning intellectual property rights


    
    
changes
    in legal
 regulatory
 and enforcement frameworks affecting our products




    
    




    
    
material
    weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting


    
    
the
    addition or departure of key personnel


    
    
announcements
    by us or our competitors of acquisitions
 investments
 or strategic alliances


    
    
actual
    or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in our industry


    
    
the
    level and changes in our year-over-year revenue growth rate


    
    
the
    failure of securities analysts to publish research about us
 or shortfalls in our results of operations compared to levels
    forecast by securities analysts


    
    
any
    delisting of our Common Stock from Nasdaq due to any failure to meet listing requirements


    
    
economic
    and other external factors
 and

    
    
the
    general state of the securities market.


These
market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Common Stock
 regardless of our operating performance.
Securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the performance of
particular companies.

You
may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.

In
order to raise additional capital
 we may in the future offer additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable for our Common Stock. For example
 we issued approximately 6.0 million and 34.7 million shares of our Common
Stock in public offerings for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. You may be unable to sell shares or other
securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the most recently publicly-traded price
or the price per share paid by existing investors
 and investors purchasing our shares or other securities in the future could
have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our Common Stock or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price
per share at this time.

Reports
published by analysts
 including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results
 could hurt the price and trading
volume of our common shares.

Securities
research analysts may establish and publish their own periodic projections for us. These projections may vary widely and may not
accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections
of these securities research analysts. Similarly
 if one or more analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes
inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business
 our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases
coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly
 our share price or trading volume could decline. If no analysts commence
coverage of us
 the market price and volume for our common shares could be hurt.

We
have not and may never pay dividends to shareholders.

We
have not declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. Our loan agreement with East West Bank prohibits
us from paying dividends. We intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion
 and therefore
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.

The
declaration
 payment
 and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors
 and will depend
upon
 among other things
 the results of our operations
 cash flows and financial condition
 operating and capital requirements
and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. Dividends may never be paid
 and
 if dividends are paid
 the amount
of any such dividend is unknown. If we do not pay dividends
 our Common Stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor&rsquo;s
investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.

Our
failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could cause a delisting of our Common Stock.

If
we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq
 such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum
closing bid price requirement
 Nasdaq may delist our Common Stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the
price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. If our Common
Stock is delisted
 our Common Stock may not become listed again.

Item
2. Properties.

We
believe our current physical properties are sufficient and adequate to meet our current and projected requirements. Presented
below is a discussion about our key properties by operating segment.

NewAge
Segment

In
January 2019
 we entered into a lease for our corporate headquarters consisting of approximately 11
200 square feet of office
space in the lower downtown area of Denver
 Street. Our monthly obligation for base rent averages
approximately $33
500 per month over the remaining lease term which expires in December 2029. In December 2019
 we agreed to sublease
approximately 3
300 square feet of this office space at base rent that averages approximately $8
200 over the term of the sublease
that expires in December 2022.

In
April 2019
 we entered into a lease for a new facility in Aurora
 Colorado where we conduct operations
 packaging
 distributions
and administrative activities for our NewAge segment. This building consists of approximately 156
000 square feet and provides
for average monthly rent of approximately $68
000 over the remaining lease term which expires in April 2029.

We
are currently attempting to sublease our former corporate headquarters and distribution facility located at 1700 E. 68th Avenue
in Denver
 Colorado. The monthly rent for this building averages approximately $58
500 over the remaining lease term that expires
in March 2027.

Noni
by NewAge Segment

The
Noni by NewAge segment&rsquo;s headquarters is in American Fork
 Utah
 in a 140
000 square foot office
 manufacturing
 warehouse
and shipping facility custom built on a 12-acre parcel for our exclusive use. Our monthly obligation for base rent averages approximately
$92
500 per month over the remaining lease term which expires in April 2026.

In
March 2019
 we entered into an agreement with a major Japanese real estate company resulting in the sale for approximately $57.1
million of the land and building in Tokyo that serves as the corporate headquarters of Morinda&rsquo;s Japanese subsidiary. Concurrently
with the sale
 we entered into a lease of this property for a term of 27 years with the option to terminate any time after seven
years. The monthly lease cost is &yen;20.0 million (approximately $183
000 based on the exchange rate as of December 31
2019) for the initial seven-year period of the lease term. After the seventh year of the lease term
 either party may elect to
adjust the monthly lease payment to the then current market rate for similar buildings in Tokyo. In order to secure our obligations
under the lease
 we provided a refundable security deposit of approximately $1.8 million. At any time after the seventh year of
the lease term
 we may elect to terminate the lease. However
 anniversary
of the lease inception date
 then we will be obligated to perform certain restoration obligations
 which we considered to be a
significant penalty whereby there is reasonable certainty that we will not elect to terminate the lease prior to the 20-year anniversary.

We
have a manufacturing
 office and warehouse facility in Chongqing
 China
 consisting of three buildings totaling approximately
64
500 square feet which are located on about three acres of land leased from the government through July 2060. Additional store
and office facilities are leased in many cities in China
 including Shanghai
 Beijing
 Taiyuan
 Fuzhou
 Hangzhou
 Guangzhou
 Weihai
Nanjing
 and Shenyang. We have a warehouse and noni-processing facility in Mataiea
 Tahiti
 consisting of approximately 82
250
square feet in a building located on about 13.5 acres of land leased from the government through May 2030. We also lease office
space in 37 additional locations in Europe
 Asia and North and South America.

Item
3. Legal Proceedings.

From
time to time
 we may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the
results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty
 we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary
course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome
 litigation can have an adverse
impact on us because of defense and settlement costs
 diversion of management resources
 and other factors. We are not aware of
any material proceedings in which the Company
 or any of our directors
 officers
 or affiliates
 or any registered or beneficial
stockholder is a party adverse to us
 or has a material interest adverse to us.

5. Market for Registrant&rsquo;s Common Equity
 Related Stockholder Matters
 and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our
Common Stock began trading on Nasdaq on February 17
 2017
 under the symbol &ldquo;NBEV.&rdquo; On March 10
 2020
 there were
approximately 690 stockholders of record of our Common Stock. We believe the number of beneficial owners of our Common Stock are
substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our outstanding Common Stock is held of record
in broker &ldquo;street names&rdquo; for the benefit of individual investors.



We
have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock to date and we are currently prohibited from paying dividends under our loan
agreement with East West Bank. The payment of any future cash dividends will be dependent upon our revenue
 earnings and financial
condition from time to time. The payment of any dividends will be within the discretion of our board of directors. It is presently
expected that we will retain all earnings for use in our business operations and
 accordingly
 it is not expected that our board
of directors will declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Operating
Segments

For
the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2019
 our operating segments have consisted of the Morinda segment and the NewAge segment.
We recently announced that Morinda has begun doing business as Noni by NewAge. As a result of this change
 we refer to our former
Morinda segment as the Noni by NewAge segment of our business.


    
    


The
Noni by NewAge segment is engaged in the development
 manufacturing
 and marketing of Tahitian Noni&reg; Juice

to the EWB Credit Facility in March 2020 as discussed in Note 16. These recent developments are also discussed below under the
caption 

In
December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China. In January
2020
 this coronavirus spread to other countries
 including the United States and Europe. The outbreak has continued to spread
and is currently classified as a pandemic. Efforts to contain the spread of this coronavirus has intensified. To date
 COVID-19
has not had a significant impact on our business. Although we currently expect that the disruptive impact of coronavirus on our
business will be temporary
 this situation continues to evolve and therefore we cannot predict the extent to which the coronavirus
will directly or indirectly affect our business and operating results. The impact could be material.

Key
Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations

Net
 We recognize revenue when we satisfy our performance obligations and we transfer control of the promised products
to our customers
 which generally occurs over a very short period of time. Performance obligations are typically satisfied by
shipping or delivering products to customers
 which is also the point when title transfers to customers. Revenue consists of the
gross sales price
 net of estimated returns and allowances
 discounts
 and personal rebates that are accounted for as a reduction
from the gross sale price. Shipping and handling charges that are billed to customers are included as a component of revenue.

Cost
 Cost of goods sold primarily consists of direct costs attributable to the purchase from third party suppliers
or the internal manufacture of beverage products. It also includes freight costs
 shrinkage
 ecommerce fulfillment
 distribution
and warehousing costs related to products sold.

Commissions.
Commissions earned by our sales and marketing personnel are charged to expense in the same period that the related sales
transactions are recognized.

Selling
 Selling
 general and administrative (&ldquo;SG&amp;A&rdquo;) expenses consist primarily
of personnel costs for our administrative
 human resources
 finance and accounting employees and executives. General and administrative
expenses also include contract labor and consulting costs
related expenses
 legal
 auditing and other professional
fees
 rent and facilities costs
 repairs and maintenance
 advertising and marketing costs
 and general corporate expenses.

Business
 When we enter into business combinations
 the acquisition-related transaction costs are accounted
for as expenses in the periods in which such costs are incurred. A portion of the consideration in business combinations may be
contingent on future operating performance of the acquired business. In these circumstances
 we determine the fair value of the
contingent consideration as a component of the purchase price
 and all future changes in the fair value of our obligations are
reflected as an adjustment to our operating expenses in the period in which the change is determined. In periods when the fair
value of contingent consideration increases
 we recognize an expense and when the fair value of contingent consideration decreases
we recognize a gain.


    
    


Impairment
 We periodically consider if events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate if it is &ldquo;more likely
than not&rdquo; that an impairment of our long-lived assets has occurred. We also perform an annual goodwill impairment evaluation
during the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Evaluating whether impairment exists involves substantial judgment and estimation.
If we determine that impairment exists
 we recognize an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived assets
to the expected discounted cash flows associated with the impaired assets.

Depreciation
 Depreciation and amortization expense is comprised of depreciation expense related to property
and equipment
 amortization expense related to leasehold improvements
 and amortization expense related to identifiable intangible
assets.

Gains
 Gains from the sale of property and equipment are reflected in the period that the
sale transaction closes. Gains result when we sell assets for an amount in excess of the net carrying value. Losses from the disposal
of property and equipment are netted against gains for presentation in our consolidated statements of operations.

Interest
 Interest expense is incurred under our revolving credit facilities and other debt obligations. The components
of interest expense include the amount of interest payable in cash at the stated interest rate
 &ldquo;make-whole&rdquo; premium
accretion and amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs
 and the write-off of debt discounts and issuance costs if we
prepay the debt before the maturity date.

Gain
 We periodically enter into certain debt instruments that contain embedded
derivatives that are required to be bifurcated and recorded at fair value. Examples of embedded derivatives are provisions that
require us to pay the lender default interest upon the existence of an event of default and to pay &ldquo;make-whole&rdquo; interest
or premiums for certain mandatory and voluntary prepayments of the outstanding principal balance. We also enter into interest
rate swap agreements to effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. We perform valuations of all material derivatives
on a quarterly basis. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected as net non-operating gains or losses in our consolidated
statements of operations.

Interest
and other income (expense)
 Interest and other income (expense)
 net consists of non-operating expenses which are
partially offset by interest and other non-operating income.

Income
 The provision for income taxes is based on the amount of our taxable income and enacted federal
 state and
foreign tax rates
 as adjusted for allowable credits and deductions. Substantially all of our provision for current income taxes
consists of foreign taxes for the periods presented since we had no taxable income for U.S. federal or state purposes.

Comparison
of Years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018

Inflation
For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the impact of inflation and changing prices have
not had a significant impact on our net revenue
 cost of goods sold and operating expenses.

Net
Net revenue increased from $52.2 million for the year ended December 31
 2018 to $253.7 million for the year
ended December 31
 2019
 an increase of $201.5 million or 386%. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 this increase was primarily
attributable to the Noni by NewAge
 which had an increase in net revenue of $196.9 million. This was because the Morinda business
combination did not close until December 21
 2018
 whereby only $3.8 million of net revenue was generated by the Noni by NewAge
segment for the year ended December 31
 2018 compared to $200.7 million for the year ended December 31
 2019.

Net
revenue for the NewAge segment increased by $4.7 million from $48.3 million for the year ended December 31
 2018 to $53.0 million
for the year ended December 31
 2019. The increase in net revenue for the NewAge segment was attributable to the acquisition of
BWR
 which had net revenue of $4.9 million for the period from the closing date on July 10
 2019 through December 31
 2019
 partially
offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in net revenue attributable to the legacy products of the NewAge segment.


    
    


Cost
 Cost of goods sold increased from $42.9 million for the year ended December 31
 2018 to $101.0 million
for the year ended December 31
 2019
 an increase of $58.1 million. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 $44.1 million of this
increase was attributable to the Noni by NewAge segment. The Morinda business combination did not close until December 21
 2018
whereby only $0.9 million of cost of goods sold was incurred by the Noni by NewAge segment for the year ended December 31
 2018
as compared to $56.0 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. The remainder of the increase in cost of goods sold of $13.1
million was attributable to the NewAge segment
 which increased from $42.0 million for the year ended December 31
 2018 to $56.0
million for the year ended December 31
 2019
%. This
increase in cost of goods sold for the NewAge segment was due to (i) the acquisition of BWR
 which had cost of goods sold of $4.9
million for the period from the closing date on July 10
 2019 through December 31
 2019
 and (ii) approximately $8.2 million attributable
to the legacy products of NewAge due to higher product costs incurred in the second half of 2018 due to smaller production runs
and buying raw materials in smaller amounts on the spot market
 which was related to our working capital constraints in 2018.
In fiscal 2019
 the Company incurred significant discounting of branded products from national distributors which decreased our
margins on these products. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we continued to cycle through these higher cost inventories
which increased our cost of goods sold. Additionally
 during the year ended December 31
 2019
 we completed full inventory counts
and reconciliations which resulted in an expense of $1.6 million.

Gross
 Gross profit increased from $9.3 million for the year ended December 31
 2018 to $152.7 million for the year ended
December 31
 2019
 an increase of $143.4 million. Gross margin increased from 18% for the year ended December 31
 2018 to 60%
for the year ended December 31
 2019. The increase in gross profit and gross margin was attributable to the business combination
with Morinda on December 21
 2018. Gross profit for the Noni by NewAge segment increased by $152.8 million and resulted in a gross
margin of 78%.

Gross
profit for the NewAge segment decreased by $9.4 million
 resulting in negative gross profit of $3.0 million for the year ended
December 31
 2019. Gross profit for the BWR reporting unit acquired in July 2019 was breakeven with net revenue and cost of goods
sold of $4.9 million. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 the overall reduction of $9.4 million in gross profit for the legacy
%
compared to net revenue that decreased by 1%. The poor performance by the NewAge segment was a key factor that resulted in
significant charges for impairment of long-lived assets discussed below. Based on the fiscal 2019 results of the BWR and legacy
brands businesses
 the Company is reviewing its strategic alternatives for these products.

Commissions.
Commissions increased from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31
 2018 to $76.0 million for the year ended December
31
 2019
 an increase of $73.2 million. The Morinda business combination accounted for $72.9 million of the increase in commissions.
The remainder of the increase in commissions of $0.3 million was primarily attributable to the NewAge segment
 including $0.1
million attributable to the BWR reporting unit. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 commissions for the Noni by NewAge segment
amounted to approximately 37% of the related net revenue whereas commissions for the NewAge segment were approximately 3% of the
related net revenue of the NewAge segment.

Selling
 SG&amp;A expenses increased from $20.3 million for the year ended December 31
 2018
to $115.0 million for the year ended December 31
 2019
 an increase of $94.7 million. This increase consisted of $83.1 million
related to the Noni by NewAge segment and $11.6 million related to the NewAge segment. The key components of the $83.1 million
of SG&amp;A expenses for the Noni by NewAge segment consist of (i) compensation and benefit costs of $44.5 million
 including
stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million
 (ii) business meetings
 awards
 promotions and travel of $17.0 million
 (iii)
rent
 repairs and other occupancy costs of $10.0 million
 (iv) professional fees of $4.1 million
 and (v) transaction fees
 communications
expense and other of $7.5 million.

The
increase in SG&amp;A for the NewAge segment was partially driven by the business combination with BWR that accounted for $2.9
million of SG&amp;A for the period from July 10
 2019 through December 31
 2019. The remainder of the increase in SG&amp;A for
the NewAge segment of $8.7 million consisted of (i) compensation and benefits of $3.2 million
 including an increase in stock-based
compensation of $0.7 million
 (ii) rent and occupancy costs of $3.0 million
 (iii) director and officer insurance premiums and
other costs of $1.2 million
 and (iv) professional fees of $1.3 million.

Change
 For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we recognized a gain of $13.8 million from
changes in the fair value of earnout obligations. A gain of $12.9 million was attributable to the Morinda business combination
and a gain of $0.9 million was attributable to the Marley business combination
 for a total of $13.8 million.

In
connection with the Morinda business combination
 we issued Series D Preferred Stock that provides for an annual dividend of $0.2
million and a milestone dividend of up to an aggregate of $15.0 million if the Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda is at least $20.0 million
for the year ended December 31
 2019. As of December 31
 2019 and December 31
 2018
 the estimated fair value of the Series D
Preferred Stock was approximately $0.2 million and $13.1 million
 respectively. The reduction in fair value was due to our assessment
that the Adjusted EBITDA target would not be achieved and that the only value associated with the Series D Preferred Stock is
approximately $0.2 million for the annual dividend. Accordingly
 we recognized an unrealized gain of approximately $12.9 million
for the year ended December 31
 2019.


    
    


We
are also subject to an earnout obligation in connection with the Marley business combination that provides for a one-time payment
of $1.25 million beginning at such time that revenue for the Marley reporting unit is equal to or greater than $15.0 million during
any trailing 12 calendar month period. As of December 31
 2018
 the estimated fair value of the Marley earnout was approximately
$0.9 million. Due to deteriorating net revenue and gross profit for the Marley reporting unit
 we determined that it is unlikely
that the Marley earnout will ever be achieved. Accordingly
 there was no fair value associated with the Marley earnout obligation
as of December 31
 2019
 which resulted in a gain of $0.9 million. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 the fair value of the
Marley earnout increased by $0.1 million
 which was reported as a business combination expense for the year ended December 31
2018.

Impairment
 For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we recognized an aggregate charge of $47.2 million for the impairment of
long-lived assets. During the fourth quarter of 2019
 we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing. Our qualitative assessment
indicated that impairment may exist for each reporting unit within the NewAge segment. Therefore
 as of December 31
 2019 we also
performed a quantitative assessment of the fair value of each of our reporting units within the NewAge and Noni by NewAge segments.
The primary basis for our quantitative assessment was a valuation report for all of our reporting units that was performed by
an independent specialist. The result of this valuation resulted in an aggregate impairment charge of $44.9 million to eliminate
the net carrying value of all goodwill and substantially all identifiable intangible assets related to all of the reporting units
of the NewAge segment.

In
June 2019
 we began attempting to sublease a portion of our right-of-use (&ldquo;ROU&rdquo;) assets previously used for warehouse
space that were no longer needed for current operations. As a result
 an impairment evaluation was completed that resulted in
recognition of an impairment charge of $1.5 million in June 2019. This evaluation was based on the expected time to obtain a suitable
subtenant and current market rates for similar commercial properties. As of December 31
 2019
 we were continuing our efforts
to obtain a subtenant for this space. Accordingly
 an updated impairment evaluation was performed which resulted in an additional
impairment charge of $0.8 million for total impairment of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. It is possible that
further impairment charges will be incurred if we are not able to locate a subtenant in the next six to eight months
 or if the
sublease terms are less favorable than our current expectations.

Depreciation
 Depreciation and amortization expense included in operating expenses increased from $2.3 million
for the year ended December 31
 2018 to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31
 2019
 an increase of $6.1 million. Approximately
$6.3 million of this increase was due to assets acquired in the Morinda business combination
 which accounted for approximately
$2.9 million of depreciation related to property and equipment and $3.4 million of amortization related to identifiable intangible
assets. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in the BWR business combination also accounted for an increase in amortization
expense of $0.1 million. These increases totaled $6.4 million and were partially offset by a reduction in amortization expense
of $0.3 million due to the impairment charges that eliminated the net carrying value of substantially all of the intangible assets
of the NewAge segment.

Gain
 On March 22
 2019
 we entered into an agreement with a major Japanese real estate company resulting
in the sale for approximately $57.0 million of the land and building in Tokyo that serves as the corporate headquarters of Morinda&rsquo;s
Japanese subsidiary. Concurrently with the sale
 we entered into a lease of this property for an expected term of 20 years with
an extension option for an additional seven years. The sale of this property resulted in a gain of $24.1 million. We determined
that $17.6 million of the gain was the result of above-market rent inherent in the leaseback arrangement. The $17.6 million portion
of the gain related to above-market rent is being accounted for as a lease financing obligation whereby the gain will result in
a reduction of rent expense of approximately $0.9 million per year over the 20-year lease term. The remainder of the gain of $6.4
million was attributable to the highly competitive process among the entities that bid to purchase the property and
 accordingly
is recognized as a gain in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31
 2019. For the year ended December
31
 2018
 no gain or loss was recognized since we did not sell any of our property and equipment.

Gain
 For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we recognized a net gain from the change
in fair value of derivatives of $0.4 million compared to a loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31
 2018. In July
2019
 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with EWB. This swap agreement provides for a total notional amount of $10.0
million at a fixed interest rate of approximately 5.4% through May 1
 2023
 in exchange for a floating rate indexed to the prime
rate plus 0.5%. Through December 31
 2019
 we had an unrealized loss from this interest rate swap agreement of approximately $0.1
million. This unrealized loss was offset by a gain of $0.5 million from the change in fair value of embedded derivatives related
to the Siena Revolver that was terminated in March 2019. As a result of these two derivatives
 we recognized a net gain from change
in fair value of derivatives of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 we had
a loss from the change in fair value of embedded derivatives of $0.5 million related to our former Siena Revolver credit facility.


    
    


Interest
 Interest expense increased from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31
 2018 to $3.7 million for the year
ended December 31
 2019
 an increase of $2.6 million. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 interest expense was primarily attributable
to (i) termination of the Siena Revolver
 which resulted in a make-whole prepayment penalty of $0.5 million
 (ii) accretion of
discount and write-off of debt issuance costs of $0.5 million related to the Siena Revolver
 (iii) accretion of discount and amortization
of debt discount for a total of $1.2 million related to the Morinda business combination liabilities and the EWB Credit Facility
(iv) imputed interest expense of $0.5 million related to a deferred lease financing obligation
 and (v) interest expense based
on the contractual rates and swap settlements under the EWB Credit Facility of $0.7 million based on a weighted average interest
rate of 5.6% and weighted average borrowings outstanding of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31
 2019.

For
the year ended December 31
 2018
 we incurred interest expense of $1.1 million which was primarily related to a senior
secured convertible promissory note with a principal balance of $4.75 million that was borrowed in June 2018. Due to the
early extinguishment of this note in August 2018
 we recognized accretion for all of the debt discount and issuance costs of
$0.6 million
 interest expense at the stated rate for $0.1 million
 and a make-whole prepayment fee of $0.2 million. In
addition
 for the year ended December 31
 2018
 we incurred interest expense for an aggregate of $0.2 million under
a revolving credit agreement with U.S. Bank
 the Siena Revolver and the Maverick Series B note payable.

Other
expense
 For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 we had other expense
 net of $0.3 million and $0.2 million
respectively. Other expense
 net for the year ended December 31
 2019 consisted of other non-operating expense of $0.5 million
partially offset by interest income of $0.2 million. Other expense
 net for the year ended December 31
 2018 consisted of miscellaneous
non-operating expense of $0.2 million.

Income
 For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we recognized income tax expense of $12.7 million
 which consisted
of foreign income taxes of $17.6 million
 partially offset by a net deferred income tax benefit of $4.9 million. Foreign income
taxes consisted of approximately $11.9 million that was incurred in March 2019 due to our sale leaseback of the building that
serves as Morinda&rsquo;s Japanese headquarters
 and the remaining $5.7 million was primarily attributable to profitable operations
in foreign jurisdictions.

For
the year ended December 31
 2018
 we recognized an income tax benefit of $8.9 million as a result of deferred income tax liabilities
recorded in connection with the Morinda business combination. We determined that our net operating loss carryforwards will offset
any income tax expense related to the deferred income tax liabilities for Morinda. Accordingly
 we recognized an $8.9 million
deferred income tax benefit for the year ended December 31
 2018.


    
    


Liquidity
and Capital Resources



As
of December 31
 2019
 we had cash and cash equivalents of $60.8 million and working capital of $33.5 million. For the year ended
December 31
 2019
 we incurred a net loss of $89.8 million and we used cash in our operating activities of $31.8 million.

As
of December 31
 2019
 we have contractual obligations of approximately $21.6 million that are due during the year ending December
31
 2020
 including (i) payables to the former stockholders of Morinda of $5.7 million as discussed below
 (ii) operating lease
payments of $8.4 million
 (iii) up to $2.8 million for principal and estimated interest payments due under our EWB Credit Facility
(as defined below)
 (iv) open purchase orders for inventories of $3.4 million
 and (v) payments under employment agreements of
$1.3 million. Our contractual obligations discussed above exclude discretionary principal payments under the EWB Revolver for
$9.7 million that were paid on January 2
 2020 and which can be reborrowed subject to the terms of the EWB Credit Facility.

As
discussed below
 we entered into the third amendment and waiver (the &ldquo;Third Amendment&rdquo;) to the EWB Credit Facility
on March 13
 2020. The Third Amendment is expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources for the
year ending December 31
 2020
 because we are required to maintain an aggregate of $15.1 million in restricted cash balances with
EWB. Accordingly
 this portion of our cash resources will be available for future principal payments under the EWB Term Loan but
may not be used for any other purposes. The Third Amendment also requires us to raise equity infusions of $15.0 million
for the first six months of 2020 (of which $6.3 million was received in January 2020)
 and to raise cumulative equity infusions
of $30.0 million for the year ending December 31
 2020. We intend to raise the required cumulative equity infusions of
$30.0 million through the ATM Offering Agreement (described below). The ATM Offering Agreement is scheduled to terminate on April
30
 2020
 but we intend to seek an extension. We may also meet the requirement for equity infusions through other types of equity
offerings. We believe we will be able to raise the remaining $23.7 million of the equity infusions by December 31
 2020.
However
 there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising such funds at terms acceptable to us or at all.

We
believe our existing cash resources of $60.8 million
 combined with our ability to raise equity funding through the ATM Offering
Agreement or through other equity offerings
 will be sufficient to fund the restricted cash required by EWB of $15.1 million
our contractual obligations of $21.6 million
 and working capital requirements for the next 12 months.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 a sale leaseback of Morinda&rsquo;s Japanese headquarters
 public offerings under the ATM Offering
Agreement
 the refinancing of our bank debt
 and payments related to the Morinda business combination had a significant impact
on our liquidity and capital resources. These transactions are discussed further below.

Sale
Leaseback

On
March 22
 2019
 we entered into an agreement with a major Japanese real estate company resulting in the sale for approximately
$57.1 million of the land and building in Tokyo that serves as the corporate headquarters of Morinda&rsquo;s Japanese subsidiary.
Concurrently with the sale
 we entered into a lease of this property for a term of 27 years with the option to terminate at any
time after seven years. The monthly lease cost is &yen;20.0 million (approximately $183
000 based on the exchange rate
as of December 31
 2019) for the initial seven-year term
 and thereafter either party may elect to adjust the monthly lease payment
to the then current market rate for similar buildings in Tokyo. In order to secure our obligations under the lease
 we provided
 anniversary
of the lease inception date
 then we will be obligated to perform certain restoration obligations. We determined that the restoration
obligations are a significant penalty whereby there is reasonable certainty that we will not elect to terminate the lease prior
to the 20-year anniversary. Therefore
 we determined the lease term was 20 years for financial reporting purposes.

In
connection with this transaction
 the following payments were or will be made: (i) $25.0 million to the former stockholders of
Morinda to settle the contingent financing liability that we paid in June 2019
 (ii) $2.6 million to terminate the mortgage on
the building which was paid directly to the mortgage holder to eliminate the lien on the property
 (iii) transaction costs of
$1.9 million
 (iv) post-closing repair obligations of $1.7 million
 and (v) Japanese income taxes of $11.9 million that were paid
in February 2020. After all of these payments are made
 the net increase in our liquidity and capital resources from the sale
leaseback was approximately $12.6 million.


    
    


At
the Market Offering Agreement

On
April 30
 2019
 we entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement (the &ldquo;ATM Offering Agreement&rdquo;) with Roth Capital
Partners
 LLC (the &ldquo;Agent&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $100
million in shares of our Common Stock (the &ldquo;Placement Shares&rdquo;)
 through the Agent. We have no obligation to sell any
of the Placement Shares under the ATM Offering Agreement
 which terminates on April 30
 2020 and may be earlier terminated by
both parties. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes
 including working capital. Under
the terms of the ATM Offering Agreement
 we agreed to pay the Agent a commission equal to 3% of the gross proceeds from the gross
sales price of the Placement Shares up to $30 million
 and 2.5% of the gross proceeds from the gross sales price of the Placement
Shares in excess of $30 million. Through December 31
 2019
 we sold an aggregate of approximately 6.0 million shares of Common
Stock for gross proceeds of approximately $20.7 million. Total commissions and other offering costs deducted from the proceeds
were $1.2 million for net proceeds of $19.5 million. In January 2020
 we received additional net proceeds under the ATM Offering
Agreement of $6.3 million from the issuance of approximately 3.5 million shares of our Common Stock.

East
West Bank Credit Facility

On
March 29
 2019
 we entered into a credit facility with East West Bank (the &ldquo;EWB Credit Facility&rdquo;). The EWB Credit
Facility matures on March 29
 2023 (the &ldquo;Maturity Date&rdquo;) and provides for (i) a term loan in the aggregate principal
amount of $15.0 million
 which may be increased to $25.0 million subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (the &ldquo;EWB
Term Loan&rdquo;) and (ii) a $10.0 million revolving loan agreement (the &ldquo;EWB Revolver&rdquo;). As of December 31
 2019
we had outstanding borrowings of $14.8 million under the EWB Term Loan and $9.7 million under the EWB Revolver. On January 2
2020
 we elected to make a voluntary prepayment of $9.7 million to repay all outstanding borrowings under the EWB Revolver.

Our
.
The EWB Credit Facility requires compliance with certain financial and restrictive covenants and includes customary events of
default. Key financial covenants include maintenance of minimum Adjusted EBITDA and a maximum Total Leverage Ratio (all as defined
and set forth in the EWB Credit Facility). During any periods when an event of default occurs
 the EWB Credit Facility provides
for interest at a rate that is 3.0% above the rate otherwise applicable to such obligations. As of December 31
 2019
 we were
not in compliance with our minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant. Our non-compliance with this covenant was waived in connection with
the Third Amendment to the EWB Credit Facility. There is no assurance EWB will waive any future instances of noncompliance.

Borrowings
outstanding under the EWB Credit Facility bear interest at the Prime Rate (4.25% as of December 31
 2019) plus 0.5%. However
if the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the EWB Credit Facility) is subsequently less than 1.50 to 1.00
 borrowings will bear
interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.25%. We may voluntarily prepay amounts outstanding under the EWB Revolver without prepayment
charges on ten business days&rsquo; prior notice to EWB. In the event the EWB Revolver is terminated prior to the Maturity Date
we would be required to pay an early termination fee in the amount of 0.50% of the revolving line. Additional borrowing requests
under the EWB Revolver are subject to various customary conditions precedent
 including satisfaction of a borrowing base test
as more fully described in the EWB Credit Facility. The EWB Revolver also provides for an unused line fee equal to 0.5% per annum
of the undrawn portion. The EWB Revolver includes a subjective acceleration clause and a lockbox arrangement where we are required
to direct our customers to remit payments to a restricted bank account
 whereby all available funds are used to pay down the outstanding
principal balance under the EWB Revolver. Accordingly
 we are required to classify the entire outstanding principal balance of
the EWB Revolver as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets.

Payments
under the EWB Term Loan were interest-only through September 2019 and are followed by monthly principal payments of $125
000 plus
interest until the Maturity Date of the EWB Term Loan. We may elect to prepay the EWB Term Loan before the Maturity Date on 10
business days&rsquo; notice to EWB subject to a prepayment fee of 2% for the first year of the EWB Term Loan and 1% for the second
year of the EWB Term Loan. No later than 120 days after the end of each fiscal year
 commencing with the fiscal year ending December
31
 2019
 we are required to make a payment towards the outstanding principal amount of the EWB Term Loan in an amount equal to
35% of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Facility)
 if the Total Leverage Ratio is less than 1.50 to 1.00 or 50%
of the Excess Cash Flow if the Total Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00. Mandatory principal payments based
on Excess Cash Flow generated in subsequent quarters are excluded from our current liabilities since they are contingent payments
based on the generation of working capital in the future. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we were not required to make any
principal payments related to Excess Cash Flow.

On
August 5
 2019
 we entered into a first amendment to the EWB Credit Facility effective as of July 11
 2019
 pursuant to which
EWB waived non-compliance by the Company with certain covenants in the EWB Credit Facility that may have occurred or would otherwise
arise as a result of the BWR Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the first amendment
 BWR entered into a Supplement to Guarantee and
Pledge and an Intellectual Property Security Agreement. On October 9
 2019
 we entered into a second amendment to the EWB Credit
Facility under which EWB waived (i) any default for failure to maintain at least $5.0 million of net cash with EWB in the United
States or in China during the period from July 25
 2019 to October 9
 2019 and (ii) any default for failing to maintain primary
operating accounts with EWB
 and ensuring that the Company&rsquo;s deposit and investment accounts with third party financial
institutions located in China contain no more than 40% of the Company&rsquo;s total cash
 cash equivalents and investment balances
maintained in China. The second amendment also amended the EWB Credit Facility to (i) extend the time period to establish compliance
with the operating account provisions until November 30
 2019
 (ii) to make the covenants no longer applicable to the Company&rsquo;s
subsidiaries in China
 and (iii) to decrease the amount of net cash from $5.0 million to $2.0 million that the Company is required
to maintain with EWB on and after December 31
 2019.


    
    



On
March 13
 2020
 we entered into the Third Amendment to the EWB Credit Facility whereby EWB waived our failure to comply with the
minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant for the 12-month period ended December 31
 2019. In addition
 the Third Amendment modified the
EWB Credit Facility as follows:



    
    
We
    are required to maintain an aggregate of $15.1 million in restricted cash accounts with EWB. In the future
 this amount will
    be reduced by the amount of future principal payments under the EWB Term Loan.

    
    
Less
    stringent requirements are applicable for future compliance with the minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant
 the maximum total leverage
    ratio
 and the fixed charge coverage ratio. Additionally
 compliance with the maximum total leverage ratio and the fixed charge
    coverage ratio have been delayed until June 30
 2021.

    
    
The
    existing provisions related to &ldquo;equity cures&rdquo; that may be employed to maintain compliance with financial covenants
    were increased from $5.0 million to $15.0 million for the year ending December 31
 2020
 and $10.0 million per year for each
    calendar year thereafter.

    
    
We
    are required to obtain equity infusions for at least $15.0 million for the first six months of 2020
 of which $6.3
    million was received in January 2020. In addition
 cumulative equity infusions of $30.0 million must be received for the year
    ending December 31
2020.

    
    
The
    interest rate applicable to our outstanding borrowings under the EWB Term Loan and the EWB Revolver increased to 2.0% in excess
    of the prime rate. If we subsequently comply for two consecutive fiscal quarters with both the maximum total leverage ratio
    and the fixed charge coverage ratio
 the interest rate will be reduced to 0.50% in excess of the prime rate (assuming that
    the Company&rsquo;s total leverage ratio is less than 1.50 to 1.00).


Business
Combination Liabilities

We
issued series D preferred stock in connection with the Morinda business combination. The series D preferred stock is classified
as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. By April 15
 2020
 we are obligated to pay an annual dividend of $0.2 million.
The series D preferred stock includes an earnout payment based on the calculation of a milestone dividend. The maximum milestone
dividend is $15.0 million if the adjusted EBITDA of Morinda is $20.0 million or more for the year ended December 31
 2019. If
adjusted EBITDA is $17.0 million or less for the year ending December 31
 2019
 no milestone dividend is payable. Morinda&rsquo;s
adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019 was less than $17.0 million and
 accordingly
 no milestone dividend is payable.

The
series D preferred stock is recorded in our financial statements at fair value
 which amounted to $0.2 million as of December
31
 2019. In addition
 we are obligated to make the final excess working capital (&ldquo;EWC&rdquo;) payment in July 2020. The
EWC obligation is $5.5 million and the net carrying value of this obligation was approximately $5.3 million as of December 31
2019.

In
connection with the Marley business combination in 2017
 we are obligated to make a one-time earnout payment of $1.25 million
over a period of two years beginning at such time that revenue for the Marley reporting unit is equal to or greater than $15.0
million during any trailing 12 calendar month period. Revenue for the Marley reporting unit is not currently expected to exceed
the $15.0 million earnout threshold
 which resulted in the elimination of the net carrying value of the liability in 2019.

liabilities as of December 31

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 our net loss was $89.8 million compared to a net loss of $12.1 million for the year ended December
31
 above for a discussion of the factors that resulted in our
net loss for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 non-cash expenses partially mitigated the impact of our net loss by $71.9 million. Non-cash
expenses consisted of (i) long-lived asset impairment expense of $47.2 million
 (ii) depreciation and amortization expense of
$8.8 million
 (iii) non-cash lease expense of $7.1 million
 (iv) stock-based compensation expense of $6.4 million
 (v)
accretion and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $1.9 million
 and (vi) make-whole premium of $0.5
million.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 we recognized non-cash gains due to changes in the fair value of the Morinda and Marley earnout
obligations of $13.8 million
 and derivatives of $0.4 million for a total of $14.2 million. For the year ended December 31
 2019
for financial reporting purposes we had a gain on sale of property and equipment of $6.4 million due to the sale of our land and
building in Tokyo. This $6.4 million gain is excluded from our operating cash flows because it was generated from the receipt
of investing cash flows. Differences in the timing of our recognition of the gain on sale for income tax and financial reporting
purposes are primarily responsible for the deferred income tax benefit of $4.9 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. All
of these non-cash gains and deferred tax benefits favorably impacted our net loss but did not generate any operating cash flows
for the year ended December 31
 2019.


    
    



For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $11.8 million of operating cash flows.
Changes that increased operating cash flows include (i) a net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $8.6 million
that was driven by the increase in current income taxes payable
 (ii) a reduction in inventories of $2.8 million
 and (iii) a
reduction in prepaid expenses
 deposits and other assets of $0.9 million. These increases in operating cash flows total $12.3
million and were partially offset by reduced cash flow due to an increase of $0.5 million in our trade receivables. As of December
31
 2019
 substantially all of our current income tax liabilities of $15.2 million either have been paid
 or are scheduled for
payment
 in the first quarter of 2020. Accordingly
 these payments will result in negative operating cash flows in the period
in which we are required to make the payments.

For
the year ended December 31
 2018
 our net loss of $12.1 million
 a deferred income tax benefit of $8.9 million and changes in
operating assets and liabilities of $8.7 million resulted in combined negative operating cash flow of $29.8 million. However
non-cash expenses of $7.4 million
 and non-cash losses related to the change in fair value of derivatives and earnout obligations
for an aggregate of $0.6 million
 partially mitigated this impact to arrive at net cash used in operating activities of $21.8
million. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 non-cash expenses of $7.4 million included depreciation and amortization expense
of $2.3 million
 stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million
 acquisition costs settled in shares of Common Stock for $1.2
million
 accretion and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $0.8 million
 non-cash lease expense of $0.4 million
and a cash expense for make-whole applicable premium of $0.2 million that was classified as a financing cash outflow since it
related to the prepayment of debt..

For
the year ended December 31
 2018
 we recognized non-cash expenses due to changes in the fair value of the Marley earnout obligations
of $0.1 million
 and derivatives of $0.5 million for a total of $0.6 million. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 the net changes
in operating assets and liabilities used $8.7 million of operating cash flows
 including (i) an increase in inventories of $3.4
million
 (ii) an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.7 million
 and (iii) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of $4.9 million. These uses of cash totaled $10.0 million and were partially offset by cash collections that resulted
in a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.3 million.

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 cash provided by investing activities of $29.4 million was primarily driven by the sale leaseback
of our land and building in Tokyo. The gross selling price was $57.1 million. After deducting commissions and other selling expenses
of $1.9 million
 the net proceeds amounted to $55.2 million. The net proceeds attributable to investing activities included $36.2
million that was attributable to the sale of the property
 and $1.3 million that was designated to fund future repair obligations
for a total of $37.5 million. The remainder of the net proceeds of $17.6 million was a financial inducement to enter into a 20-year
operating lease as discussed under 

Investing
cash outflows for the year ended December 31
 2019 included (i) capital expenditures for property and equipment of $5.4 million
(ii) a security deposit of $1.8 million withheld by the purchaser in the sale leaseback
 and (iii) cash paid for our business
combination with BWR for $1.0 million. Our capital expenditures included property and equipment for our Noni by NewAge segment
of $4.2 million
 and capital expenditures for our NewAge segment of $1.2 million. Capital expenditures for the Noni by NewAge
segment included leasehold improvements of $2.0 million to the Tokyo
 Japan headquarters facility
 manufacturing line improvements
of $0.4 million in our Rongchang
 China facility
 and leasehold improvement for a new leased facility in Shanghai
 China. Capital
expenditures for the NewAge segment included leasehold improvements related to our new distribution facility in Aurora
 Colorado
of $0.3 million
 transportation equipment of $0.2 million
 and furniture and office equipment primarily related to our new leased
facilities in Aurora and Denver
 Colorado for a total of $0.4 million.

For
the year ended December 31
 2018
 our principal use of cash in investing activities resulted from a cash payment of $75.0 million
to purchase the Noni by NewAge segment in December 2018. This cash payment was offset by the cash
 cash equivalents and restricted
cash of $46.3 million that we acquired from Morinda for a net cash outlay of $28.7 million. For the year ended December 31
 2018
we also made capital expenditures primarily for machinery and equipment for $0.7 million
 of which approximately $0.6 million
was paid in December 2018 related to the Noni by NewAge segment.

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities

Our
financing activities provided net cash proceeds of $19.4 million for the year ended December 31
 2019
 as compared to net cash
proceeds received of $96.4 million for the year ended December 31
 2018. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 the principal sources
of cash from our financing activities consisted of (i) $61.3 million of borrowings
 including $51.7 million under the EWB Credit
Facility and $9.6 million under the Siena Revolver that was terminated in March 2019
 (ii) net proceeds of $20.1 million from
the issuance of approximately 6.0 million shares of Common Stock pursuant to the ATM Offering Agreement
 (iii) proceeds of $17.6
million for the deferred lease financing obligation related to the sale leaseback of our land and building in Tokyo
 and (iv)
proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.6 million. These financing cash proceeds totaled $99.6 million and were partially
offset by (i) principal payments under debt agreements of $43.9 million
 including $29.2 million under the EWB Credit Facility
$9.7 million under the Siena Revolver
 $2.6 million to repay the mortgage on the sale of our land and building in Tokyo
 and $2.4
million to terminate the line of credit assumed in the business combination with BWR
 (ii) payment of Morinda business combination
liabilities of $34.0 million
 (iii) payments for debt issuance costs of $1.0 million to obtain the EWB Credit Facility
 (iv) payment
of make-whole premium of $0.5 million as a result of the termination of the Siena Revolver
 (v) cash payments of $0.5 million
for offering costs related to the ATM Offering Agreement
 and (vi) cash payments to reduce a deferred lease financing obligation
of $0.5 million as discussed below. The Siena Revolver was terminated on March 29
 2019 and was replaced by the EWB Credit Facility.


    
    



As
discussed above
 the net proceeds received from the buyer of our land and building in Tokyo included $17.6 million that represented
an inducement to enter into the related leaseback financing arrangement. Since we agreed to pay above market lease payments for
the 20-year lease term in exchange for an up-front cash payment included in the selling price
 we have recognized a deferred lease
financing obligation for this amount. For financial reporting purposes
 a portion of the monthly operating lease payments is not
being recognized as rent expense
 but rather is allocated to reduce this financial liability and recognize imputed interest expense.
For the year ended December 31
 2019
 $0.5 million of our lease payments was allocated to reduce the financial liability.

Our
financing activities provided net cash proceeds of $96.4 million for the year ended December 31
 2018. For the year ended December
31
 2018
 the principal sources of cash from our financing activities consisted of (i) $99.9 million from four public offerings
that resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of 34.7 million shares of our Common Stock
 (ii) $5.0 million for borrowings under
the Siena Revolver
 and (iii) $4.6 million from a convertible debt financing in June 2018. These financing cash proceeds totaled
$109.5 million and were partially offset by cash payments for (i) principal paid under the Siena Revolver of $3.0 million
 (ii)
principal and make-whole premium in August 2018 to repay the convertible debt financing for $4.9 million
 (iii) payment to terminate
our revolver with U.S. Bank for $2.0 million in June 2018
 (iv) payment of $2.2 million for incremental and direct offering costs
associated with the public offerings
 and (v) payment of debt issuance costs associated with the Siena Revolver for $0.6 million.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

During
the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships
such as structured finance or special purpose entities
balance
sheet arrangements.

Foreign
Currency Risks

We
have foreign currency risks related to our net revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar
primarily the Euro
 Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen. We generated approximately 72% of our net revenue from our international business
for the year ended December 31
 2019. Increases in the relative value of the U.S. Dollar to other currencies may negatively affect
our net revenue
 partially offset by a positive impact to operating expenses in other currencies as expressed in U.S. Dollars.
We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of transaction gains or
losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances
 including intercompany receivables and payables
which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. While we have
not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date
 we are evaluating such a program and may in the future
hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

Our
management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial
statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
as well as the reported net revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed for changes
in facts and circumstances
 and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We
believe that of our significant accounting policies that are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included
in Item 8 of this Report
 the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly
these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial
condition and results of operations.

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired. Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or
more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds
its fair value. The goodwill impairment test is applied by performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value
of the reporting unit. If
 on the basis of qualitative factors
 it is considered more likely than not that the fair value of the
reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount
In
the course of preparing our annual goodwill impairment testing
 if we project a sustained decline in a reporting unit&rsquo;s
revenues and earnings
 it will have a significant negative impact on the fair value of the reporting unit which could result in
material future impairment charges for our goodwill and long-lived assets. Such a decline could be driven by
 among other things:
(i) changes in strategic priorities; (ii) anticipated decreases in product pricing
 sales volumes
 and long-term growth rates
as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; and (iii) the inability to achieve
 or delays in achieving the goals of
our strategic initiatives and synergies. Adverse changes to macroeconomic factors
 such as increases to long-term interest rates

unit exceeds the reporting unit&rsquo;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess
 limited
to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.



    
    



Identifiable
intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at the estimated acquisition date fair value. Finite lived intangible
assets are amortized over the shorter of the contractual life or their estimated useful life using the straight-line method
 which
is determined by identifying the period over which the cash flows from the asset are expected to be generated.

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets


Long-lived
assets include identifiable intangible assets
 property and equipment
 and right-of-use assets. Under our accounting policies
at least quarterly we consider whether events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate if it is &ldquo;more likely
than not&rdquo; that an impairment of our long-lived assets has occurred. Evaluating whether impairment exists involves substantial
judgment and estimation. Impairment exists for identifiable intangible assets
 property and equipment and right-of-use assets
if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by
such assets. If impairment is determined to exist
 then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset
 or asset group
 exceeds its fair value. Fair value of our long-lived assets is determined using the fair
value concepts set forth in ASC 820
 

Revenue
Recognition

We
recognize product sales when we satisfy our performance obligations and transfer control of the promised products to our customers
which generally occurs over a very short period of time. Performance obligations are typically satisfied by shipping or delivering
products to customers
 which is also the point when title transfers to customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration
expected to be received in exchange for transferring the related products.

Net
revenue consists of the gross sales price
 less estimated returns and allowances for which provisions are made at the time of
sale
 and less certain other discounts
 allowances
 and personal rebates that are accounted for as a reduction from gross revenue.
Shipping and handling charges that are billed to our customers are included as a component of revenue. Costs incurred by us for
shipping and handling charges are included in cost of goods sold.

Payments
received for undelivered or back-ordered products are recorded as deferred revenue. Our policy is to defer revenue related to
distributor convention fees
 payments received on products ordered in the current period but not delivered until the subsequent
period
 initial IPC fees
 IPC renewal fees and internet subscription fees until the products or services have been provided.



Inventories
are adjusted to the lower of cost and net realizable value
 using the first-in
 first-out method. The components of inventory
cost include raw materials
 labor and overhead. The determination of net realizable value involves various assumptions related
to excess or slow-moving inventories
 non-conforming inventories
 expiration dates
 current and future product demand
 production
planning
 and market conditions. If future demand and market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions
 additional inventory
adjustments could be required in future periods.

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
measure the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for all equity awards granted
 including stock options
based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. We compute the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model. We recognize the cost of the equity awards over the period that services are provided to earn the award
usually the vesting period. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting schedule
 and the only condition for vesting is
a service condition
 compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
as if the award was
 in substance
 a single award. We recognize the impact of forfeitures in the period that the forfeiture occurs
rather than estimating the number of awards that are not expected to vest in accounting for stock-based compensation.

Income
Taxes


We
account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted
tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Realization
of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of a deferred income tax asset will not be realized based on the weight of available evidence
including expected future earnings.

We
recognize an uncertain tax position in our financial statements when we conclude that a tax position is more likely than not to
be sustained upon examination based solely on its technical merits. Only after a tax position passes the first step of recognition
will measurement be required. Under the measurement step
 the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is
more likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement. This is determined on a cumulative probability basis. The full
impact of any change in recognition or measurement is reflected in the period in which such change occurs. Interest and penalties
related to income taxes are recognized in the provision for income taxes.


    
    



Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

From
time to time
 new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 of this Report
 we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. For additional information on
recently issued accounting standards and our plans for adoption of those standards

Accounting Pronouncements

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

The
primary purpose of using non-GAAP financial measures is to provide supplemental information that we believe may be useful to investors
and to enable investors to evaluate our results in the same way we do. We also present the non-GAAP financial measures because
we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis
 as well as comparing
our results against the results of other companies
 by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating
performance. Specifically
 we use these non-GAAP measures as measures of operating performance; to prepare our annual operating
budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; to evaluate the effectiveness of our business
strategies; to provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance; to facilitate a comparison of our results
with those of other companies
 many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and in
communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Investors should be aware however
 that not all
companies define these non-GAAP measures consistently.

We
provide in the tables below a reconciliation from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial
measure presented. Due to a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets
 there were no income tax effects associated with
any of our non-GAAP adjustments.

 we also exclude the following items for the periods presented:

Compensation Expense
directors and consultants. This strategy is principally aimed at aligning the employee interests with those of our stockholders
and to achieve long-term employee retention
 rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period.
As a result

in any particular period.

New
Age Beverages Corporation

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of New Age Beverages Corporation (the Company) as of December 31
 2018
and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss
 stockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows for the
year then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion
 the financial statements
present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31

 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE
1 &mdash; NATURE OF OPERATIONS 



New
Age Beverages Corporation (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was formed under the laws of the State of Washington on April 26
 2010.
On December 21
 2018
 the Company completed a business combination with Morinda Holdings
 Inc.
 a Utah corporation (&ldquo;Morinda&rdquo;).
The Company is a healthy beverages and lifestyles company engaged in the development and commercialization of a portfolio of organic
natural and other better-for-you healthy beverages
 liquid dietary supplements
 cannabidiol (&ldquo;CBD&rdquo;) topical products
and other healthy lifestyle products. On July 10
 2019
 the Company completed a business combination with Brands Within Reach
LLC (&ldquo;BWR&rdquo;). For further information about the Morinda and BWR business combinations
 please refer to Note 4.

Legal
Structure
 Regulation and Consolidation

The
Company has four direct subsidiaries
 all of which are wholly-owned. These subsidiaries consist of NABC
 Inc.
 NABC Properties
LLC (&ldquo;NABC Properties&rdquo;)
 Morinda and BWR. NABC
 Inc. is a Colorado-based operating company that consolidates performance
and financial results of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries and divisions. NABC Properties administers a building owned by the Company
in southern Colorado. BWR is a component of the NewAge segment and owns key licensing and distribution rights in the United States

 New Age Health
Sciences
 Inc.
 was merged with and into NABC
 Inc. in November 2019.

The
Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies
 including the U.S.&nbsp;Food and
Drug Administration; Federal Trade Commission; Consumer Product Safety Commission; federal
 state
 and local taxing agencies;
and others. In addition
 the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by a number of foreign government agencies.

The
consolidated financial statements
 which include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
 are prepared
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;). All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.



The
Company&rsquo;s chief operating decision maker (the &ldquo;CODM&rdquo;)
 who is the Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer
 allocates
resources and assesses performance based on financial information of the Company. The CODM reviews financial information presented
for each reportable segment for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Upon consummation
of the business combination with Morinda in December 2018
 the Company&rsquo;s CODM began assessing performance and allocating
resources based on the financial information of two operating segments
 the Morinda segment and the NewAge segment. In 2020
 the
Morinda segment began doing business as Noni by NewAge. As a result of this change
 all references to the former Morinda segment
are referred to herein as the Noni by NewAge segment.

These
two reportable segments focus on the sale of distinctly different beverage products and are managed separately because they have
different marketing strategies
 customer bases
 and economic characteristics. Please refer to Note 15 for additional information
about the Company&rsquo;s operating segments.


    
    








NOTE
2 &mdash; SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make judgments
assumptions
 and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The
Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience
 and various other factors that it believes
are reasonable under the circumstances
 to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The Company&rsquo;s significant accounting estimates include
 but are not necessarily limited to
 impairment
of goodwill and long-lived assets; valuation assumptions for earnout obligations and assets acquired in business combinations;
valuation assumptions for stock options
 warrants and equity instruments issued for goods or services; estimated useful lives
for identifiable intangible assets and property and equipment; allowances for sales returns
 chargebacks and inventory obsolescence;
deferred income taxes and the related valuation allowances; and the evaluation and measurement of contingencies. To the extent
there are material differences between the Company&rsquo;s estimates and the actual results
 the Company&rsquo;s future consolidated
results of operation will be affected.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents


All
highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less that are freely available for the Company&rsquo;s
immediate and general business use are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Cash consists of demand deposits with financial
institutions. Cash equivalents consist of short-term certificates of deposit.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

The
Company records a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectability
of its accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts
 the Company considers
 among other factors
 the
aging of the accounts receivable
 its historical write-offs
 the credit worthiness of customers
 and general economic conditions.
Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes that it is probable that the receivable will
not be recovered.



Inventories
are adjusted to the lower of cost and net realizable value
 using the first-in
 first-out method. The components of inventory
cost include raw materials
 labor and overhead. The determination of net realizable value involves various assumptions related
to excess or slow-moving inventories
 non-conforming inventories
 expiration dates
 current and future product demand
 production
planning
 and market conditions. If future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management&rsquo;s assumptions
additional inventory adjustments could be required in future periods.

Identifiable
Intangible Assets

Identifiable
intangible assets are recorded at the estimated acquisition date fair value. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over
the shorter of the contractual life or their estimated useful life using the straight-line method
 which is determined by identifying
the period over which the cash flows from the intangible asset are expected to be generated.

In
connection with the Company&rsquo;s business combinations
 identifiable intangible assets were acquired that were recorded at
estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. These assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives as follows:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    



    
    









Property
and Equipment


Property
and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 as follows:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    


Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset
 whichever is shorter. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation commences when assets are initially placed into service for their intended
use.



Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually on December 31 of each year
 or more frequently when events
or circumstances indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The goodwill
impairment test is applied by performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If
on the basis of qualitative factors
 it is considered more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater
than the carrying amount
 further testing of goodwill for impairment is not required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit
exceeds the reporting unit&rsquo;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess
 limited to
the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.



The
Company determines if contractual arrangements are considered a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in right-of-use
(&ldquo;ROU&rdquo;) assets
 whereas assets related to finance leases are included in property and equipment. ROU assets represent
the Company&rsquo;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the related obligations
to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement
date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Most of the Company&rsquo;s leases do not set forth an
implicit interest rate
 which requires use of the Company&rsquo;s estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present
value of lease payments. The Company has a central treasury function and determines the incremental borrowing rate based on local
economic conditions in the jurisdiction of the related leased property.

When
lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised
 the ROU calculations
give effect to such options. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Some
of the Company&rsquo;s lease agreements contain lease and non-lease components
 which are generally accounted for separately.
However
 for certain leases
 the Company elects to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Additionally
 for certain equipment leases
 the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating
lease ROU assets and liabilities.

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets


Long-lived
assets consist of identifiable intangible assets
 property
 equipment
 and ROU assets
 which are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists for long-lived
assets if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated
by such assets. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
 or asset group
 exceeds
its fair value.


    
    







Debt
Issuance Costs and Discounts

Debt
issuance costs are costs incurred to obtain new debt financing or modify existing debt agreements and consist of incremental direct
costs incurred for professional fees and due diligence services
 including reimbursement of similar costs incurred by the lenders.
Amounts paid to the lenders when a financing is consummated are a reduction of the proceeds and are treated as a debt discount.
Except for revolving lines of credit
 debt issuance costs and discounts are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets as a reduction in the carrying value of the debt and are accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method.
Debt issuance costs related to revolving lines of credit are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a long-term
asset and are amortized using the straight-line method over the contractual term of the debt agreement. Unamortized deferred debt
issuance costs are not charged to expense when the related debt becomes a demand obligation due to the violation of terms so long
as it is probable that the lenders will either waive the violation or will agree to amend or restructure the terms of the indebtedness.
If either circumstance is probable
 the deferred debt issuance costs continue to be amortized over the remaining term of the initial
amortization period. If it is not probable
 the costs will be charged to expense.

Deferred
Offering Costs

Commissions
legal fees and other costs that are directly associated with equity offerings are capitalized as deferred offering costs
 pending
a determination of the success of the offering. Deferred offering costs related to successful offerings are charged to additional
paid-in capital in the period it is determined that the offering was successful. Deferred offering costs related to unsuccessful
equity offerings are recorded as expense in the period when it is determined that an offering is unsuccessful.

Restricted
Cash

tricted
cash primarily represents long-term cash deposits held in a bank for a foreign governmental agency. This restricted cash is required
to maintain the Company&rsquo;s direct selling license to do business in China.

Revenue
Recognition

Product
sales are recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligations and transfers control of the promised products to
its customers
 which generally occurs over a very short period of time. Performance obligations are typically satisfied by shipping
or delivering products to customers
 which is also the point when title transfers to customers. Revenue is measured as the amount
of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring the related products.

Revenue
consists of the gross sales price
 less estimated returns and allowances for which provisions are made at the time of sale
 and
less certain other discounts
 allowances
 and personal rebates that are accounted for as a reduction from gross revenue. Shipping
and handling charges that are billed to customers are included as a component of revenue. Costs incurred by the Company for shipping
and handling charges are included in cost of goods sold.

Payments
received for undelivered or back-ordered products are recorded as deferred revenue. The Company&rsquo;s policy is to defer revenue
related to distributor convention fees
 payments received on products ordered in the current period but not delivered until the
subsequent period
 initial independent product consultants (&ldquo;IPC&rdquo;) fees
 IPC renewal fees and internet subscription
fees until the products or services have been provided. Deferred revenue is included in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets and amounted to $1.4 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Customer
Programs and Incentives

The
Company incurs customer program costs to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive pricing. Amounts paid in connection
with customer programs and incentives are recorded as reductions to revenue or as advertising
 promotional and selling expenses
based on the nature of the expenditure. The Company accounts for volume rebates made to its IPCs
 and similar discounts and incentives
as a reduction of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Sales
and Marketing Expenses

Advertising
promotional and selling expenses consisted of media advertising costs
 sales and marketing expenses
 and promotional activity
expenses and are recognized in the period incurred. The Company accrues expenses for incentive trips associated with Morinda&rsquo;s
direct sales marketing program
 which rewards certain IPCs with paid attendance at its conventions
 meetings
 and retreats. Expenses
associated with incentive trips are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned. The Company specifically analyzes incentive
trip accruals based on historical and current sales trends as well as contractual obligations when evaluating the adequacy of
the incentive trip accrual. Actual results could result in liabilities being more or less than the amounts recorded.


    
    






Research
and Development

Research
and development costs are primarily related to development of new product formulas. All research and development costs are expensed
as incurred and amounts incurred through December 31
 2019 have not been material.

Loss
and Gain Contingencies 

The
Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss
contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired
 or a liability has been incurred
 and the amount of
loss can be reasonably estimated. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount
within the range
 the Company accrues that amount. Alternatively
 when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better
estimate than any other amount
 the Company accrues the lowest amount in the range. If the Company determines that a loss is reasonably
possible and the range of the loss is estimable
 then the Company discloses the range of the possible loss. If the Company cannot
estimate the range of loss
 it will disclose the reason why it cannot estimate the range of loss. The Company regularly evaluates
current information available to it to determine whether an accrual is required
 an accrual should be adjusted and if a range
of possible loss should be disclosed. Legal fees related to contingencies are charged to general and administrative expense as
incurred.

Contingencies
that may result in gains are not recognized until realization is assured
 which typically requires collection in cash.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The
Company measures the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for all equity awards granted
 including stock
options
 based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. The Company computes the fair value of options using
the Black-Scholes-Merton (&ldquo;BSM&rdquo;) option pricing model. The Company recognizes the cost of the equity awards over the
period that services are provided to earn the award
 usually the vesting period. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting
schedule
 and the only condition for vesting is a service condition
 compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period as if the award was
 in substance
 a single award. The Company recognizes the impact of
forfeitures in the period that the forfeiture occurs
 rather than estimating the number of awards that are not expected to vest
in accounting for stock-based compensation.



The
Company holds derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps. The Company uses interest rate swaps to economically
convert variable interest rate debt to a fixed rate. The Company has not designated these derivatives as hedging instruments.
The interest rate swaps are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. When the Company enters into
a financial instrument such as a debt or equity agreement (the &ldquo;host contract&rdquo;)
 the Company assesses whether the
economic characteristics of any embedded features are clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the
remainder of the host contract. When it is determined that (i) an embedded feature possesses economic characteristics that are
not clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the host contract
 and (ii) a separate
 stand-alone
instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a financial derivative instrument
 then the embedded feature is bifurcated
from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument. The estimated fair value of the derivative feature is recorded
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets separately from the carrying value of the host contract. Subsequent changes in
the estimated fair value of derivatives are recorded as a non-operating gain or loss in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated statements
of operations.


    
    





Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 740
 Income Taxes
under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and
benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes
 the Company considers
tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates
 estimates of future taxable income
 and available tax planning
strategies. If tax regulations
 operating results
 or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary
 adjustments to the
carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely
than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The recorded valuation allowance is based on significant estimates and
judgments and if the facts and circumstances change
 the valuation allowance could materially change. In accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes
 the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant
tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than
not threshold
 the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued
on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Foreign
Currency Translation

The
Company&rsquo;s reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar
 while the functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries are their respective
local currencies. A majority of Morinda&rsquo;s business operations occur outside the United States. The local currency of each
of the Morinda&rsquo;s international subsidiaries and branches is used as its functional currency. All assets and liabilities
are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at the consolidated balance sheet date
 and net revenue and expenses
are translated at monthly average exchange rates. The resulting net foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders&rsquo; equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and
losses from foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains (losses) on short-term intercompany borrowings
 are recorded
in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The tax effect has not been material
to date.

Loss
Per Common Share

Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for each period presented. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by giving effect to all
potential shares of Common Stock
 including unvested restricted stock awards
 stock options
 convertible debt
 Preferred Stock
and warrants
 to the extent dilutive.

impairment test and eliminating the requirement for a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative
assessment. Under ASU 2017-04
 goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying amount whereby an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&rsquo;s
fair value; however
 the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition
income tax effects are considered
 if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those
fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2019. Effective October 1
 2019
 the Company early adopted this new guidance prospectively
for its annual goodwill impairment testing which resulted in impairment expense of $44.9 million that is included in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31
 2019. Please refer to Note 6 for further discussion.

NOTE
3 &mdash; LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN

If
the Company does not successfully execute its business plan
 certain assets may not be recoverable
 certain liabilities may not
be paid and investments in its capital stock may not be recoverable. The Company&rsquo;s success depends upon the acceptance of
its expertise in creating products and brands that consumers want to buy
 development of sales and distribution channels
 and
its ability to generate significant net revenue and cash flows from the use of this expertise.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company incurred a net loss of $89.8 million and net cash used in operating activities amounted
to $31.8 million. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had an accumulated deficit of $112.5 million. As of December 31
 2019
the Company had contractual obligations of approximately $21.6 million that are due during the year ending December 31
 2020.
This amount includes (i) payables to the former stockholders of Morinda of $5.7 million as discussed in Note 4
 (ii) operating
lease payments of $8.4 million
 (iii) principal and estimated interest payments of $2.8 million due under the EWB Credit Facility
discussed in Note 8
 (iv) open purchase orders for inventories of $3.4 million
 and (v) payments under certain employment agreements
of $1.3 million. Our contractual obligations discussed above exclude discretionary principal payments under the EWB Revolver for
$9.7 million that were paid on January 2
 2020 and which can be reborrowed subject to the terms of the EWB Credit Facility.

AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As
discussed in Note 16
 the Company entered into the third amendment and waiver (the &ldquo;Third Amendment&rdquo;) to the EWB Credit
Facility in March 2020. The Third Amendment is expected to have a significant impact on the Company&rsquo;s liquidity and capital
resources for the year ending December 31
 2020. The Third Amendment requires the Company to maintain an aggregate of $15.1 million
in restricted cash balances with EWB. The Third Amendment also requires equity infusions of $10.0 million for the fiscal quarter
ending March 31
 2020 (of which $6.3 million was received in January 2020). Cumulative equity infusions are required for $20.0
million and $30.0 million for the six- and nine-month periods ending June 30
 2020 and September 30
 2020
 respectively. Management
intends to raise the total required equity infusions of $30.0 million through the ATM Offering Agreement discussed in Note 9.
The ATM Offering Agreement is scheduled to terminate on April 30
 2020
 but management intends to seek an extension. The Company
may also undertake other types of equity offerings to meet the requirements for equity infusions.

As
of December 31
 2019
 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $60.8 million and working capital amounted to $33.5 million.
Management believes existing cash resources combined with expected proceeds under the ATM Offering Agreement will be sufficient
to fund the restricted cash required by EWB of $15.1 million
 contractual obligations of $21.6 million
 and working capital requirements
through March 2021. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing through equity offerings
and debt financings in the future. Even if these financing sources are available
 they may be on terms that are not acceptable
to the Company&rsquo;s board of directors and stockholders.

NOTE
4 &mdash; BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

The
Company completed business combinations with BWR in July 2019 and Morinda in December 2018. Both of these business combinations
were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805
 
 and using the fair
value concepts set forth in ASC 820
. The key terms of each of these business combinations is discussed
below.

Brands
Within Reach
 LLC

On
May 30
 2019
 the Company and BWR Acquisition Corp.
 a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&ldquo;BWR Merger Sub&rdquo;) entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;) with Brands Within Reach
 LLC (&ldquo;BWR&rdquo;)
 and
Olivier Sonnois
 the sole owner of BWR (&ldquo;Mr. Sonnois&rdquo;). At the closing on July 10
 2019 (the &ldquo;BWR Closing Date&rdquo;)
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed resulting in the merger of BWR Merger Sub with and into BWR
and BWR became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the &ldquo;BWR Merger&rdquo;). This closing of the transaction was accounted
for using the acquisition method of accounting based on ASC 805
 
 and using the fair value concepts
set forth in ASC 820
. The Company entered into the Merger Agreement primarily to acquire certain
key licensing and distribution rights in the United States for some of the world&rsquo;s leading beverage brands.

In
connection with the Merger Agreement
 the Company made a loan to BWR in the amount of $1.0 million in June 2019. The Merger Agreement
provided that if BWR&rsquo;s working capital set forth on its opening balance sheet was negative
 then the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable by the Company would be reduced from 700
000 shares to account for the deficiency. The opening balance sheet
resulted in negative working capital of approximately $2.5 million
 which resulted in a reduction of the number of shares issued
at closing to 107
602 shares. Accordingly
 the estimated fair value of the shares was approximately $453
000 based on the fair
value of the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock of $4.21 per share on the BWR Closing Date. The Merger Agreement also provided for a
cash payment of $0.5 million to the former owner of BWR.

Morinda
Holdings
 Inc.

On
December 2
 2018
 the Company entered into a Plan of Merger (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;) with Morinda and New Age Health
Sciences Holdings
 Inc.
 a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&ldquo;Merger Sub&rdquo;). On December 21
 2018 (the &ldquo;Closing
Date&rdquo;)
 the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed. Merger Sub was merged with and into Morinda
and Morinda became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. This transaction is referred to herein as the &ldquo;Merger.&rdquo;

Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement
 the Company paid to Morinda&rsquo;s equity holders (i) $75.0 million in cash; (ii) 2
016
480 shares of
the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock with an estimated fair value on the Closing Date of approximately $11.0 million
 (iii) 43
804
shares of Series D Preferred Stock (the &ldquo;Preferred Stock&rdquo;) providing for the potential payment of up to $15 million
contingent upon Morinda achieving certain post-closing milestones
 as discussed below.


    
    


NEW
AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Pursuant
to the Certificate of Designations of Series D Preferred Stock (the &ldquo;CoD&rdquo;)
 the holders of the Preferred Stock were
entitled to receive a dividend of up to an aggregate of $15.0 million (the &ldquo;Milestone Dividend&rdquo;) if the Adjusted EBITDA
(as defined in the CoD) of Morinda was at least $20.0 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. If the Adjusted EBITDA of
Morinda was less than $20.0 million
 the Milestone Dividend was reduced by applying a five-times multiple to the difference between
the Adjusted EBITDA target of $20 million and actual Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019. Accordingly
 no Milestone
Dividend is payable if actual Adjusted EBITDA is $17.0 million or lower. Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda for the year ended December
31
 2019 was less than $17.0 million and
 accordingly
 no Milestone Dividend was payable to the holders of the Preferred Stock.

Additionally
the Company was required to pay a quarterly dividend to the holders of the Preferred Stock at a rate of 1.5% per annum of the
Milestone Dividend amount
 payable on a pro rata basis. The Company may choose to pay the Milestone Dividend and /or the annual
dividend in cash or in kind
 provided that if the Company chooses to pay in kind
 the shares of Common Stock issued as payment
therefore must be registered under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;). The Preferred Stock
terminates on April 15
 2020. The annual cash dividend is payable on April 15
 2020.

Prior
to the Merger
 Morinda was an S corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly
 Morinda&rsquo;s taxable
earnings were reported on the individual income tax returns of the stockholders who were responsible for payment of the related
income tax liabilities. In December 2018
 Morinda agreed to distribute to its stockholders approximately $39.6 million of its
previously-taxed S corporation earnings whereby distributions are payable (i) up to $25.0 million for which the timing and amount
are subject to a future financing event
 and (ii) approximately $14.6 million based on the calculation of excess working capital
(&ldquo;EWC&rdquo;) as of the Closing Date. EWC is the amount by which Morinda&rsquo;s actual working capital (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) on the Closing Date exceeds $25.0 million. The Closing Date balance sheet of Morinda indicated that EWC was
approximately $14.6 million as of the Closing Date.

Under
ASC 805
 acquisition-related transaction costs (e.g.
 advisory
 legal and other professional fees) are not included as a component
of consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which such costs are incurred. In connection
with the Merger
 the Company incurred transaction costs of $3.2 million
 including (i) payment of cash of $1.1 million and issuance
of 214
250 shares of Common Stock with a fair value of $1.2 million to a financial advisor that assisted with the consummation
of the Merger
 and (ii) professional fees and other incremental and direct costs associated with the Merger of $0.9 million.

Based
    on the report of an independent valuation specialist
 the fair value of work-in-process and finished goods inventories on
    the closing dates exceeded the historical carrying value by approximately $0.2 million for BWR and $2.2 million for Morinda.
    These amounts represent an element of built-in profit on the closing dates and were charged to cost of goods sold as the related
    inventories were subsequently sold. The fair value of inventories was determined using both the &ldquo;cost approach&rdquo;
    and the &ldquo;market approach&rdquo;.

    
    
The
    fair value of identifiable intangible assets was determined based on the reports of an independent valuation specialist
 primarily
    using variations of the &ldquo;income approach
&rdquo; which is based on the present value of the future after-tax cash flows
    attributable to each identifiable intangible asset.

    
    
Fair
    value of Morinda&rsquo;s real estate properties amounted to $44.4 million and was based upon real estate appraisals prepared
    by an independent firm
 primarily using the &ldquo;income approach&rdquo;. Fair value of other property and equipment amounted
    to $10.9 million and was based primarily on the report of an independent valuation specialist with fair value determined using
    both the &ldquo;cost approach&rdquo; and the &ldquo;market approach.&rdquo;

    
    
BWR&rsquo;s
    and Morinda&rsquo;s U.S. operations were previously taxed on the owners&rsquo; individual income tax returns whereby no deferred
    income tax assets or liabilities had been recognized for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly
 an adjustment
    of approximately $0.4 million for BWR and $9.9 million for Morinda has been reflected for net deferred income tax liabilities
    that resulted from differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of such assets and liabilities.
    

    
    
The
    Company assumed BWR&rsquo;s obligations under its existing line of credit in connection with the business combination. Shortly
    after the closing date
 the Company paid an aggregate of $2.5 million to terminate the line of credit and repay certain other
    liabilities. 

    
    
Goodwill
    was recognized for the difference between the total purchase consideration transferred to consummate the business combinations
    and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the BWR and
    Morinda business combinations are not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The
    Company is obligated to make a one-time earnout payment of $1.25 million over a period of two years beginning at such time
    that revenue for the Marley reporting unit is equal to or greater than $15.0 million during any trailing twelve calendar month
    period. Revenue for the Marley reporting unit is not currently expected to exceed the $15.0 million earnout threshold
 which
    resulted in the elimination of the liability during 2019. The fair value of the Marley earnout as of December 31
 2018 was
    valued using the weighted average return on assets for a total of $0.9 million. Changes in fair value of the Marley earnout
    resulted in a gain of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31
 2019 and an expense of $0.1 million for the year ended
    December 31
 2018.

    
    
Interest
    was imputed on these obligations based on a credit and tax adjusted interest rate of 6.1% for the period from the Closing
    Date until the respective contractual or estimated payment dates. This discount is being accreted using the effective interest
    method. Accretion of discount related to these obligations amounted to an aggregate of $1.2 million for the year ended December
    31
 2019
 which is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

    
    
As
    of December 31
 2018
 the fair value of earnout consideration under the Series D Preferred Stock was determined by an independent
    valuation specialist using an option pricing model. Key inputs in the valuation included forecast annual EBITDA of Morinda
    expected volatility of forecast annual EBITDA of 10.0%
 the risk-free interest rate of 2.6%
 a discount rate applicable to
    forecast annual EBITDA of 21.5%
 a risk premium of 18.9%
 and an estimated credit spread of 5.7%. As of December 31
 2019
    it was determined that Morinda&rsquo;s EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019 was less than $17.0 million and therefore
    no Milestone Dividend was payable. Accordingly
 the fair value of the Morinda earnout of $0.2 million was solely attributable
    to the 1.5% dividend set forth in the Series D Preferred Stock.

    
    
Pursuant
    to a separate agreement between the parties prior to the consummation of the Merger
 Morinda agreed to pay its former stockholders
    up to $25.0 million from the net proceeds of the sale leaseback discussed in Note 7. Since this amount was only payable from
    the proceeds of a long-term financing
 the net carrying value was classified in long-term liabilities as of December 31
 2018.

NOTE
6 &mdash;IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

Impairment
Assessment

Over
the past several years
 the Company invested in several business combinations to accelerate its core business strategy of developing
marketing
 selling
 and distributing healthy liquid dietary supplements and ready-to-drink beverages. The carrying value of the
NewAge segment included several reporting units with goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with an aggregate net carrying
value of $45.9 million as of December 31
 2019. These intangible assets primarily arose from a series of business combinations
between April 2015 and July 2019.

During
the fourth quarter of 2019
 the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing in conjunction with its annual budget
process to reassess strategic priorities and forecast future operating performance and capital spending. Accordingly
 the Company
performed a quantitative assessment of the fair value of each of its reporting units in the NewAge and Noni by NewAge segments
as of December 31
 2019. Fair value of the reporting units was determined using the fair value concepts set forth in ASC 820
 based on the report of an independent valuation specialist. The valuation approach attributable
to each reporting unit used a weighted average from the &ldquo;income approach&rdquo; based on the present value of the future
after-tax cash flows
 and the &ldquo;market approach&rdquo; using the public company method.



    
    





As
a result of this valuation assessment
 the Company determined that an aggregate impairment charge of $44.9 million was required
to eliminate the net carrying value of all goodwill and substantially all identifiable intangible assets for all reporting units
in the NewAge segment. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 the changes in the net carrying value of identifiable intangible
assets and goodwill are as follows (in thousands):

    in July 2019
 as discussed in Note 4. Identifiable intangible assets of $0.8 million and goodwill of $2.0 million related
    to BWR are included in the impairment write-offs.

    
    
All

Marley
License Extension

On
March 28
 2019
 the Company extended a license agreement with Marley Merchandising LLC through March 31
 2030. As consideration
for the extension
 the Company issued a warrant that was immediately exercisable for 200
000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $5.14 per share. This warrant is exercisable for ten years and had a grant date fair value of $0.8 million
 which is
included in other license agreements in the identifiable intangible assets table above. This intangible asset is being amortized
over the remaining term of the Marley license. The fair value of the warrant was determined using the BSM option-pricing model.
Key assumptions included an expected term of five years
 volatility of 116%
 and a risk-free interest rate of 2.2%.

NOTE
7 &mdash; LEASES

The
Company leases various office and warehouse facilities
 vehicles and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements
that expire between January 2020 and March 2039. The Company has made accounting policy elections (i) to not apply the recognition
requirements for short-term leases and (ii) for facility leases
 when there are lease and non-lease components
 such as common
area maintenance charges
 to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. For the years ended December
31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had operating lease expense of $10.6 million and $1.6 million
 respectively.


    
    





Sale
Leaseback

On
March 22
 2019
 the Company entered into an agreement with a major Japanese real estate company resulting in the sale for approximately
$57.1 million of the land and building in Tokyo that serves as the corporate headquarters of Morinda&rsquo;s Japanese subsidiary.
Concurrently with the sale
 the Company entered into a lease of this property for a term of 27 years with the option to terminate
the lease any time after seven years. The monthly lease cost is &yen;20.0 million (approximately $184
000 based on the exchange
rate as of December 31
 2019) for the initial seven-year period of the lease term. After the seventh year of the lease term
 either
party may elect to adjust the monthly lease payment to the then current market rate for similar buildings in Tokyo. In order to
secure its obligations under the lease
 the Company provided a refundable security deposit of approximately $1.8 million. At any
time after the seventh year of the lease term
 the Company may elect to terminate the lease. However
 if the lease is terminated
 anniversary of the lease inception date
 then the Company will be obligated to perform certain restoration
obligations. The Company determined that the restoration obligation is a significant penalty whereby there is reasonable certainty
that the Company will not elect to terminate the lease prior to the 20-year anniversary. Therefore
 the lease term was determined
to be 20 years.

In
connection with this transaction
 the $2.6 million mortgage on the building was repaid at closing and the related interest rate
swap agreement discussed in Note 8 was cancelled
 the refundable security deposit of $1.8 million was paid at closing
 and the
Company became obligated to pay $25.0 million to the former stockholders of Morinda to settle the full amount of the contingent
financing liability discussed in Note 4. Other cash payments that have been or will be made include transaction costs of $1.9
million
 post-closing repair obligations of $1.7 million
 and Japanese income taxes of $11.9 million.

Recognized
    gain on sale

The
Company determined that $17.6 million of the $24.1 million gain on the sale of this property was the result of above-market rent
inherent in the leaseback arrangement. The remainder of the gain of $6.4 million was attributable to the highly competitive process
among the entities that bid to purchase the property
 and is included in gain from sale of property and equipment in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31
 2019.

The
$17.6 million portion of the gain related to above-market rent is being accounted for as a deferred lease financing obligation.
Accordingly
 the operating lease payments are allocated to (i) reduce the operating lease liability
 (ii) reduce the principal
portion of the deferred lease financing obligation
 and (iii) to recognize imputed interest expense at an incremental borrowing
rate of 3.5% on the deferred lease financing obligation over the 20-year lease term. The present value of the future lease payments
amounted to a gross operating lease liability of $25.0 million. After deducting the $17.6 million deferred lease financing obligations
the Company recognized an initial ROU asset and operating lease liability of approximately $7.4 million.

Impairment
of ROU Asset

In
June 2019
 the Company began attempting to sublease a portion of its ROU assets previously used for warehouse space that are no
longer needed for current operations. As a result
 an impairment evaluation was completed that resulted in recognition of an impairment
charge of $1.5 million in June 2019. This evaluation was based on the expected time to obtain a suitable subtenant and current
market rates for similar commercial properties. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company was continuing its efforts to obtain a subtenant
for this space. An updated impairment evaluation was performed
 which resulted in an additional impairment charge of $0.8 million
for total impairment of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31
 2019.

EWB
Credit Facility

On
March 29
 2019
 the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the &ldquo;EWB Credit Facility&rdquo;) with East West
Bank (&ldquo;EWB&rdquo;). The EWB Credit Facility matures on March 29
 2023 and provides for (i) a term loan in the aggregate
principal amount of $15.0 million
 which may be increased to $25.0 million subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (the
&ldquo;EWB Term Loan&rdquo;) and (ii) a $10.0 million revolving loan facility (the &ldquo;EWB Revolver&rdquo;). At the closing
EWB funded $25.0 million to the Company consisting of the $15.0 million EWB Term Loan and $10.0 million as an advance under the
EWB Revolver. The Company utilized a portion of the proceeds from the EWB Credit Facility to repay all outstanding amounts and
terminate the Siena Revolver discussed below.

The
obligations of the Company under the EWB Credit Facility are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and guaranteed
. The EWB
Credit Facility requires compliance with certain financial and restrictive covenants and includes customary events of default.
Key financial covenants include maintenance of minimum Adjusted EBITDA and a maximum Total Leverage Ratio (all as defined and
set forth in the EWB Credit Facility). During any period when an event of default occurs
 the EWB Credit Facility provides for
interest at a rate that is 3.0% above the rate otherwise applicable to such obligations. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company
was not in compliance with the minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant related to the EWB Credit Facility. As discussed in Note 16
 on
March 13
 2020 the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the EWB Credit Facility which included a waiver of non-compliance
with the minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant.


    
    





Borrowings
outstanding under the EWB Credit Facility bear interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.25%. However
 if the Total Leverage Ratio (as
defined in the EWB Credit Facility) is equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00
 borrowings will bear interest at the Prime Rate
plus 0.50%. As of December 31
 2019
 the prime rate was 4.75% and the contractual rate applicable to outstanding borrowings under
the EWB Credit Facility was 5.75%. As discussed below
 the Company has also entered into a swap agreement that provides for a
total notional amount of $10.0 million at a fixed interest rate of approximately 5.4% through May 1
 2023.

The
Company may voluntarily prepay amounts outstanding under the EWB Revolver without prepayment charges on ten business days&rsquo;
prior notice to EWB. In the event the EWB Revolver is terminated prior to the stated maturity date
 the Company would be required
to pay an early termination fee in the amount of 0.50% of the revolving line. Additional borrowing requests under the EWB Revolver
are subject to various customary conditions precedent
 including satisfaction of a borrowing base test as more fully described
in the EWB Credit Facility. The EWB Revolver also provides for an unused line fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the undrawn portion.
The EWB Revolver includes a subjective acceleration clause and a lockbox arrangement where the Company is required to direct its
customers to remit payments to a restricted bank account
 whereby all available funds are used to pay down the outstanding principal
balance under the EWB Revolver. Accordingly
 the entire outstanding principal balance of the EWB Revolver is classified as a current
liability as of December 31
 2019. On January 2
 2020
 the Company elected to make a voluntary prepayment of $9.7 million to repay
all outstanding borrowings under the EWB Revolver. Subject to the terms of the EWB Credit Facility
 the Company may reborrow up
to $10.0 million under the EWB Revolver through the stated maturity date.

Payments
under the EWB Term Loan were interest-only through September 30
 2019
 followed by monthly principal payments of $125
000 plus
interest through the stated maturity date of the EWB Term Loan. The Company may elect to prepay the EWB Term Loan before the stated
maturity date on 10 business days&rsquo; notice to EWB subject to a prepayment fee of 2% for the first year of the Term Loan and
1% for the second year of the Term Loan. No later than 120 days after the end of each fiscal year
 commencing with the fiscal
year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company is required to make a payment towards the outstanding principal amount of the EWB Term
Loan in an amount equal to 35% of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the EWB Credit Facility)
 if the Total Leverage Ratio is
less than 1.50 to 1.00
 or 50% of the Excess Cash Flow if the Total Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00. The
Company did not generate Excess Cash Flow for the year ended December 31
 2019 and
 accordingly
 no additional principal payments
were required. Mandatory principal payments based on Excess Cash Flow generated in subsequent quarters are excluded from current
liabilities since they are contingent payments based on the generation of working capital in the future.

Amendments
to EWB Credit Facility

On
August 5
 2019
 the Company entered into the first amendment to the EWB Credit Facility effective as of July 11
 2019
 pursuant
to which EWB waived any non-compliance by the Company with certain covenants in the EWB Credit Facility that may have occurred
or would otherwise arise as a result of the BWR Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the first amendment
 BWR entered into a Supplement
to Guarantee and Pledge and an Intellectual Property Security Agreement. On October 9
 2019
 the Company entered into a second
amendment to the EWB Credit Facility. Under the second amendment
 EWB waived (i) any default for failure to maintain at least
$5.0 million of net cash with EWB in the United States or in China during the period from July 25
 2019 to October 9
 2019 and
(ii) any default for failing to maintain primary operating accounts with EWB
 and ensuring that the Company&rsquo;s deposit and
investment accounts with third party financial institutions located in China contain no more than 40% of the Company&rsquo;s total
cash
 cash equivalents and investment balances maintained in China. The second amendment also amended the EWB Credit Facility
to (i) extend the time period to establish compliance with the operating account provisions until November 30
 2019
 (ii) to make
the covenants no longer applicable to the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries in China
 and (iii) to decrease the amount of net cash
from $5.0 million to $2.0 million that the Company is required to maintain with EWB on and after December 31
 2019. See Note 16
for discussion of the Third Amendment to the EWB Credit Facility.

Siena
Revolver

On
August 10
 2018
 the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Siena Lending Group LLC (&ldquo;Siena&rdquo;) that
provided for a $12.0 million revolving credit facility (the &ldquo;Siena Revolver&rdquo;) with a scheduled maturity date of August
10
 2021. Outstanding borrowings provided for interest at the greater of (i) 7.5% or (ii) the prime rate plus 2.75%. As of December
31
 2018
 the effective interest rate was 8.25%. Beginning on November 7
 2018
 the Company was required to pay interest on a
minimum of $2.0 million of borrowings
 regardless of whether such funds had been borrowed.

The
Siena Revolver was paid off and terminated on March 29
 2019
 and the unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.5 million were written
off as additional interest expense for the year ended December 31
 2019. Additionally
 the Company incurred a make-whole premium
payment of $0.5 million that was also charged to interest expense for the year ended December 31
 2019.


    
    





Embedded
Derivatives

The
Siena Revolver included features that were determined to be embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation and accounting as separate
financial instruments. The Company determined that embedded derivatives included the requirement to pay (i) an early termination
premium if the Siena Revolver is terminated before the stated maturity date
 and (ii) default interest at a 5.0% premium if events
of default existed. An early termination premium was required to be paid if Siena&rsquo;s commitment to make revolving loans was
terminated prior to the stated maturity date. The fee was equal to 4.00% of the $12.0 million commitment if termination occurred
during the first year after the closing date. These embedded derivatives were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value was estimated using the &ldquo;with&rdquo; and &ldquo;without&rdquo; method. Accordingly
 the Siena Revolver was first
valued with the embedded derivatives (the &ldquo;with&rdquo; scenario) and subsequently valued without the embedded derivatives
(the &ldquo;without&rdquo; scenario). The fair value of the embedded derivatives was estimated as the difference between these
two scenarios. The fair values were determined using the income approach
 specifically the yield method. As of December 31
 2018
key Level 3 assumptions and estimates used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives included an assessment of the probability
of early termination of the Siena Revolver
 the remaining term to maturity of approximately 2.6 years
 probability of default
of approximately 10%
 and a discount rate of 6.1%.

As
of December 31
 2018
 the embedded derivatives for the Siena Revolver had an aggregate fair value of approximately $0.5 million
which is included in accrued liabilities as of December 31
 2018. The Company recognized a loss on change in fair value of embedded
derivatives of $0.5 million which is included in non-operating expenses for the year ended December 31
 2018. As a result of the
termination of the Siena Revolver as discussed above
 a make-whole premium of $0.5 million was incurred on March 29
 2019
 and
the Company recognized a gain on change in fair value of embedded derivatives of $0.5 million which is included in non-operating
income (expenses) for the year ended December 31
 2019.

Interest
Rate Swap Agreements

The
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with EWB dated July 31
 2019. This swap agreement provides for a total notional
amount of $10.0 million at a fixed interest rate of approximately 5.4% through May 1
 2023
 in exchange for a floating rate indexed
to the prime rate plus 0.5%. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had an unrealized loss from this interest rate swap agreement
of approximately $0.1 million that is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

As
of December 31
 2018
 the Company had one contract for an interest rate swap with a total notional amount of approximately $2.6
million. At December 31
 2018
 the Company had an unrealized loss from this interest rate swap agreement of approximately $36
000
that is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As discussed in Note 7
 this swap
agreement was terminated upon sale of the property in Tokyo and repayment of the related mortgage.

Convertible
Note

On
June 20
 2018
 the Company issued a senior secured convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;Convertible Note&rdquo;) with a principal
balance of $4.75 million and a maturity date of June 20
 2019. The Convertible Note provided for monthly payments of interest
only at 8.0% per annum
 and was collateralized by certain equipment
 general intangibles
 inventory
 and a security interest in
all of the Company&rsquo;s trademarks
 copyrights and patents. The Convertible Note was convertible into shares of Common Stock
at a conversion price of $1.89 per share.

After
payment of the lender&rsquo;s expenses of $0.2 million
 the Company received net proceeds from the Convertible Note of $4.6 million.
The Company also issued to the lender an aggregate of 226
190 shares of Common Stock with a fair value of approximately $0.4 million.
These amounts were accounted for as an aggregate discount of $0.6 million that was accreted to interest expense using the effective
interest method. On August 24
 2018
 the Company repaid the Convertible Note by paying an aggregate of approximately $5.0 million
which consisted of the principal balance of $4.75 million plus a make-whole penalty for early prepayment of $0.2 million. Due
to the early extinguishment of the Convertible Note
 the Company recognized accretion for all of the debt discount and issuance
costs of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31
 2018. The Company has no further obligations related to the Convertible
Note.

Public
Offerings of Common Stock

On
April 30
 2019
 the Company entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement (&ldquo;ATM Offering Agreement&rdquo;) with Roth
Capital Partners
 LLC (the &ldquo;Agent&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate
of $100 million in shares of the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock (the &ldquo;Placement Shares&rdquo;) through the Agent. The Agent
is acting as sales agent and is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell on the Company&rsquo;s behalf all of the

 and consultants. The 2019 Plan will terminate in April 2029. The 2019 Plan provides
for grants of both incentive stock options
 or &ldquo;ISOs&rdquo;
 which are subject to special income tax treatment
 and non-statutory
options
 or &ldquo;NSOs.&rdquo; Eligibility for ISOs is limited to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The exercise
price of ISOs and NSOs generally cannot be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of grant. In addition
the expiration date for ISOs and NSOs cannot be more than ten years after the date of the original grant. The administrator also
determines all other terms and conditions related to the exercise of an option
 including the consideration to be paid
 if any
for the grant of the option
 the time at which options may be exercised and conditions related to the exercise of options.

The
2019 Plan also provides for awards of shares of restricted Common Stock and restricted stock units. Awards of restricted stock
may be made in exchange for services or other lawful consideration. Generally
 awards of restricted stock are subject to the requirement
that the shares be forfeited or resold to the Company unless specified conditions are met. Subject to these restrictions
 conditions
and forfeiture provisions
 any recipient of a vested award of restricted stock will have all the rights of a stockholder of the
Company
 including the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends. The 2019 Plan also provides for deferred grants (&ldquo;deferred
stock&rdquo;) entitling the recipient to receive shares of Common Stock in the future on such conditions as the administrator
may specify. As of December 31

 8.0 million shares under the 2019 Plan were available for future grants of stock options

and three years after the grant date of such award. The number of shares reserved for grants is adjusted annually on the first
day of January whereby a maximum of 10% of the Company&rsquo;s outstanding shares of Common Stock are available for grant under

NEW
AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In
July 2019
 the Company entered into a modification agreement for approximately 292
000 shares of outstanding stock options. The
modification resulted in an extension of the exercise period from July 2019 until July 2020
 which increased the fair value of
the stock options by approximately $0.5 million. The modified options became vested in August 2019
 and the Company recognized
incremental stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31
 2019.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the valuation assumptions for stock options granted to employees and non-employees under the
Equity Incentive Plans and the modified options discussed above were estimated on the date of grant or modification
 as applicable
using the BSM option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:



    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    



Based
on the assumptions set forth above
 the weighted-average grant date fair value per share for stock options granted for the years
ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 was $1.99 and $4.05
 respectively. With respect to the stock options modified in July 2019
 the
fair value of the modified options increased by $1.80 per share in comparison to the fair value of the stock options immediately
before the modification.

The
BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions that represent management&rsquo;s best estimates of the fair value of
the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates
 expected term
 and dividend yield. The expected term represents
the weighted-average period that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules. Because
the Company does not have an extended history of actual exercises
 the Company has estimated the expected term using a simplified
method which calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the awards. The Company
has never declared or paid cash dividends and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future; therefore
 the Company
used an expected dividend yield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury rates in effect for maturities
based on the expected term of the grant. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company&rsquo;s
Common Stock for the period beginning in August 2016 when its shares were first publicly traded through the grant date of the
respective stock options.

As

 the Company has continued its position to return all foreign earnings to the U.S. parent company and has
recorded deferred tax liabilities of $0.5 million for foreign withholding taxes associated with foreign retained earnings and
cross-border payments.

Morinda
Business Combination

Before
the Company acquired Morinda on December 21
 2018
 Morinda&rsquo;s net earnings taxed for the U.S. and various state jurisdictions
were payable personally by the shareholders pursuant to an election under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;).
The Subchapter S election terminated upon closing of Morinda&rsquo;s business combination with the Company. Accordingly
 the Company
recognized net deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $10 million for differences between the income tax basis of the
assets and liabilities and the related balances for financial reporting purposes.

The
Company is required to pay taxes to the appropriate governmental entities on profits derived from Morinda&rsquo;s international
operations
 including foreign withholding taxes imposed on the remittance of earnings of Morinda&rsquo;s foreign subsidiaries
and withholding taxes imposed on royalty payments. The Company has recorded income tax liabilities for foreign withholding on
distributed earnings. The Company is also responsible for state income taxes and other taxes assessed at the Company level.

Net
deferred income tax assets consist solely of foreign net deferred income tax assets which are expected to be realized in the future
and that are included in long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31
 2019
the valuation allowance increased by $37.8 million
 primarily due to incremental net operating losses that were not considered
realizable. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 the net decrease in the valuation allowance of $2.2 million since
net operating loss carryforwards were considered realizable due to net deferred tax liabilities related to purchase accounting
for the Morinda business combination. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets
 management considers whether
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.

$62.4 million with approximately $26.3 million relating to foreign subsidiaries and approximately $36.1 million
relating to U.S. entities. The federal and state NOL carryforwards in the income tax returns filed included unrecognized tax benefits.
The deferred tax assets recognized for those NOLs are presented net of these unrecognized tax benefits. The NOLs will expire at
various dates from 2020 through 2039
 with the exception of those in some foreign jurisdictions where there is no expiration.
The U.S. NOLs have a full valuation allowance recorded against them. Of the $26.3 million foreign NOLs
 all but $2.3 million have
a valuation allowance recorded against them. Federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOL
and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for income tax purposes
 as defined in Section 382 of the Code.
Under the provisions of Section 382 and 383 of the Code
 a change in control
 as defined by the Code
 may impose an annual limitation
on the amount of the Company&rsquo;s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
 and other tax attributes that can be used
to reduce future tax liabilities. The Company has performed a preliminary Section 382 analysis. The preliminary calculations indicate
that the Company&rsquo;s NOLs do not appear to be subject to the limitation.

Management
assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to
permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. When weighing all available evidence
 associated with the realizability of its
deferred tax assets
 in particular
 uncertainties related to the future generation of taxable income
 the recent negative trends
in certain operating markets
 and the cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions
 the Company determined that it was not &ldquo;more
likely than not&rdquo; that it would be able to realize the tax benefits associated with certain of its net deferred tax assets.
On the basis of this evaluation
 a valuation allowance against the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions deferred tax assets has
been recorded to recognize only the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company will
continue to monitor its historical and forecast operating results in the U.S. to assess the realizability of its deferred tax
assets.

Unrecognized
Tax Benefits

As
of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the total outstanding balance for liabilities related to unrecognized income tax benefits was $1.5
million and $0.4 million
 respectively. Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 million
 if recognized
 would affect the effective tax
rate. Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.7 million
 if recognized
 would not affect the Company&rsquo;s effective tax rate since
the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance. The Company
accounts for interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax expense. The unrecognized
tax benefit as of December 31
 2019 includes an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million for interest and penalties
 all of which
was recognized for the year ended December 31
 2019. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes related to unrecognized
tax benefits in the next twelve months.

Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan

Morinda&rsquo;s
Board of Directors implemented an unfunded executive deferred compensation plan in 2009 for certain executives of Morinda. All
financial performance targets under the plan have been achieved. After the executives retire
 the deferred compensation obligation
is payable over a period up to 20 years. All executives covered under this plan have retired as of December 31
 2019
 and cash
payments do not commence until December 2020. As of December 31
 2019
 the obligations under this plan consist of $3.8 million
that is included in other long-term liabilities and $0.3 million included in other accrued current liabilities. As of December
31
 2018
 the entire liability related to this plan of $4.1 million was included in other long-term liabilities.

Consulting
Agreement

Concurrent
with the BWR business combination discussed in Note 4
 the Company entered into an independent contractor agreement (&ldquo;ICA&rdquo;)
that provides for the former sole owner of BWR
 Mr. Sonnois
 to serve as president of the Company&rsquo;s North American Brands
Division (&ldquo;NABD&rdquo;). The ICA provides for an initial term that expires in June 2022 with an option by either party to
renew on an annual basis thereafter. Under the ICA
 the Company was required to (i) grant 100
000 shares of restricted Common
Stock to Mr. Sonnois
 which vest over the initial three-year term of the ICA
 (ii) pay base compensation of $350
000 per year
(iii) pay annual short term performance bonuses between 25% and 100% of base salary depending on achievement of criteria established
by the Company
 (iv) annually issue stock options
 restricted stock or other annual long-term equity awards
 up to 25% of base
compensation with vesting over three years
 and (v) pay special performance incentives based on the future gross profit of NABD.

Commencing
on the effective date of the ICA
 the Company is required to provide special performance incentives to Mr. Sonnois consisting
of issuing unregistered shares of Common Stock with a fair value of $1.5 million if NABD&rsquo;s gross profit is $10.0 million
or more for the first 12 consecutive months of the agreement
 an additional $1.5 million of shares if NABD&rsquo;s gross profit
is $20.0 million or more for the first 24 consecutive months
 and an additional $2.0 million of shares if NABD&rsquo;s gross profit
is $35.0 million or more for the first 36 consecutive months of the agreement. All shares issued for the special performance incentives
will vest immediately upon achievement of the performance targets. If the Company elects not to terminate or not renew the ICA
a payment to Mr. Sonnois equal to six months of base compensation is required. Future bonuses and incentive compensation based
on future gross profit of NABD will be charged to expense in the period earned.

401(k)
Plan

Since
December 2018
 the Company has had a defined contribution employee benefit plan under section 401(k) of the Code (the &ldquo;401(k)
Plan&rdquo;). The 401(k) Plan covers all eligible U.S. employees who are entitled to participate at the beginning of the first
full quarter following commencement of employment. The Company matches contributions up to 3% of the participating employee&rsquo;s
compensation
 and these matching contributions vest over four years with 0% vested through the end of the first year of service
and 33% vesting upon completion of each of the next three years of service. Total contributions to the 401(k) Plan amounted to
$0.7 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. Total contributions to the 401(k) Plan were insignificant for the year ended
December 31
 2018.

Foreign
Benefit Plans

The
Noni by NewAge segment has an unfunded retirement benefit plan for the Company&rsquo;s Japanese branch that entitles substantially
all employees in Japan
 other than directors
 to retirement payments. The Noni by NewAge segment also has an unfunded retirement
benefit plan in Indonesia that entitles all permanent employees to retirement payments.

Upon
termination of employment
 the Noni by NewAge segment employees of the Japanese branch are generally entitled to retirement benefits
determined by reference to basic rates of pay at the time of termination
 years of service
 and conditions under which the termination
occurs. If the termination is involuntary or caused by retirement at the mandatory retirement age of 65
 the employee is entitled
to a greater payment than in the case of voluntary termination. Noni by NewAge segment employees in Indonesia whose service is
terminated are generally entitled to retirement benefits determined by reference to basic rates of pay at the time of termination
years of service and conditions under which the termination occurs. The unfunded benefit obligation for these defined benefit
pension plans was approximately $3.5 million and $3.0 million as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. Of these amounts
approximately $3.4 million and $2.9 million are included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

The
Company&rsquo;s operations are subject to numerous governmental rules and regulations in each of the countries it does business.
These rules and regulations include a complex array of tax and customs regulations as well as restrictions on product ingredients
and claims
 the commissions paid to the Company&rsquo;s IPCs
 labeling and packaging of products
 conducting business as a direct-selling
business
 and other facets of manufacturing and selling products. In some instances
 the rules and regulations may not be fully
defined under the law or are otherwise unclear in their application. Additionally
 laws and regulations can change from time to
time
 as can their interpretation by the courts
 administrative bodies
 and the tax and customs authorities in each country. The
Company actively seeks to be in compliance
 in all material respects
 with the laws of each of the countries in which it does
business and expects its IPCs to do the same. The Company&rsquo;s operations are often subject to review by local country tax
and customs authorities and inquiries from other governmental agencies. No assurance can be given that the Company&rsquo;s compliance
with governmental rules and regulations will not be challenged by the authorities or that such challenges will not result in assessments
or required changes in the Company&rsquo;s business that could have a material impact on its business
 consolidated financial
statements and cash flow.

The
Company has various non-income tax contingencies in several countries. Such exposure could be material depending upon the ultimate
resolution of each situation. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company has recorded a current liability under ASC 450
 
of approximately $0.9 million and $0.8 million
 respectively.

From
time to time
 the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although
the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty
 the Company currently believes that the final outcome
of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the outcome
 litigation
can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs
 diversion of management resources
 and other
factors.

Guarantee
Deposits

Morinda
has deposits in Korea for collateral on IPC returns dictated by law
 and collateral to credit card companies for guarantee of
IPC payments. Approximately $0.8 million of guarantee deposits are included in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31
 2019 and 2018.

NOTE
14 &mdash; FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS

Fair
Value Measurements

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value
 the Company considers the principal or most
advantageous market in which it transacts and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset
or liability. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy
 which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value
into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant
to the fair measurement:

Level
1&mdash;Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement
date

Level
2&mdash;Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability
 either directly or indirectly
through market collaboration
 for substantially the full term of the asset or liability

Level
3&mdash;Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not
available
 thereby allowing for situations in which there is little
 if any market activity for the asset or liability at measurement
date

As
of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the fair value of the Company&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents
 restricted cash
 accounts receivable
accounts payable
 and accrued liabilities approximated their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Cash equivalents consist of short-term certificates of deposit that are classified as Level 2. The recorded amounts for
the debt obligations in Notes 4 and 8 also approximated fair value due to the short-term maturities
 variable nature of the interest
rates and/or since the instruments had been recently negotiated. In addition
 the net assets acquired in the business combinations
discussed in Note 4 were recorded at fair market value on the date of the closings
 with key valuation assumptions discussed in
Note 4.

Recurring

Recurring
measurements of the fair value of assets and liabilities as of December 31
 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

Valuation
assumptions for the business combination liabilities are set forth in Note 4. Valuation assumptions for the interest rate swap
and the embedded derivative liabilities are set forth in Note 8. The Company&rsquo;s policy is to recognize asset or liability
transfers among Level 1
 Level 2 and Level 3 as of the actual date of the events or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
During the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had no transfers of its assets or liabilities between levels of
the fair value hierarchy.

Significant
Concentrations

A
substantial portion of the business acquired from Morinda is conducted in foreign markets
 exposing the Company to the risks of
trade or foreign exchange restrictions
 increased tariffs
 foreign currency fluctuations and similar risks associated with foreign
operations. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 approximately 72% of the Company&rsquo;s consolidated net revenue was generated
outside the United States
 primarily in the Asia Pacific market. Most of the Noni by NewAge&rsquo;s products have a component
of the Noni plant
 Juice
 MAX and other
noni-based beverage products are expected to comprise over 80% of net revenue of the Noni by NewAge segment for the foreseeable
future. However
 if consumer demand for these products decreases significantly or if the Company ceases to offer these products
without a suitable replacement
 the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial condition and operating results would be adversely
affected. The Company purchases fruit and other Noni-based raw materials from French Polynesia
 but these purchases of materials
are from a wide variety of individual suppliers with no single supplier accounting for more than 10% of its raw material purchases
during 2019. However
 as the majority of the raw materials are consolidated and processed at the Company&rsquo;s plant in Tahiti
the Company could be negatively affected by certain governmental actions or natural disasters if they occurred in that region
of the world. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 one customer comprised approximately 11% of the Company&rsquo;s consolidated
net revenue.

Financial
instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
 cash equivalents
 restricted
cash
 and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash
 cash equivalents and restricted cash at high-quality financial
institutions. Cash deposits
 including those held in foreign branches of global banks
 may exceed the amount of insurance provided
on such deposits. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had cash and cash equivalents with two financial institutions in the United
States with balances of $22.2 million and $1.4 million
 and two financial institutions in China with balances of $6.6 million
and $3.6 million. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company had cash and cash equivalents with a single financial institution in the
United States with a balance of $6.5 million
 and two financial institutions in China with balances of $14.5 million and $8.0
million. The Company has never experienced any losses related to its investments in cash
 cash equivalents and restricted cash.

Generally
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company&rsquo;s customer
base and their dispersion across different geographies and industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on certain
customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Company maintains reserves for potential bad debts.

Repayment
of EWB Revolver

On
January 2
 2020
 the Company elected to make a voluntary prepayment of $9.7 million to repay all outstanding borrowings under
the EWB Revolver.



In
December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in China. The spread of this virus began to cause some
business disruption through reduced net revenue in the Company&rsquo;s Asia Pacific market in January and February 2020. While
the disruption is currently expected to be temporary
 there is considerable uncertainty around the duration. Therefore
 while
the Company expects this matter to negatively impact its operating results. However
 the related financial impact and duration
cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Third
Amendment to Credit Facility

On
March 13
 2020
 the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the EWB Credit Facility discussed in Note 8. Under the Third Amendment
EWB waived the Company&rsquo;s failure to comply with the minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant for the 12-month period ended December
31
 2019. In addition
 the Third Amendment modified the Credit Facility as follows:



    
    
The
    Company is required to maintain an aggregate of $15.1 million in restricted cash accounts designated by EWB. The future requirement
    to maintain restricted cash will be reduced by the amount of future principal payments under the EWB Term Loan.

    
    
Less stringent requirements
    are applicable for future compliance with the minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant
 the maximum total leverage ratio
 and the
    fixed charge coverage ratio. Additionally
 compliance with the maximum total leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage
    ratio have been delayed until June 30
 2021.

    
    
The existing provision
    related to &ldquo;equity cures&rdquo; that may be employed to maintain compliance with financial covenants was increased from
    $5.0 million to $15.0 million for the year ending December 31
 2020
 and to $10.0 million per year for each calendar year
    thereafter.

    
    
The
    Company is required to obtain equity infusions for at least $15.0 million for the first six months of 2020
 of which
    $6.3 million was received in January 2020. In addition
 cumulative equity infusions of $30.0 million must be received for the year
    ending December 31
 2020.

    
    
The interest rate
    applicable to outstanding borrowings under the EWB Credit Facility increased from 0.5% to 2.0% in excess of the prime rate.
    If the Company subsequently complies for two consecutive fiscal quarters with both the maximum total leverage ratio and the
    fixed charge coverage ratio
 the interest rate will be reduced to 0.50% in excess of the prime rate (assuming that the Company&rsquo;s
    total leverage ratio is less than 1.50 to 1.00).


Offering
Agreement

In
connection with the ATM Offering Agreement discussed in Note 9
 for the period from January 1
 2020 through January 23
 2020
the Company sold an aggregate of approximately 3.5 million shares of Common Stock for net proceeds of approximately $6.3 million.

Employment
Agreement

On
January 13
 2020

operating officer. Pursuant to the employment agreement
 Mr. Vanderveen receives an annual base salary of $550
000
 and is eligible
to receive an annual performance-based cash bonus with a target bonus opportunity equal to a range from 50% to 200% of his annual
base salary
 based upon the attainment of certain performance goals. The employment agreement provides for &ldquo;at will&rdquo;
employment terminable by either party on 15 days&rsquo; notice. Mr. Vanderveen received an annual long-term incentive award equal
to 50% of his base salary in the form of the Company&rsquo;s restricted stock and stock options. As a sign-on incentive
 Mr. Vanderveen
also received a cash payment of $100
000
 the grant of 125
000 stock options
 one third of which will vest on each anniversary

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.



Item
9A. Controls and Procedures.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation
 the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Remediation
of Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A
material weakness is a deficiency
 or combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.

During
the quarter ended September 30
 2019
 the Company&rsquo;s management identified a material weakness in the internal control over
financial reporting as a result of inadequate controls over the preparation and review of our consolidated statements of cash

this material weakness to enhance our controls over the preparation and review of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We

process

used in the calculation. In addition

of the statement of cash flows. We also implemented additional procedures to ensure the proper cash flow implications and presentation
are considered for all new transactions. Based on these measures
 management has concluded that the material weakness described
above has been remediated as of December 31
 2019.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal
control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions;
providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements;
providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization;
and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of company assets that could have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations
internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated
financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Management

Control &ndash; Integrated Framework (2013)
Based on this evaluation
 management concluded that the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31
 2019. Except for remediation of the material weakness discussed above
 there were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31
 2019 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely
to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP has audited our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019; their report is included below.


    
    


Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of New Age Beverages Corporation:

Opinion
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of New Age Beverages Corporation and subsidiaries (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
as of December 31
 2019
 issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion
 the Company maintained
 in all material
respects
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019

Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

We
have also audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
the consolidated financial statements and schedule of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31
 2019
 and our report
dated March 16
 2020
 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis
for Opinion

The
Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
 included in the accompanying Management&rsquo;s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists
 testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk
 and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition
and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A
company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the company&rsquo;s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Anti-Takeover
Provisions

The
Charter Documents and the WBCA contain certain provisions that may discourage an unsolicited takeover of the Company or make an

are applicable to the Company:

Washington
Anti-Takeover Statute

Washington
law imposes restrictions on certain transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders. Chapter 23B.19 of
the WBCA generally prohibits a &ldquo;target corporation&rdquo; from engaging in certain significant business transactions with
an &ldquo;acquiring person
&rdquo; which is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially owns 10% or more of the
voting securities of the target corporation
 for a period of five years after the date the acquiring person first became a 10%
beneficial owner of the voting securities of the target corporation
 unless
 among other options
 the business transaction or
the acquisition of shares is approved by (i) a majority of the members of the target corporation&rsquo;s board of directors prior
to the time the acquiring person first became a 10% beneficial owner of the target corporation&rsquo;s voting securities or (ii)
a majority of the members of the target corporation&rsquo;s board of directors and two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares
of the target corporation at the time of or subsequent to the business transaction. Such prohibited transactions include
 among
other things:



    
    
a
    merger or consolidation with
 disposition of assets to
 or issuance or redemption of stock to or from
 the acquiring person;

    
    
termination
    of 5% or more of the employees of the target corporation employed in the State of Washington as a result of the acquiring
    person&rsquo;s acquisition of 10% or more of the shares; or

    
    
receipt
    by the acquiring person of any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder.


After
the five-year period
 a &ldquo;significant business transaction&rdquo; may occur if it complies with provisions specified in the
statute requiring that a shareholder receive a fair price. A corporation may not &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of this statute. These
provisions may discourage or make more difficult an attempt by a shareholder or other entity to acquire control of the Company.

Authority
of the Board of Directors

Under
the Amended Articles
 the Company&rsquo;s board of directors has the power to issue any or all of the shares of the Company&rsquo;s
capital stock
 including the authority to establish one or more series of Preferred Stock and to fix the powers
 preferences
rights and limitations of such class or series
 without seeking stockholder approval. In addition
 under the Amended Bylaws
 the
Company&rsquo;s board of directors has the right to fill vacancies on the board of directors. Under the Amended Articles
 the
Company&rsquo;s board of directors has the authority to make
 amend and repeal the Bylaws.

 vehicles and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements that expire between January 2020 and March 2039. The Company has made accounting policy elections (i) to not apply the recognition requirements for short-term leases and (ii) for facility leases
 when there are lease and non-lease components
 such as common area maintenance charges


 the Company may elect to terminate the lease. However
 if the lease is terminated before the 20th anniversary of the lease inception date
 then the Company will be obligated to perform certain restoration obligations. The Company determined that the restoration obligation is a significant penalty whereby there is reasonable certainty that the Company will not elect to terminate the lease prior to the 20-year anniversary. Therefore

 which may be increased to $25.0 million subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (the EWB Term Loan) and (ii) a $10.0 million revolving loan facility (the EWB Revolver). At the closing






 commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company is required to make a payment towards the outstanding principal amount of the EWB Term Loan in an amount equal to 35% of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the EWB Credit Facility)
 if the Total Leverage Ratio is less than 1.50 to 1.00


 EWB waived (i) any default for failure to maintain at least $5.0 million of net cash with EWB in the United States or in China during the period from July 25
 2019 to October 9
 2019 and (ii) any default for failing to maintain primary operating accounts with EWB
 and ensuring that the Company's deposit and investment accounts with third party financial institutions located in China contain no more than 40% of the Company's total cash
 cash equivalents and investment balances maintained in China. The second amendment also amended the EWB Credit Facility to (i) extend the time period to establish compliance with the operating account provisions until November 30
 2019
 (ii) to make the covenants no longer applicable to the Company's subsidiaries in China
 and (iii) to decrease the amount of net cash from $5.0 million to $2.0 million that the Company is required to maintain with EWB on and after December 31


 Mr. Vanderveen also received a cash payment of $100
000
 the grant of 125
000 stock options
 one third of which will vest on each anniversary of the grant date
 and the grant of 125

 2019. If the Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda was less than $20.0 million
 the Milestone Dividend was reduced by applying a five-times multiple to the difference between the Adjusted EBITDA target of $20 million and actual Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019. Accordingly
 no Milestone Dividend is payable if actual Adjusted EBITDA is $17.0 million or lower. Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda for the year ended December 31
 2019 was less than $17.0 million and

 assumptions
 and estimates that affect&#13;the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions&#13;on current facts
 historical experience
 and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances
 to&#13;determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company&amp;#8217;s significant&#13;accounting estimates include
 but are not necessarily limited to
 impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets; valuation assumptions&#13;for earnout obligations and assets acquired in business combinations; valuation assumptions for stock options
 warrants and equity&#13;instruments issued for goods or services; estimated useful lives for identifiable intangible assets and property and equipment;&#13;allowances for sales returns
 chargebacks and inventory obsolescence; deferred income taxes and the related valuation allowances;&#13;and the evaluation and measurement of contingencies. To the extent there are material differences between the Company&amp;#8217;s estimates&#13;and the actual results

 the Company considers
 among other factors
 the aging of the accounts receivable
 its historical&#13;write-offs
 the credit worthiness of customers

 using the first-in
 first-out method. The components of inventory cost include raw materials
 labor and&#13;overhead. The determination of net realizable value involves various assumptions related to excess or slow-moving inventories

 expiration dates
 current and future product demand
 production planning
 and market conditions. If&#13;future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management&amp;#8217;s assumptions





 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicates&#13;that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The goodwill impairment test is applied&#13;by performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If
 on the basis of qualitative&#13;factors
 it is considered more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount
 further&#13;testing of goodwill for impairment is not required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s&#13;fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

 whereas assets related&#13;to finance leases are included in property and equipment. ROU assets represent the Company&amp;#8217;s right to use an underlying asset&#13;for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the related obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating&#13;lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over&#13;the lease term. Most of the Company&amp;#8217;s leases do not set forth an implicit interest rate

 the ROU calculations give effect to such options. Lease expense&#13;for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Some of the Company&amp;#8217;s lease agreements contain&#13;lease and non-lease components
 which are generally accounted for separately. However
 for certain leases
 the Company elects to&#13;account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally
 for certain equipment leases

 property
 equipment
 and ROU assets
 which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate&#13;the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists for long-lived assets if the carrying amounts of such&#13;assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. An impairment charge&#13;is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset

 including reimbursement of similar costs incurred by the lenders. Amounts paid to the lenders when a financing&#13;is consummated are a reduction of the proceeds and are treated as a debt discount. Except for revolving lines of credit
 debt issuance&#13;costs and discounts are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the carrying value of the debt&#13;and are accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs related to revolving lines of credit&#13;are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a long-term asset and are amortized using the straight-line method&#13;over the contractual term of the debt agreement. Unamortized deferred debt issuance costs are not charged to expense when the related&#13;debt becomes a demand obligation due to the violation of terms so long as it is probable that the lenders will either waive the&#13;violation or will agree to amend or restructure the terms of the indebtedness. If either circumstance is probable
 the deferred&#13;debt issuance costs continue to be amortized over the remaining term of the initial amortization period. If it is not probable

 legal fees and other costs that&#13;are directly associated with equity offerings are capitalized as deferred offering costs

 promotional and selling expenses&#13;consisted of media advertising costs

 or a liability has been incurred
 and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If some&#13;amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range
 the Company accrues that&#13;amount. Alternatively
 when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount
 the Company&#13;accrues the lowest amount in the range. If the Company determines that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss&#13;is estimable
 then the Company discloses the range of the possible loss. If the Company cannot estimate the range of loss
 it will&#13;disclose the reason why it cannot estimate the range of loss. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to&#13;it to determine whether an accrual is required


 including stock options
 based on the fair market value of&#13;the award as of the grant date. The Company computes the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes-Merton (&amp;#8220;BSM&amp;#8221;)&#13;option pricing model. The Company recognizes the cost of the equity awards over the period that services are provided to earn the&#13;award
 usually the vesting period. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting schedule
 and the only condition for vesting&#13;is a service condition
 compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period&#13;as if the award was
 in substance
 a single award. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures in the period that the forfeiture&#13;occurs

 the Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of any embedded&#13;features are clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the remainder of the host contract. When it&#13;is determined that (i) an embedded feature possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the primary&#13;economic characteristics of the host contract
 and (ii) a separate
 stand-alone instrument with the same terms would meet the definition&#13;of a financial derivative instrument

 Income Taxes
 under which deferred income taxes are recognized&#13;based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities&#13;given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities&#13;from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes
 the Company considers tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company&#13;operates
 estimates of future taxable income
 and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations
 operating results
 or&#13;the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary
 adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities&#13;may be required. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.&#13;The recorded valuation allowance is based on significant estimates and judgments and if the facts and circumstances change
 the&#13;valuation allowance could materially change. In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
 the Company recognizes the financial&#13;statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the&#13;position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold

 while the functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. A majority of Morinda&amp;#8217;s&#13;business operations occur outside the United States. The local currency of each of the Morinda&amp;#8217;s international subsidiaries&#13;and branches is used as its functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates&#13;existing at the consolidated balance sheet date
 and net revenue and expenses are translated at monthly average exchange rates.&#13;The resulting net foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate&#13;component of shareholders&amp;#8217; equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

 the Financial Accounting&#13;Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2017-09
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Compensation&amp;#8212;Stock&#13;Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting&lt;/i&gt;
 which provides clarification on when modification accounting should be used&#13;for changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. This standard does not change the accounting for modifications&#13;of share-based payment awards but clarifies that modification accounting guidance should only be applied if there is a change to&#13;the value
 vesting conditions
 or award classification and would not be required if the changes are considered non-substantive.&#13;This standard was adopted prospectively by the Company effective on January 1

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2017-04
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;ASU&#13;2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and eliminating&#13;the requirement for a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment. Under ASU 2017-04
&#13;goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount whereby an impairment&#13;charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s fair value; however
 the loss&#13;recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition
 income tax effects are&#13;considered
 if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning&#13;after December 15
 2019. Effective October 1
 2019
 the Company early adopted this new guidance prospectively for its annual goodwill&#13;impairment testing which resulted in impairment expense of $44.9 million that is included in the accompanying consolidated statement&#13;of operations for the year ended December 31

An entity should apply the requirements&#13;of ASC 718 to non-employee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost.&#13;The Company adopted this new guidance using the modified retrospective method effective on January 1
 2019. On the date of adoption
&#13;there were no outstanding awards granted to non-employees for which the measurement date had not yet occurred. Therefore

 which is intended to simplify various&#13;aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and&#13;clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years
 and interim&#13;periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim&#13;period. ASU 2019-12 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company early adopted this guidance effective&#13;January 1
 2019

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2016-13
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;ASU&#13;2016-13 amends the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. This update adds an impairment model (known as the current&#13;expected credit losses model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance
 an entity recognizes
&#13;as an allowance
 its estimate of expected credit losses. In November 2018
 ASU 2016-13 was amended by ASU 2018-19
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Codification&#13;Improvements to Topic 326
 Financial Instruments &amp;#8211; Credit Losses.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;ASU 2018-19 clarifies that operating lease receivables&#13;are not within the scope of ASC 326-20 and should instead be accounted for under the new leasing standard
 ASC 842. ASU 2016-13&#13;and ASU 2018-19 are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The Company does not expect the adoption&#13;of ASU 2016-13 and ASU 2018-19 will have a material impact on its results of operations

 &lt;i&gt;Business Combinations&lt;/i&gt;
 and using the fair value concepts set forth in ASC 820


 2019
 the Company and BWR Acquisition&#13;Corp.
 a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&amp;#8220;BWR Merger Sub&amp;#8221;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the&#13;&amp;#8220;Merger Agreement&amp;#8221;) with Brands Within Reach
 LLC (&amp;#8220;BWR&amp;#8221;)
 and Olivier Sonnois
 the sole owner of BWR (&amp;#8220;Mr.&#13;Sonnois&amp;#8221;). At the closing on July 10
 2019 (the &amp;#8220;BWR Closing Date&amp;#8221;)
 the transactions contemplated by the Merger&#13;Agreement were completed resulting in the merger of BWR Merger Sub with and into BWR
 and BWR became a wholly-owned subsidiary&#13;of the Company (the &amp;#8220;BWR Merger&amp;#8221;). This closing of the transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of&#13;accounting based on ASC 805
 &lt;i&gt;Business Combinations&lt;/i&gt;
 and using the fair value concepts set forth in ASC 820

 the&#13;Company made a loan to BWR in the amount of $1.0 million in June 2019. The Merger Agreement provided that if BWR&amp;#8217;s working&#13;capital set forth on its opening balance sheet was negative
 then the number of shares of Common Stock issuable by the Company&#13;would be reduced from 700
000 shares to account for the deficiency. The opening balance sheet resulted in negative working capital&#13;of approximately $2.5 million
 which resulted in a reduction of the number of shares issued at closing to 107
602 shares. Accordingly
&#13;the estimated fair value of the shares was approximately $453


 2018
 the Company entered into&#13;a Plan of Merger (the &amp;#8220;Merger Agreement&amp;#8221;) with Morinda and New Age Health Sciences Holdings
 Inc.
 a wholly owned subsidiary&#13;of the Company (&amp;#8220;Merger Sub&amp;#8221;). On December 21
 2018 (the &amp;#8220;Closing Date&amp;#8221;)

 the Company&#13;paid to Morinda&amp;#8217;s equity holders (i) $75.0 million in cash; (ii) 2
016
480 shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s Common Stock with&#13;an estimated fair value on the Closing Date of approximately $11.0 million
 (iii) 43
804 shares of Series D Preferred Stock (the&#13;&amp;#8220;Preferred Stock&amp;#8221;) providing for the potential payment of up to $15 million contingent upon Morinda achieving certain&#13;post-closing milestones

 the holders of the Preferred Stock were entitled to receive a dividend of&#13;up to an aggregate of $15.0 million (the &amp;#8220;Milestone Dividend&amp;#8221;) if the Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the CoD) of Morinda&#13;was at least $20.0 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. If the Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda was less than $20.0 million
&#13;the Milestone Dividend was reduced by applying a five-times multiple to the difference between the Adjusted EBITDA target of $20&#13;million and actual Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019. Accordingly
 no Milestone Dividend is payable if actual&#13;Adjusted EBITDA is $17.0 million or lower. Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda for the year ended December 31
 2019 was less than $17.0&#13;million and
 accordingly

 the Company was required to pay&#13;a quarterly dividend to the holders of the Preferred Stock at a rate of 1.5% per annum of the Milestone Dividend amount
 payable&#13;on a pro rata basis. The Company may choose to pay the Milestone Dividend and /or the annual dividend in cash or in kind
 provided&#13;that if the Company chooses to pay in kind
 the shares of Common Stock issued as payment therefore must be registered under the&#13;Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &amp;#8220;Securities Act&amp;#8221;). The Preferred Stock terminates on April 15
 2020. The annual&#13;cash dividend is payable on April 15

 Morinda was an S corporation&#13;for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly
 Morinda&amp;#8217;s taxable earnings were reported on the individual income&#13;tax returns of the stockholders who were responsible for payment of the related income tax liabilities. In December 2018
 Morinda&#13;agreed to distribute to its stockholders approximately $39.6 million of its previously-taxed S corporation earnings whereby distributions&#13;are payable (i) up to $25.0 million for which the timing and amount are subject to a future financing event

 acquisition-related transaction&#13;costs (e.g.
 advisory
 legal and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred but are&#13;accounted for as expenses in the periods in which such costs are incurred. In connection with the Merger
 the Company incurred&#13;transaction costs of $3.2 million
 including (i) payment of cash of $1.1 million and issuance of 214
250 shares of Common Stock&#13;with a fair value of $1.2 million to a financial advisor that assisted with the consummation of the Merger

 which resulted in the elimination of the liability during 2019. The fair value of the Marley earnout as of December 31
 2018 was valued using the weighted average return on assets for a total of $0.9 million. Changes in fair value of the Marley earnout resulted in a gain of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31
 2019 and an expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31

 2019

 2018
 the fair value of earnout consideration under the Series D Preferred Stock was determined by an independent valuation specialist using an option pricing model. Key inputs in the valuation included forecast annual EBITDA of Morinda
 expected volatility of forecast annual EBITDA of 10.0%
 the risk-free interest rate of 2.6%
 a discount rate applicable to forecast annual EBITDA of 21.5%
 a risk premium of 18.9%
 and an estimated credit spread of 5.7%. As of December 31
 2019
 it was determined that Morinda&amp;#8217;s EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019 was less than $17.0 million and therefore no Milestone Dividend was payable. Accordingly

 Morinda agreed to pay its former stockholders up to $25.0 million from the net proceeds of the sale leaseback discussed in Note 7. Since this amount was only payable from the proceeds of a long-term financing
 the net carrying value was classified in long-term liabilities as of December 31

 the calculations of pro forma net revenue and pro forma&#13;net loss give effect to the pre-acquisition operating results of Morinda and BWR based on (i) the historical net revenue and net&#13;income (loss)
 (ii) incremental depreciation and amortization based on the fair value of property
 equipment and identifiable&#13;intangible assets acquired and the related estimated useful lives

 the Company invested&#13;in several business combinations to accelerate its core business strategy of developing
 marketing
 selling
 and distributing healthy&#13;liquid dietary supplements and ready-to-drink beverages. The carrying value of the NewAge segment included several reporting units&#13;with goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with an aggregate net carrying value of $45.9 million as of December 31

 the Company&#13;performed its annual goodwill impairment testing in conjunction with its annual budget process to reassess strategic priorities&#13;and forecast future operating performance and capital spending. Accordingly
 the Company performed a quantitative assessment of&#13;the fair value of each of its reporting units in the NewAge and Noni by NewAge segments as of December 31
 2019. Fair value of&#13;the reporting units was determined using the fair value concepts set forth in ASC 820
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Fair Value Measurement&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;based&#13;on the report of an independent valuation specialist. The valuation approach attributable to each reporting unit used a weighted&#13;average from the &amp;#8220;income approach&amp;#8221; based on the present value of the future after-tax cash flows

 the&#13;Company determined that an aggregate impairment charge of $44.9 million was required to eliminate the net carrying value of all&#13;goodwill and substantially all identifiable intangible assets for all reporting units in the NewAge segment. For the year ended&#13;December 31

 2019
 the Company extended a&#13;license agreement with Marley Merchandising LLC through March 31
 2030. As consideration for the extension
 the Company issued&#13;a warrant that was immediately exercisable for 200
000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $5.14 per share. This warrant&#13;is exercisable for ten years and had a grant date fair value of $0.8 million
 which is included in other license agreements in&#13;the identifiable intangible assets table above. This intangible asset is being amortized over the remaining term of the Marley&#13;license. The fair value of the warrant was determined using the BSM option-pricing model. Key assumptions included an expected&#13;term of five years
 volatility of 116%


 vehicles and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements that expire between January 2020 and March&#13;2039. The Company has made accounting policy elections (i) to not apply the recognition requirements for short-term leases and&#13;(ii) for facility leases
 when there are lease and non-lease components
 such as common area maintenance charges
 to account for&#13;the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had&#13;operating lease expense of $10.6 million and $1.6 million

 2019
 the Company entered into&#13;an agreement with a major Japanese real estate company resulting in the sale for approximately $57.1 million of the land and building&#13;in Tokyo that serves as the corporate headquarters of Morinda&amp;#8217;s Japanese subsidiary. Concurrently with the sale
 the Company&#13;entered into a lease of this property for a term of 27 years with the option to terminate the lease any time after seven years.&#13;The monthly lease cost is &amp;#165;20.0 million (approximately $184
000 based on the exchange rate as of December 31
 2019) for the&#13;initial seven-year period of the lease term. After the seventh year of the lease term
 either party may elect to adjust the monthly&#13;lease payment to the then current market rate for similar buildings in Tokyo. In order to secure its obligations under the lease
&#13;the Company provided a refundable security deposit of approximately $1.8 million. At any time after the seventh year of the lease&#13;term
 the Company may elect to terminate the lease. However
 if the lease is terminated before the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary&#13;of the lease inception date
 then the Company will be obligated to perform certain restoration obligations. The Company determined&#13;that the restoration obligation is a significant penalty whereby there is reasonable certainty that the Company will not elect&#13;to terminate the lease prior to the 20-year anniversary. Therefore

 the $2.6&#13;million mortgage on the building was repaid at closing and the related interest rate swap agreement discussed in Note 8 was cancelled
&#13;the refundable security deposit of $1.8 million was paid at closing
 and the Company became obligated to pay $25.0 million to the&#13;former stockholders of Morinda to settle the full amount of the contingent financing liability discussed in Note 4. Other cash&#13;payments that have been or will be made include transaction costs of $1.9 million
 post-closing repair obligations of $1.7 million









 and is included in gain from sale of property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations&#13;for the year ended December 31

 the operating lease payments&#13;are allocated to (i) reduce the operating lease liability
 (ii) reduce the principal portion of the deferred lease financing obligation
&#13;and (iii) to recognize imputed interest expense at an incremental borrowing rate of 3.5% on the deferred lease financing obligation&#13;over the 20-year lease term. The present value of the future lease payments amounted to a gross operating lease liability of $25.0&#13;million. After deducting the $17.6 million deferred lease financing obligations

 the Company began attempting&#13;to sublease a portion of its ROU assets previously used for warehouse space that are no longer needed for current operations. As&#13;a result
 an impairment evaluation was completed that resulted in recognition of an impairment charge of $1.5 million in June 2019.&#13;This evaluation was based on the expected time to obtain a suitable subtenant and current market rates for similar commercial properties.&#13;As of December 31
 2019
 the Company was continuing its efforts to obtain a subtenant for this space. An updated impairment evaluation&#13;was performed
 which resulted in an additional impairment charge of $0.8 million for total impairment of $2.3 million for the year&#13;ended December 31

 2019 and 2018

 2019 and 2018
 the weighted&#13;average remaining lease term under operating leases was 12.5 and 5.9 years
 respectively. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the&#13;weighted average discount rate for ROU operating lease liabilities was 5.6% and 6.6%

 the scheduled future&#13;maturities of long-term debt
 exclusive of discount accretion







 2019
 the Company entered into&#13;a Loan and Security Agreement (the &amp;#8220;EWB Credit Facility&amp;#8221;) with East West Bank (&amp;#8220;EWB&amp;#8221;). The EWB Credit Facility&#13;matures on March 29
 2023 and provides for (i) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million
 which may be increased&#13;to $25.0 million subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (the &amp;#8220;EWB Term Loan&amp;#8221;) and (ii) a $10.0 million revolving&#13;loan facility (the &amp;#8220;EWB Revolver&amp;#8221;). At the closing

 the EWB Credit&#13;Facility provides for interest at a rate that is 3.0% above the rate otherwise applicable to such obligations. As of December 31
&#13;2019
 the Company was not in compliance with the minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant related to the EWB Credit Facility. As discussed&#13;in Note 16
 on March 13

 if the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the EWB Credit Facility)&#13;is equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00
 borrowings will bear interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.50%. As of December 31
 2019
&#13;the prime rate was 4.75% and the contractual rate applicable to outstanding borrowings under the EWB Credit Facility was 5.75%.&#13;As discussed below
 the Company has also entered into a swap agreement that provides for a total notional amount of $10.0 million&#13;at a fixed interest rate of approximately 5.4% through May 1

 the Company would be required to pay an early termination fee in&#13;the amount of 0.50% of the revolving line. Additional borrowing requests under the EWB Revolver are subject to various customary&#13;conditions precedent
 including satisfaction of a borrowing base test as more fully described in the EWB Credit Facility. The EWB&#13;Revolver also provides for an unused line fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the undrawn portion. The EWB Revolver includes a subjective&#13;acceleration clause and a lockbox arrangement where the Company is required to direct its customers to remit payments to a restricted&#13;bank account
 whereby all available funds are used to pay down the outstanding principal balance under the EWB Revolver. Accordingly
&#13;the entire outstanding principal balance of the EWB Revolver is classified as a current liability as of December 31
 2019. On January&#13;2
 2020
 the Company elected to make a voluntary prepayment of $9.7 million to repay all outstanding borrowings under the EWB Revolver.&#13;Subject to the terms of the EWB Credit Facility

 2019
 followed by monthly principal payments of $125
000 plus interest through the stated maturity date of&#13;the EWB Term Loan. The Company may elect to prepay the EWB Term Loan before the stated maturity date on 10 business days&amp;#8217;&#13;notice to EWB subject to a prepayment fee of 2% for the first year of the Term Loan and 1% for the second year of the Term Loan.&#13;No later than 120 days after the end of each fiscal year
 commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company&#13;is required to make a payment towards the outstanding principal amount of the EWB Term Loan in an amount equal to 35% of the Excess&#13;Cash Flow (as defined in the EWB Credit Facility)
 if the Total Leverage Ratio is less than 1.50 to 1.00
 or 50% of the Excess&#13;Cash Flow if the Total Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00. The Company did not generate Excess Cash Flow for&#13;the year ended December 31
 2019 and
 accordingly

 2019
 the Company entered into&#13;the first amendment to the EWB Credit Facility effective as of July 11
 2019
 pursuant to which EWB waived any non-compliance by&#13;the Company with certain covenants in the EWB Credit Facility that may have occurred or would otherwise arise as a result of the&#13;BWR Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the first amendment
 BWR entered into a Supplement to Guarantee and Pledge and an Intellectual&#13;Property Security Agreement. On October 9
 2019
 the Company entered into a second amendment to the EWB Credit Facility. Under&#13;the second amendment
 EWB waived (i) any default for failure to maintain at least $5.0 million of net cash with EWB in the United&#13;States or in China during the period from July 25
 2019 to October 9
 2019 and (ii) any default for failing to maintain primary&#13;operating accounts with EWB
 and ensuring that the Company&amp;#8217;s deposit and investment accounts with third party financial institutions&#13;located in China contain no more than 40% of the Company&amp;#8217;s total cash
 cash equivalents and investment balances maintained&#13;in China. The second amendment also amended the EWB Credit Facility to (i) extend the time period to establish compliance with&#13;the operating account provisions until November 30
 2019
 (ii) to make the covenants no longer applicable to the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;subsidiaries in China
 and (iii) to decrease the amount of net cash from $5.0 million to $2.0 million that the Company is required&#13;to maintain with EWB on and after December 31

 2018
 the Company entered into&#13;a loan and security agreement with Siena Lending Group LLC (&amp;#8220;Siena&amp;#8221;) that provided for a $12.0 million revolving credit&#13;facility (the &amp;#8220;Siena Revolver&amp;#8221;) with a scheduled maturity date of August 10
 2021. Outstanding borrowings provided&#13;for interest at the greater of (i) 7.5% or (ii) the prime rate plus 2.75%. As of December 31
 2018
 the effective interest rate&#13;was 8.25%. Beginning on November 7
 2018
 the Company was required to pay interest on a minimum of $2.0 million of borrowings

 2019
 and the unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.5 million were written off as additional interest expense for&#13;the year ended December 31
 2019. Additionally
 the Company incurred a make-whole premium payment of $0.5 million that was also&#13;charged to interest expense for the year ended December 31

 and (ii) default interest at a 5.0% premium if events of default existed. An early termination&#13;premium was required to be paid if Siena&amp;#8217;s commitment to make revolving loans was terminated prior to the stated maturity&#13;date. The fee was equal to 4.00% of the $12.0 million commitment if termination occurred during the first year after the closing&#13;date. These embedded derivatives were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value was estimated using the&#13;&amp;#8220;with&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;without&amp;#8221; method. Accordingly
 the Siena Revolver was first valued with the embedded derivatives&#13;(the &amp;#8220;with&amp;#8221; scenario) and subsequently valued without the embedded derivatives (the &amp;#8220;without&amp;#8221; scenario).&#13;The fair value of the embedded derivatives was estimated as the difference between these two scenarios. The fair values were determined&#13;using the income approach
 specifically the yield method. As of December 31
 2018
 key Level 3 assumptions and estimates used in&#13;the valuation of the embedded derivatives included an assessment of the probability of early termination of the Siena Revolver
&#13;the remaining term to maturity of approximately 2.6 years
 probability of default of approximately 10%

 2018
 the embedded derivatives&#13;for the Siena Revolver had an aggregate fair value of approximately $0.5 million
 which is included in accrued liabilities as of&#13;December 31
 2018. The Company recognized a loss on change in fair value of embedded derivatives of $0.5 million which is included&#13;in non-operating expenses for the year ended December 31
 2018. As a result of the termination of the Siena Revolver as discussed&#13;above
 a make-whole premium of $0.5 million was incurred on March 29
 2019
 and the Company recognized a gain on change in fair&#13;value of embedded derivatives of $0.5 million which is included in non-operating income (expenses) for the year ended December&#13;31

 2019. This swap agreement provides for a total notional amount of $10.0 million at a fixed interest&#13;rate of approximately 5.4% through May 1
 2023
 in exchange for a floating rate indexed to the prime rate plus 0.5%. As of December&#13;31
 2019

 2018
 the Company had one&#13;contract for an interest rate swap with a total notional amount of approximately $2.6 million. At December 31
 2018
 the Company&#13;had an unrealized loss from this interest rate swap agreement of approximately $36
000 that is included in other long-term liabilities&#13;in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As discussed in Note 7

 2018
 the Company issued a senior&#13;secured convertible promissory note (the &amp;#8220;Convertible Note&amp;#8221;) with a principal balance of $4.75 million and a maturity&#13;date of June 20
 2019. The Convertible Note provided for monthly payments of interest only at 8.0% per annum
 and was collateralized&#13;by certain equipment
 general intangibles
 inventory
 and a security interest in all of the Company&amp;#8217;s trademarks

 the Company received net proceeds from the Convertible Note of $4.6 million. The Company also issued to the lender&#13;an aggregate of 226
190 shares of Common Stock with a fair value of approximately $0.4 million. These amounts were accounted for&#13;as an aggregate discount of $0.6 million that was accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method. On August&#13;24
 2018
 the Company repaid the Convertible Note by paying an aggregate of approximately $5.0 million
 which consisted of the&#13;principal balance of $4.75 million plus a make-whole penalty for early prepayment of $0.2 million. Due to the early extinguishment&#13;of the Convertible Note
 the Company recognized accretion for all of the debt discount and issuance costs of $0.6 million for&#13;the year ended December 31


 the Company&amp;#8217;s stockholders&#13;approved an amendment to the Company&amp;#8217;s Articles of Incorporation increasing the authorized shares of Common Stock from 50&#13;million shares to 100 million shares. In May 2019

 not eligible for dividends and ranked equal to Common Stock and below Series A Preferred in&#13;liquidation. Each share of Series B Preferred was convertible into eight shares of Common Stock. The Company issued 284
807 shares&#13;of Series B Preferred through December 31
 2016
 and the holders converted 115
573 shares of Series B Preferred into 924
584 shares&#13;of Common Stock in 2017. The remaining 169
234 shares of Series B Preferred were converted into 1
353
872 shares of Common Stock&#13;during the year ended December 31
 2018. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 an aggregate of 300

 the Board of Directors designated 7
000 shares as Series C Preferred Stock (&amp;#8220;Series C Preferred&amp;#8221;).&#13;In September 2018
 the Company entered into an agreement with two members of the Board of Directors whereby the directors exchanged&#13;an aggregate of 6
900
000 shares of Common Stock owned by them for an aggregate of 6
900 shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s Series C&#13;Preferred. The Certificate of Designation for the Series C Preferred provided for the automatic conversion into 1
000 shares of&#13;the Company&amp;#8217;s Common Stock when the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized&#13;number of shares of Common Stock to 100 million shares. Holders of the Series C Preferred were entitled to receive dividends declared&#13;to holders of Common Stock on an as converted basis. In addition
 each holder of outstanding Series C Preferred was entitled to&#13;vote and had liquidation rights on an as converted basis with the Company&amp;#8217;s Common Stock. Upon stockholder approval to increase&#13;the authorized number of shares of Common Stock to 100 million shares in October 2018
 all 6
900 shares of Series C Preferred converted&#13;to 6
900
000 shares of Common Stock. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018

 the Board of Directors designated 44
000 shares as Series D Preferred Stock and 43
804 shares were issued&#13;in connection with the Morinda business combination in December 2018. As discussed in Note 4
 the Series D Preferred provides for&#13;dividends at 1.5% per annum plus the potential payment of up to $15.0 million contingent upon Morinda achieving certain post-closing&#13;milestones. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Series D Preferred is classified as a liability since it provides for the issuance&#13;of a variable number of shares of Common Stock if the Company elects to settle in shares rather than pay the cash redemption value.&#13;Please refer to Note 4 for additional information on the consideration issued in the Morinda business combination and the valuation&#13;of the Series D Preferred. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the carrying value of the Series D Preferred amounted to $0.2 million&#13;and $13.1 million

 2019
 the Company entered into&#13;an At the Market Offering Agreement (&amp;#8220;ATM Offering Agreement&amp;#8221;) with Roth Capital Partners
 LLC (the &amp;#8220;Agent&amp;#8221;)
&#13;pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $100 million in shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;Common Stock (the &amp;#8220;Placement Shares&amp;#8221;) through the Agent. The Agent is acting as sales agent and is required to use&#13;commercially reasonable efforts to sell on the Company&amp;#8217;s behalf all of the Placement Shares requested to be sold by the Company

 and that are included in long-term assets&#13;in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 the valuation allowance increased by $37.8&#13;million
 primarily due to incremental net operating losses that were not considered realizable. For the year ended December 31
&#13;2018
 the net decrease in the valuation allowance of $2.2 million since net operating loss carryforwards were considered realizable&#13;due to net deferred tax liabilities related to purchase accounting for the Morinda business combination. In assessing the realizability&#13;of deferred income tax assets

 2019
 the Company had unused&#13;net operating loss (&amp;#8220;NOL&amp;#8221;) carryovers for income tax purposes of approximately $62.4 million with approximately $26.3&#13;million relating to foreign subsidiaries and approximately $36.1 million relating to U.S. entities. The federal and state NOL carryforwards&#13;in the income tax returns filed included unrecognized tax benefits. The deferred tax assets recognized for those NOLs are presented&#13;net of these unrecognized tax benefits. The NOLs will expire at various dates from 2020 through 2039
 with the exception of those&#13;in some foreign jurisdictions where there is no expiration. The U.S. NOLs have a full valuation allowance recorded against them.&#13;Of the $26.3 million foreign NOLs
 all but $2.3 million have a valuation allowance recorded against them. Federal and state laws&#13;impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for&#13;income tax purposes
 as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Under the provisions of Section 382 and 383 of the Code
 a change in&#13;control
 as defined by the Code
 may impose an annual limitation on the amount of the Company&amp;#8217;s net operating loss and tax&#13;credit carryforwards

 associated with the realizability of its deferred tax assets
 in particular
&#13;uncertainties related to the future generation of taxable income
 the recent negative trends in certain operating markets
 and&#13;the cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions
 the Company determined that it was not &amp;#8220;more likely than not&amp;#8221; that&#13;it would be able to realize the tax benefits associated with certain of its net deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation

 2019 and 2018
 the total&#13;outstanding balance for liabilities related to unrecognized income tax benefits was $1.5 million and $0.4 million
 respectively.&#13;Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 million
 if recognized
 would affect the effective tax rate. Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.7&#13;million
 if recognized
 would not affect the Company&amp;#8217;s effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred&#13;tax asset that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties&#13;associated with unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax expense. The unrecognized tax benefit as of December 31
 2019&#13;includes an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million for interest and penalties

 and an additional $2.0 million of shares if NABD&amp;#8217;s gross profit is $35.0 million or more for the first 36 consecutive&#13;months of the agreement. All shares issued for the special performance incentives will vest immediately upon achievement of the&#13;performance targets. If the Company elects not to terminate or not renew the ICA

 the Noni by&#13;NewAge segment employees of the Japanese branch are generally entitled to retirement benefits determined by reference to basic&#13;rates of pay at the time of termination
 years of service
 and conditions under which the termination occurs. If the termination&#13;is involuntary or caused by retirement at the mandatory retirement age of 65
 the employee is entitled to a greater payment than&#13;in the case of voluntary termination. Noni by NewAge segment employees in Indonesia whose service is terminated are generally entitled&#13;to retirement benefits determined by reference to basic rates of pay at the time of termination
 years of service and conditions&#13;under which the termination occurs. The unfunded benefit obligation for these defined benefit pension plans was approximately $3.5&#13;million and $3.0 million as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. Of these amounts
 approximately $3.4 million and $2.9&#13;million are included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31

 the commissions paid to&#13;the Company&amp;#8217;s IPCs
 labeling and packaging of products
 conducting business as a direct-selling business
 and other facets&#13;of manufacturing and selling products. In some instances
 the rules and regulations may not be fully defined under the law or are&#13;otherwise unclear in their application. Additionally
 laws and regulations can change from time to time
 as can their interpretation&#13;by the courts
 administrative bodies
 and the tax and customs authorities in each country. The Company actively seeks to be in&#13;compliance
 in all material respects
 with the laws of each of the countries in which it does business and expects its IPCs to&#13;do the same. The Company&amp;#8217;s operations are often subject to review by local country tax and customs authorities and inquiries&#13;from other governmental agencies. No assurance can be given that the Company&amp;#8217;s compliance with governmental rules and regulations&#13;will not be challenged by the authorities or that such challenges will not result in assessments or required changes in the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;business that could have a material impact on its business

 2019 and 2018
 the Company has recorded a current liability under ASC 450
 &lt;i&gt;Contingencies&lt;/i&gt;
 of approximately $0.9 million&#13;and $0.8 million

 the Company may be a party&#13;to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims&#13;cannot be predicted with certainty
 the Company currently believes that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will&#13;not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the outcome
 litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company&#13;because of defense and settlement costs
 diversion of management resources

 and collateral to credit card companies for guarantee of IPC payments. Approximately $0.8 million&#13;of guarantee deposits are included in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31

 the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it transacts&#13;and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the following&#13;fair value hierarchy

 2019
&#13;approximately 72% of the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated net revenue was generated outside the United States
 primarily in the Asia&#13;Pacific market. Most of the Noni by NewAge&amp;#8217;s products have a component of the Noni plant
 Morinda Citrifolia (&amp;#8220;Noni&amp;#8221;)&#13;as a common element. Tahitian Noni&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#160;Juice
 MAX and other noni-based beverage products are expected to comprise&#13;over 80% of net revenue of the Noni by NewAge segment for the foreseeable future. However
 if consumer demand for these products&#13;decreases significantly or if the Company ceases to offer these products without a suitable replacement
 the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated&#13;financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. The Company purchases fruit and other Noni-based raw materials&#13;from French Polynesia
 but these purchases of materials are from a wide variety of individual suppliers with no single supplier&#13;accounting for more than 10% of its raw material purchases during 2019. However
 as the majority of the raw materials are consolidated&#13;and processed at the Company&amp;#8217;s plant in Tahiti
 the Company could be negatively affected by certain governmental actions&#13;or natural disasters if they occurred in that region of the world. For the year ended December 31

 a novel strain of coronavirus&#13;was reported to have surfaced in China. The spread of this virus began to cause some business disruption through reduced net revenue&#13;in the Company&amp;#8217;s Asia Pacific market in January and February 2020. While the disruption is currently expected to be temporary
&#13;there is considerable uncertainty around the duration. Therefore
 while the Company expects this matter to negatively impact its&#13;operating results. However

 the Financial Accounting&#13;Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2017-09
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Compensation&amp;#8212;Stock&#13;Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting&lt;/i&gt;
 which provides clarification on when modification accounting should be used&#13;for changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. This standard does not change the accounting for modifications&#13;of share-based payment awards but clarifies that modification accounting guidance should only be applied if there is a change to&#13;the value
 vesting conditions
 or award classification and would not be required if the changes are considered non-substantive.&#13;This standard was adopted prospectively by the Company effective on January 1

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2017-04
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;ASU&#13;2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and eliminating&#13;the requirement for a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment. Under ASU 2017-04
&#13;goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount whereby an impairment&#13;charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s fair value; however
 the loss&#13;recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition
 income tax effects are&#13;considered
 if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning&#13;after December 15
 2019. Effective October 1
 2019
 the Company early adopted this new guidance prospectively for its annual goodwill&#13;impairment testing which resulted in impairment expense of $44.9 million that is included in the accompanying consolidated statement&#13;of operations for the year ended December 31

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2018-07
 &lt;i&gt;Compensation &amp;#8212; Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting&lt;/i&gt;
&#13;which expands the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (&amp;#8220;ASC&amp;#8221;) 718
 &lt;i&gt;Compensation&amp;#8212;Stock Compensation&#13;&lt;/i&gt;to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. An entity should apply the&#13;requirements of ASC 718 to non-employee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution&#13;of cost. The Company adopted this new guidance using the modified retrospective method effective on January 1
 2019. On the date&#13;of adoption
 there were no outstanding awards granted to non-employees for which the measurement date had not yet occurred. Therefore

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2019-12&lt;i&gt;
 Income Taxes (Topic 740)
 Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes&lt;/i&gt;
 which is intended to simplify various&#13;aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and&#13;clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years
 and interim&#13;periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim&#13;period. ASU 2019-12 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company early adopted this guidance effective&#13;January 1
 2019

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2016-13
 &lt;i&gt;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.&lt;/i&gt; ASU 2016-13&#13;amends the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. This update adds an impairment model (known as the current expected&#13;credit losses model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance
 an entity recognizes
&#13;as an allowance
 its estimate of expected credit losses. In November 2018
 ASU 2016-13 was amended by ASU 2018-19
 &lt;i&gt;Codification&#13;Improvements to Topic 326
 Financial Instruments &amp;#8211; Credit Losses.&lt;/i&gt; ASU 2018-19 clarifies that operating lease receivables&#13;are not within the scope of ASC 326-20 and should instead be accounted for under the new leasing standard
 ASC 842. ASU 2016-13&#13;and ASU 2018-19 are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The Company does not expect the adoption&#13;of ASU 2016-13 and ASU 2018-19 will have a material impact on its results of operations

 which resulted in the elimination of the liability during 2019. The fair value of the Marley earnout as of December 31
 2018 was valued using the weighted average return on assets for a total of $0.9 million. Changes in fair value of the Marley earnout resulted in a gain of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31
 2019 and an expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31

 2019

 2018
 the fair value of earnout consideration under the Series D Preferred Stock was determined by an independent valuation specialist using an option pricing model. Key inputs in the valuation included forecast annual EBITDA of Morinda
 expected volatility of forecast annual EBITDA of 10.0%
 the risk-free interest rate of 2.6%
 a discount rate applicable to forecast annual EBITDA of 21.5%
 a risk premium of 18.9%
 and an estimated credit spread of 5.7%. As of December 31
 2019
 it was determined that Morinda&amp;#8217;s EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019 was less than $17.0 million and therefore no Milestone Dividend was payable. Accordingly

 Morinda agreed to pay its former stockholders up to $25.0 million from the net proceeds of the sale leaseback discussed in Note 7. Since this amount was only payable from the proceeds of a long-term financing
 the net carrying value was classified in long-term liabilities as of December 31

 2010. On December 21
 2018
 the Company completed a business&#13;combination with Morinda Holdings
 Inc.
 a Utah corporation (&amp;#8220;Morinda&amp;#8221;). The Company is a healthy beverages and lifestyles&#13;company engaged in the development and commercialization of a portfolio of organic
 natural and other better-for-you healthy beverages
&#13;liquid dietary supplements
 cannabidiol (&amp;#8220;CBD&amp;#8221;) topical products
 and other healthy lifestyle products. On July 10
&#13;2019
 the Company completed a business combination with Brands Within Reach
 LLC (&amp;#8220;BWR&amp;#8221;). For further information about&#13;the Morinda and BWR business combinations


 all&#13;of which are wholly-owned. These subsidiaries consist of NABC
 Inc.
 NABC Properties
 LLC (&amp;#8220;NABC Properties&amp;#8221;)
 Morinda&#13;and BWR. NABC
 Inc. is a Colorado-based operating company that consolidates performance and financial results of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;subsidiaries and divisions. NABC Properties administers a building owned by the Company in southern Colorado. BWR is a component&#13;of the NewAge segment and owns key licensing and distribution rights in the United States for some of the world&amp;#8217;s leading&#13;beverage brands. The Company&amp;#8217;s former subsidiary
 New Age Health Sciences
 Inc.
 was merged with and into NABC

 including the U.S.&amp;#160;Food and Drug Administration; Federal Trade Commission;&#13;Consumer Product Safety Commission; federal

The CODM reviews financial information presented for each reportable segment for&#13;purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Upon consummation of the business combination with&#13;Morinda in December 2018
 the Company&amp;#8217;s CODM began assessing performance and allocating resources based on the financial&#13;information of two operating segments
 the Morinda segment and the NewAge segment. In 2020
 the Morinda segment began doing business&#13;as Noni by NewAge. As a result of this change

 2019
 the Company&#13;incurred a net loss of $89.8 million and net cash used in operating activities amounted to $31.8 million. As of December 31
 2019
&#13;the Company had an accumulated deficit of $112.5 million. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had contractual obligations of approximately&#13;$21.6 million that are due during the year ending December 31
 2020. This amount includes (i) payables to the former stockholders&#13;of Morinda of $5.7 million as discussed in Note 4
 (ii) operating lease payments of $8.4 million
 (iii) principal and estimated&#13;interest payments of $2.8 million due under the EWB Credit Facility discussed in Note 8
 (iv) open purchase orders for inventories&#13;of $3.4 million
 and (v) payments under certain employment agreements of $1.3 million. Our contractual obligations discussed above&#13;exclude discretionary principal payments under the EWB Revolver for $9.7 million that were paid on January 2

 the Company entered&#13;into the third amendment and waiver (the &amp;#8220;Third Amendment&amp;#8221;) to the EWB Credit Facility in March 2020. The Third Amendment&#13;is expected to have a significant impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s liquidity and capital resources for the year ending December 31
&#13;2020. The Third Amendment requires the Company to maintain an aggregate of $15.1 million in restricted cash balances with EWB.&#13;The Third Amendment also requires equity infusions of $10.0 million for the fiscal quarter ending March 31
 2020 (of which $6.3&#13;million was received in January 2020). Cumulative equity infusions are required for $20.0 million and $30.0 million for the six-&#13;and nine-month periods ending June 30
 2020 and September 30
 2020
 respectively. Management intends to raise the total required&#13;equity infusions of $30.0 million through the ATM Offering Agreement discussed in Note 9. The ATM Offering Agreement is scheduled&#13;to terminate on April 30
 2020

 2019
 the Company had cash&#13;and cash equivalents of $60.8 million and working capital amounted to $33.5 million. Management believes existing cash resources&#13;combined with expected proceeds under the ATM Offering Agreement will be sufficient to fund the restricted cash required by EWB&#13;of $15.1 million
 contractual obligations of $21.6 million
 and working capital requirements through March 2021. There are no&#13;assurances that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing through equity offerings and debt financings in the future.&#13;Even if these financing sources are available

 using the first-in
 first-out method. The components of inventory cost include raw materials
 labor&#13;and overhead. The determination of net realizable value involves various assumptions related to excess or slow-moving inventories

 expiration dates
 current and future product demand
 production planning
 and market conditions. If&#13;future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management&amp;#8217;s assumptions








 or more frequently when events or circumstances&#13;indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The goodwill impairment test&#13;is applied by performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If
 on the basis of&#13;qualitative factors
 it is considered more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying&#13;amount
 further testing of goodwill for impairment is not required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting&#13;unit&amp;#8217;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess


 whereas assets related&#13;to finance leases are included in property and equipment. ROU assets represent the Company&amp;#8217;s right to use an underlying asset&#13;for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the related obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating&#13;lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over&#13;the lease term. Most of the Company&amp;#8217;s leases do not set forth an implicit interest rate

 the ROU calculations give effect to such options. Lease expense&#13;for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Some of the Company&amp;#8217;s lease agreements contain&#13;lease and non-lease components
 which are generally accounted for separately. However
 for certain leases
 the Company elects&#13;to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally
 for certain equipment leases

 which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances&#13;indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists for long-lived assets if the carrying amounts&#13;of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. An impairment&#13;charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset

 including reimbursement of similar costs incurred by the lenders. Amounts paid to the lenders&#13;when a financing is consummated are a reduction of the proceeds and are treated as a debt discount. Except for revolving lines&#13;of credit
 debt issuance costs and discounts are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the&#13;carrying value of the debt and are accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs related&#13;to revolving lines of credit are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a long-term asset and are amortized&#13;using the straight-line method over the contractual term of the debt agreement. Unamortized deferred debt issuance costs are not&#13;charged to expense when the related debt becomes a demand obligation due to the violation of terms so long as it is probable that&#13;the lenders will either waive the violation or will agree to amend or restructure the terms of the indebtedness. If either circumstance&#13;is probable
 the deferred debt issuance costs continue to be amortized over the remaining term of the initial amortization period.&#13;If it is not probable


 legal fees and other costs that&#13;are directly associated with equity offerings are capitalized as deferred offering costs

 or a liability has been incurred
 and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If some&#13;amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range
 the Company accrues that&#13;amount. Alternatively
 when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount
 the Company&#13;accrues the lowest amount in the range. If the Company determines that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss&#13;is estimable
 then the Company discloses the range of the possible loss. If the Company cannot estimate the range of loss
 it will&#13;disclose the reason why it cannot estimate the range of loss. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to&#13;it to determine whether an accrual is required



 including stock options
 based on the fair market value&#13;of the award as of the grant date. The Company computes the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes-Merton (&amp;#8220;BSM&amp;#8221;)&#13;option pricing model. The Company recognizes the cost of the equity awards over the period that services are provided to earn&#13;the award
 usually the vesting period. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting schedule
 and the only condition for&#13;vesting is a service condition
 compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service&#13;period as if the award was
 in substance
 a single award. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures in the period that&#13;the forfeiture occurs


 the Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of any embedded&#13;features are clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the remainder of the host contract. When it&#13;is determined that (i) an embedded feature possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the&#13;primary economic characteristics of the host contract
 and (ii) a separate
 stand-alone instrument with the same terms would meet&#13;the definition of a financial derivative instrument


 Income Taxes
 under which deferred income taxes are recognized&#13;based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities&#13;given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities&#13;from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes
 the Company considers tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company&#13;operates
 estimates of future taxable income
 and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations
 operating results
 or&#13;the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary
 adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities&#13;may be required. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.&#13;The recorded valuation allowance is based on significant estimates and judgments and if the facts and circumstances change
 the&#13;valuation allowance could materially change. In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
 the Company recognizes the financial&#13;statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain&#13;the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold

The local currency of each of the Morinda&amp;#8217;s international&#13;subsidiaries and branches is used as its functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange&#13;rates existing at the consolidated balance sheet date
 and net revenue and expenses are translated at monthly average exchange&#13;rates. The resulting net foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a&#13;separate component of shareholders&amp;#8217; equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

 which resulted in the elimination of the liability during 2019. The fair value of the Marley earnout as of December 31
 2018 was valued using the weighted average return on assets for a total of $0.9 million. Changes in fair value of the Marley earnout resulted in a gain of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31
 2019 and an expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31


 2019


 2018
 the fair value of earnout consideration under the Series D Preferred Stock was determined by an independent valuation specialist using an option pricing model. Key inputs in the valuation included forecast annual EBITDA of Morinda
 expected volatility of forecast annual EBITDA of 10.0%
 the risk-free interest rate of 2.6%
 a discount rate applicable to forecast annual EBITDA of 21.5%
 a risk premium of 18.9%
 and an estimated credit spread of 5.7%. As of December 31
 2019
 it was determined that Morinda&#8217;s EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019 was less than $17.0 million and therefore no Milestone Dividend was payable. Accordingly


 Morinda agreed to pay its former stockholders up to $25.0 million from the net proceeds of the sale leaseback discussed in Note 7. Since this amount was only payable from the proceeds of a long-term financing
 the net carrying value was classified in long-term liabilities as of December 31

      
      


      
      


      
      

 the aggregate intrinsic value of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of stock options amounted to $1.0 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018


 2019 and 2018
 the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was $19
000 and $6.6 million


 2019 and 2018
 the aggregate intrinsic value of vested stock options was $17
000 and $3.1 million


 which requires classification as a liability in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. This liability is adjusted based on the closing price of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock at the end of each reporting period until these awards vest. As of December 31
 2019

      

 2019. All of the shares were forfeited as of December 31

000 shares as Series B Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series B Preferred&#8221;). The
Series B Preferred was non-voting
 not eligible for dividends and ranked equal to Common Stock and below Series A Preferred in
liquidation. Each share of Series B Preferred was convertible into eight shares of Common Stock. The Company issued 284
807 shares
of Series B Preferred through December 31
 2016
 and the holders converted 115
573 shares of Series B Preferred into 924
584 shares
of Common Stock in 2017. The remaining 169
234 shares of Series B Preferred were converted into 1
353
872 shares of Common Stock
during the year ended December 31
 2018. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 an aggregate of 300
000 shares of Series B Preferred
are authorized for future issuance.

Series C Preferred.

 the Board of Directors designated 7
000 shares as Series C Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series C Preferred&#8221;).
In September 2018
 the Company entered into an agreement with two members of the Board of Directors whereby the directors exchanged
an aggregate of 6
900
000 shares of Common Stock owned by them for an aggregate of 6
900 shares of the Company&#8217;s Series C
Preferred. The Certificate of Designation for the Series C Preferred provided for the automatic conversion into 1
000 shares of
the Company&#8217;s Common Stock when the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized
number of shares of Common Stock to 100 million shares. Holders of the Series C Preferred were entitled to receive dividends declared
to holders of Common Stock on an as converted basis. In addition
 each holder of outstanding Series C Preferred was entitled to
vote and had liquidation rights on an as converted basis with the Company&#8217;s Common Stock. Upon stockholder approval to increase
the authorized number of shares of Common Stock to 100 million shares in October 2018
 all 6
900 shares of Series C Preferred converted
to 6
900
000 shares of Common Stock. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 100 shares are designated for future issuance as Series
C Preferred and no shares are outstanding.

Series D Preferred.

 the Board of Directors designated 44
000 shares as Series D Preferred Stock and 43
804 shares were issued
in connection with the Morinda business combination in December 2018. As discussed in Note 4
 the Series D Preferred provides for
dividends at 1.5% per annum plus the potential payment of up to $15.0 million contingent upon Morinda achieving certain post-closing
milestones. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Series D Preferred is classified as a liability since it provides for the issuance
of a variable number of shares of Common Stock if the Company elects to settle in shares rather than pay the cash redemption value.
Please refer to Note 4 for additional information on the consideration issued in the Morinda business combination and the valuation
of the Series D Preferred. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the carrying value of the Series D Preferred amounted to $0.2 million
and $13.1 million
 respectively.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

 2019
 it was determined that Morinda's EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019 was less than $17.0 million and therefore no Milestone Dividend was payable. Accordingly
 the fair value of the Morinda earnout of $0.2 million was solely attributable to the 1.5% dividend set forth in the Series D Preferred Stock.

The aggregate expense charged against earnings to allocate the cost of intangible assets (nonphysical assets not used in production) in a systematic and rational manner to the periods expected to benefit from such assets. As a noncash expense
 this element is added back to net income when calculating cash provided by or used in operations using the indirect method.




























Useful life of finite-lived intangible assets
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.




























Total loss recognized during the period from the impairment of goodwill plus the loss recognized in the period resulting from the impairment of the carrying amount of intangible assets
 other than goodwill.

























































Carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets
 indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Intangible assets are assets
 not including financial assets
 lacking physical substance.

Certain awards granted to employees in China are not permitted to be settled in shares
 which requires classification as a liability in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. This liability is adjusted based on the closing price of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock at the end of each reporting period until these awards vest. As of December 31
 2019
 the cumulative amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the progress toward vesting and the total fair value of the respective awards on that date.

    
    
    

    
    
Represents restricted stock awards that would have vested if Morinda achieved EBITDA of $20.0 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. All of the shares were forfeited as of December 31
 2019 with no compensation recognized.

    
    
    

    
    
The &#8220;Number of Shares&#8221; column reflects shares that vested due to achievement of the service condition during the year. As of December 31
 2019
 the vested shares include approximately 319
000 shares that are not issuable until March 2020. The &#8220;Unvested Compensation&#8221; column reflects the stock-based compensation expense recognized for vested and unvested awards during the year.

    
    
The intrinsic value is based on the closing price of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock of $1.82 per share on December 31
 2019.

 Morinda&#8217;s net earnings taxed for the U.S. and various state jurisdictions were payable personally by the shareholders
pursuant to an election under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). The Subchapter S election terminated
upon closing of Morinda&#8217;s business combination with the Company. Accordingly
 the Company recognized net deferred income
tax liabilities of approximately $10 million for differences between the income tax basis of the assets and liabilities and the
related balances for financial reporting purposes.

of foreign net deferred income tax assets which are expected to be realized in the future
 and that are included in long-term assets
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 the valuation allowance increased by $37.8
million
 primarily due to incremental net operating losses that were not considered realizable. For the year ended December 31
2018
 the net decrease in the valuation allowance of $2.2 million since net operating loss carryforwards were considered realizable
due to net deferred tax liabilities related to purchase accounting for the Morinda business combination. In assessing the realizability
of deferred income tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
income tax assets will not be realized.




 2019
 the Company had unused
net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryovers for income tax purposes of approximately $62.4 million with approximately $26.3
million relating to foreign subsidiaries and approximately $36.1 million relating to U.S. entities. The federal and state NOL carryforwards
in the income tax returns filed included unrecognized tax benefits. The deferred tax assets recognized for those NOLs are presented
net of these unrecognized tax benefits. The NOLs will expire at various dates from 2020 through 2039
 with the exception of those
in some foreign jurisdictions where there is no expiration. The U.S. NOLs have a full valuation allowance recorded against them.
Of the $26.3 million foreign NOLs
 all but $2.3 million have a valuation allowance recorded against them. Federal and state laws
impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for
income tax purposes
 as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Under the provisions of Section 382 and 383 of the Code
 a change in
control
 as defined by the Code
 may impose an annual limitation on the amount of the Company&#8217;s net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards
 and other tax attributes that can be used to reduce future tax liabilities. The Company has performed a preliminary
Section 382 analysis. The preliminary calculations indicate that the Company&#8217;s NOLs do not appear to be subject to the limitation.


and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred
tax assets. When weighing all available evidence
 associated with the realizability of its deferred tax assets
 in particular
uncertainties related to the future generation of taxable income
 the recent negative trends in certain operating markets
 and
the cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions
 the Company determined that it was not &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that
it would be able to realize the tax benefits associated with certain of its net deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation
a valuation allowance against the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions deferred tax assets has been recorded to recognize only
the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company will continue to monitor its historical
and forecast operating results in the U.S. to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets.




 2019 and 2018
 the total
outstanding balance for liabilities related to unrecognized income tax benefits was $1.5 million and $0.4 million
 respectively.
Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 million
 if recognized
 would affect the effective tax rate. Unrecognized tax benefits of $0.7
million
 if recognized
 would not affect the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred
tax asset that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties
associated with unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax expense. The unrecognized tax benefit as of December 31
 2019
includes an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million for interest and penalties
 all of which was recognized for the year ended
December 31
 2019. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes related to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve
months.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]









its business plan
 certain assets may not be recoverable
 certain liabilities may not be paid and investments in its capital stock
may not be recoverable. The Company&#8217;s success depends upon the acceptance of its expertise in creating products and brands
that consumers want to buy
 development of sales and distribution channels
 and its ability to generate significant net revenue
and cash flows from the use of this expertise.


 2019
 the Company
incurred a net loss of $89.8 million and net cash used in operating activities amounted to $31.8 million. As of December 31
 2019
the Company had an accumulated deficit of $112.5 million. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had contractual obligations of approximately
$21.6 million that are due during the year ending December 31
 2020. This amount includes (i) payables to the former stockholders
of Morinda of $5.7 million as discussed in Note 4
 (ii) operating lease payments of $8.4 million
 (iii) principal and estimated
interest payments of $2.8 million due under the EWB Credit Facility discussed in Note 8
 (iv) open purchase orders for inventories
of $3.4 million
 and (v) payments under certain employment agreements of $1.3 million. Our contractual obligations discussed above
exclude discretionary principal payments under the EWB Revolver for $9.7 million that were paid on January 2
 2020 and which can
be reborrowed subject to the terms of the EWB Credit Facility.


 the Company entered
into the third amendment and waiver (the &#8220;Third Amendment&#8221;) to the EWB Credit Facility in March 2020. The Third Amendment
is expected to have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s liquidity and capital resources for the year ending December 31
2020. The Third Amendment requires the Company to maintain an aggregate of $15.1 million in restricted cash balances with EWB.
The Third Amendment also requires equity infusions of $10.0 million for the fiscal quarter ending March 31
 2020 (of which $6.3
million was received in January 2020). Cumulative equity infusions are required for $20.0 million and $30.0 million for the six-
and nine-month periods ending June 30
 2020 and September 30
 2020
 respectively. Management intends to raise the total required
equity infusions of $30.0 million through the ATM Offering Agreement discussed in Note 9. The ATM Offering Agreement is scheduled
to terminate on April 30
 2020
 but management intends to seek an extension. The Company may also undertake other types of equity
offerings to meet the requirements for equity infusions.


 2019
 the Company had cash
and cash equivalents of $60.8 million and working capital amounted to $33.5 million. Management believes existing cash resources
combined with expected proceeds under the ATM Offering Agreement will be sufficient to fund the restricted cash required by EWB
of $15.1 million
 contractual obligations of $21.6 million
 and working capital requirements through March 2021. There are no
assurances that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing through equity offerings and debt financings in the future.
Even if these financing sources are available
 they may be on terms that are not acceptable to the Company&#8217;s board of directors
and stockholders.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

facilities
 vehicles and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements that expire between January 2020 and March
2039. The Company has made accounting policy elections (i) to not apply the recognition requirements for short-term leases and
(ii) for facility leases
 when there are lease and non-lease components
 such as common area maintenance charges
 to account for
the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had
operating lease expense of $10.6 million and $1.6 million
 respectively.




 2019
 the Company entered into
an agreement with a major Japanese real estate company resulting in the sale for approximately $57.1 million of the land and building
in Tokyo that serves as the corporate headquarters of Morinda&#8217;s Japanese subsidiary. Concurrently with the sale
 the Company
entered into a lease of this property for a term of 27 years with the option to terminate the lease any time after seven years.
The monthly lease cost is &#165;20.0 million (approximately $184
000 based on the exchange rate as of December 31
 2019) for the
initial seven-year period of the lease term. After the seventh year of the lease term
 either party may elect to adjust the monthly
lease payment to the then current market rate for similar buildings in Tokyo. In order to secure its obligations under the lease
the Company provided a refundable security deposit of approximately $1.8 million. At any time after the seventh year of the lease
term
 the Company may elect to terminate the lease. However
 anniversary
of the lease inception date
 then the Company will be obligated to perform certain restoration obligations. The Company determined
that the restoration obligation is a significant penalty whereby there is reasonable certainty that the Company will not elect
to terminate the lease prior to the 20-year anniversary. Therefore
 the lease term was determined to be 20 years.


 the $2.6
million mortgage on the building was repaid at closing and the related interest rate swap agreement discussed in Note 8 was cancelled
the refundable security deposit of $1.8 million was paid at closing
 and the Company became obligated to pay $25.0 million to the
former stockholders of Morinda to settle the full amount of the contingent financing liability discussed in Note 4. Other cash
payments that have been or will be made include transaction costs of $1.9 million
 post-closing repair obligations of $1.7 million
and Japanese income taxes of $11.9 million.

the $24.1 million gain on the sale of this property was the result of above-market rent inherent in the leaseback arrangement.
The remainder of the gain of $6.4 million was attributable to the highly competitive process among the entities that bid to purchase
the property
 and is included in gain from sale of property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations
for the year ended December 31
 2019.


to above-market rent is being accounted for as a deferred lease financing obligation. Accordingly
 the operating lease payments
are allocated to (i) reduce the operating lease liability
 (ii) reduce the principal portion of the deferred lease financing obligation
and (iii) to recognize imputed interest expense at an incremental borrowing rate of 3.5% on the deferred lease financing obligation
over the 20-year lease term. The present value of the future lease payments amounted to a gross operating lease liability of $25.0
million. After deducting the $17.6 million deferred lease financing obligations
 the Company recognized an initial ROU asset and
operating lease liability of approximately $7.4 million.




 the Company began attempting
to sublease a portion of its ROU assets previously used for warehouse space that are no longer needed for current operations. As
a result
 an impairment evaluation was completed that resulted in recognition of an impairment charge of $1.5 million in June 2019.
This evaluation was based on the expected time to obtain a suitable subtenant and current market rates for similar commercial properties.
As of December 31
 2019
 the Company was continuing its efforts to obtain a subtenant for this space. An updated impairment evaluation
was performed
 which resulted in an additional impairment charge of $0.8 million for total impairment of $2.3 million for the year
ended December 31
 2019.




 2019 and 2018
 the carrying
