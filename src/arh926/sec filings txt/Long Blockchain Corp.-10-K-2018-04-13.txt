PART
I

ITEM
1. BUSINESS




We
are a holding company. Until December 2017
 we were focused exclusively on the ready-to-drink segment of the beverage industry.
In December 2017
 we announced that we were expanding our attention to include the exploration of
 and investment in
 opportunities
that leverage the benefits of Blockchain technology. We changed our name from &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rdquo;
to &ldquo;Long Blockchain Corp.&rdquo; and reserved the web domain www.longblockchain.com. We also changed our trading symbol
from &ldquo;LTEA&rdquo; to &ldquo;LBCC&rdquo; in connection with the name change.

Blockchain
Business Overview

We
are seeking to become a full service Blockchain technology company. The Blockchain is built by a chronological addition of
transactions
 which are grouped into blocks. Each new block requires a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed
and added to the Blockchain. Our aim is to provide products and services to contribute and generate revenues from all aspects
of the Blockchain eco-system
 including digital trading (such as operating an exchange)
 facilitation of digital currency storage
(Crypto wallets)
 capital raising activities (such as initial coin offerings
 or &ldquo;ICO&rsquo;s&rdquo;) or Distributed Ledger
Technology (&ldquo;DLT&rdquo;)-based initiatives (Smart KYC). As a public company
 we believe that we are in a prime position
to build and acquire technology with global applications using Blockchain technology.

As
our first step to becoming a full service Blockchain technology company
 in March 2018 we entered into a sale and purchase
agreement (the &ldquo;Hashcove Agreement&rdquo;)
 as amended on March 16
 2018
 with the shareholders (&ldquo;Hashcove Shareholders&rdquo;)
of Hashcove Limited (&ldquo;Hashcove&rdquo;). Pursuant to the Hashcove Agreement
 we will acquire all of the outstanding
shares of Hashcove from the Hashcove Shareholders and Hashcove will become our wholly owned subsidiary. The closing of
the transaction
 which is expected to occur by the third quarter of 2018
 is subject to customary closing conditions
including
 among others
 that neither we nor Hashcove suffers a material adverse effect as described in the agreement.

Hashcove
is an early stage UK-based technology company focused on developing and deploying globally scalable distributed ledger technology
solutions. Among its planned product offerings
 Hashcove is developing tokenized platforms
 crypto-exchanges and wallets
 smart
contracts for ICOs
 know-your-customer (&ldquo;KYC&rdquo;) and financial clearing technology on Blockchain
 and other related
Blockchain applications. Hashcove&rsquo;s product team is comprised of 25 employees
 including developers
 with proven
experience in enterprise financial trading algorithmic software.



    
    



Hashcove
would provide us with in-house expertise in a number of Blockchain products and strategic leadership as to Blockchain/DLT
product development and delivery. We believe moving in this direction will enable us to generate maximum revenue while
maintaining full control over the intellectual property related to such technologies. Assuming consummation of the
transaction with Hashcove
 we intend to seek to build decentralized Blockchain applications for clients around the globe
across industries
 for uses as varied as peer-to-peer lending
 healthcare and education. The opportunities could
include developing Blockchain applications on various Blockchain platforms including Ethereum and EOS. We would also look to
leverage the core capability of Hashcove to build its other planned products including Crypto wallet
 Crypto exchange
 ICO
Smart contracts and KYC / Clearing on Blockchain.

Following
our acquisition of Hashcove
 we intend to look to expand our business to allow for the generation of end-client acquisitions
and formulate a solid distribution model. This will be driven by our recent minority investments in Stater Blockchain Limited
(&ldquo;SBL&rdquo;) and TSLC PTE Ltd. (&ldquo;TSLC&rdquo;). SBL focuses on developing and deploying globally scalable blockchain
technology solutions in the financial markets. SBL&rsquo;s wholly-owned subsidiary
 Stater Global Markets (&ldquo;SGM&rdquo;)
is a Financial Conduct Authority (&ldquo;FCA&rdquo;) regulated brokerage that facilitates market access across multiple instruments
including spot FX
 exchange traded futures and contracts for difference (&ldquo;CFDs&rdquo;). TSLC is a major stakeholder
of CASHe
 a leading provider of digital money and short-term financial products to young millennials across India. TSLC owns all
of the intellectual property developed by CASHe and has the worldwide rights outside of India to the application of its intellectual
property for its lending and money transfer platform. We will seek to leverage our investment in SBL to help Hashcove cross market
and diversify its products and offerings
 and will seek to leverage our investment in TSLC to diversify our distribution
base for Blockchain-based products. SBL and TSLC offer us entry ways to very different segments of the financial services market
but that still have a need for Blockchain-based products. We believe this will allow Hashcove&rsquo;s technology to service the
full spectrum of customer segments and hopefully lead to additional avenues for its products.


Beverage
Business Overview

Our
wholly-owned subsidiary
 LIBB
 is focused on the ready-to-drink segment of the beverage industry. Through LIBB
 we are
engaged in the production and distribution of premium Non-Alcoholic Ready-to-Drink
 or &ldquo;NARTD
&rdquo; beverages.
LIBB&rsquo;s mission is to provide consumers with &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo; premium beverages offered at an affordable
price.

Our
beverage business is currently organized around our flagship iced tea product
 under the brand Long Island Iced Tea&reg;. The
Long Island Iced Tea name for a cocktail originated in Long Island in the 1970&rsquo;s
 and its national recognition is such that
it is ranked as the fourth most popular cocktail in restaurants and bars in the U.S. (Source: Nielsen CGA
 On-Premise Consumer
Survey
 2016). Our premium NARTD tea is made from a proprietary recipe and with quality components. Long Island Iced Tea&reg;
is sold in approximately 21 states across the U.S.
 primarily on the East Coast
 through a network of national and regional
retail chains and distributors.

We
also sell The Original Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade
 which is a NARTD functional beverage made from a proprietary recipe
with quality components. Since February 2016
 we have also been engaged in the aloe juice business
 under the brand ALO Juice.
ALO Juice is a NARTD functional beverage made from juice derived from the aloe plant known as aloe vera. ALO Juice sources its
aloe plants from harvests in Thailand. The plants are exported from there to South Korea where they are processed in a unique
whole leaf manner to ensure the nutritional and health benefits are maintained from the plant all the way through to the bottling
process.

In
February 2018
 our board of directors approved management&rsquo;s intentions to spin off LIBB (the &ldquo;Spinoff&rdquo;). The
Spinoff will allow us to focus exclusively on our move into the Blockchain technology industry. We aim to structure and complete
the Spinoff by the third quarter of 2018.

Corporate
History

We
were incorporated on December 23
 2014 in the State of Delaware under the name &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rdquo; as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Cullen.

On
May 27
 2015
 we closed the business combination (the &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan
of Reorganization (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;)
 dated as of December 31
 2014 and amended as of April 23
 2015
 by and
among Cullen
 us
 Cullen Merger Sub
 Inc.
 LIBB Acquisition Sub
 LLC
 LIBB
 Philip Thomas and Thomas Panza
 who formerly owned
a majority of the outstanding membership units of LIBB
 and the other former members of LIBB executing a joinder thereto. Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement
 (i) Cullen Merger Sub
 Inc. merged with and into Cullen
 with Cullen surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary
of ours and the stockholders of Cullen receiving one share of our common stock for every 15 shares of Cullen common stock held
by them and (ii) LIBB Acquisition Sub
 LLC merged with and into LIBB
 with LIBB surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours
and the members of LIBB receiving an aggregate of 2
633
334 shares of our common stock.


    
    


Upon
the closing of the Business Combination
 we became the new public company
 Cullen and LIBB became wholly-owned subsidiaries of
ours and the stockholders of Cullen and the members of LIBB became our stockholders. In addition
 the historical financial statements
of LIBB became our financial statements. As a result of the Business Combination
 the business of LIBB became our business. Cullen
is currently inactive and no significant operations are being undertaken by it. LIBB was formed as a limited liability company
under the laws of New York on February 18
 2011.

On
December 21
 2017
 we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our name from &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rdquo;
to &ldquo;Long Blockchain Corp.&rdquo;

Our
principal executive offices are located at 12-1 Dubon Court
 Farmingdale
 New York 11735. Our telephone number is (855) 542-2832.
Our website addresses are www.longblockchain.com and www.longislandicedtea.com. The information contained on

our corporate websites are not part of this annual report and you should not consider information contained on our websites to
be a part of this annual report or in deciding whether to purchase our common stock.


Listing


On
October 9
 2017
 we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (&ldquo;NASDAQ&rdquo;)
stating that
 for the last 30 consecutive business days
 the market value of our listed securities had been below the minimum
of $35 million required for continued listing on NASDAQ under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (the &ldquo;MVLS Rule&rdquo;). Pursuant
to the notice
 we had until April 9
 2018 to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule. In order to regain compliance
 the market value
of our listed securities was required to remain at $35 million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. On January
23
 2018
 we were notified by NASDAQ that we had regained compliance with the MVLS Rule. Then
 on February 15
 2018
 we received
a notice from NASDAQ stating that NASDAQ had determined to delist our securities under the discretionary authority granted to
NASDAQ pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5101. The notification letter stated that NASDAQ believed that we made a series of public statements
designed to mislead investors and to take advantage of public interest in bitcoin and Blockchain technology
 thereby raising
concerns about our suitability for exchange listing. The notification letter also stated that NASDAQ was revoking its January
23
 2018 notification to us that we had regained compliance with the MVLS Rule.

We
appealed the foregoing delisting to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel
 which appeal hearing was held on March 22
 2018. On April 10
 2018
we were notified that the NASDAQ Hearings Panel determined to affirm the delisting of our shares from NASDAQ
 and suspended trading
effective at the open of business on April 12
 2018. We intend to apply for our common stock to be quoted and traded on the OTCQB
Market. Effective April 12
 2018
 our common stock will be eligible for trading and quotation on the Pink Current Information
tier operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. (the &ldquo;OTC&rdquo;). Our trading symbol will remain LBCC.

Radium2
Capital Inc


On
November 27
 2017
 we completed a financing with Radium2 Capital Inc. (&ldquo;Radium&rdquo;). Pursuant to an Agreement
for the Purchase and Sale of Future Receipts with Radium the (&ldquo;Radium Agreement&rdquo;)
 we received cash
of $750
000
 less $7
500 of fees and expenses. The Radium borrowing is repaid at a minimum amount per week
 based upon 15% of
our gross sales
 until we have repaid a total of $986
250. The Radium Agreement further provides for a discount on the
repayment amount
 provided such prepay obligation of $838
313 is paid within 126 business days from the date of funding. The Radium
Agreement was accounted for as a borrowing
 with the difference between the repayment obligation and the net amount funded being
recorded as an original issue discount
 amortized using the interest method over the expected term of the arrangement. As of December
31
 2017
 the balance of the obligation
 net of the discount was $688
038
 and was presented as note payable
 current
 within
the consolidated financial statements. Since the repayment terms are based upon our actual future sales
 which are not fixed
we classified the obligation as a current liability. During the year ended December 31
 2017
 accreted discount amortization was
$ 47
437
 and was reflected as interest expense within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.


Court
Cavendish Ltd.


On
December 20
 2017
 we entered into the Option and Loan Agreement the (&ldquo;Cavendish Loan Agreement&rdquo;)
with Court Cavendish Ltd (&ldquo;Cavendish&rdquo;). The Cavendish Loan Agreement provides for the availability of an initial
$2
000
000 (&ldquo;Initial Facility Amount&rdquo;). Cavendish also agreed to allow for two extensions of $1
000
000 each (&ldquo;Extended
Facility Amount&rdquo;
 and together with the Initial Facility Amount
 the &ldquo;Facilities&rdquo;)
 as long as we continued
moving towards specific ventures related to the Blockchain technology and the Company remained compliant with its Nasdaq
regulations
 to increase the Facilities to $4
000
000 subject to Cavendish&rsquo;s approval. Interest on the Facilities shall
accrue monthly
 at a rate of 12.5% per annum
 on the unpaid principal balance commencing on the date of the first drawdown and
shall be due and payable
 without demand or notice
 at our election quarterly in cash or in our shares valued at the lower of
$3.00 or the closing price per share on the preceding date the interest payment is due. All principal and accrued interest under
the Facilities is due and payable on December 21
 2018. On such date
 at Cavendish&rsquo;s election
 we shall repay the outstanding
amount together with accrued interest either in cash or in shares of our common stock at the lower of $3.00 or the closing price
per share on such date
 but not lower than $2.00 per share. In connection with the Cavendish Loan Agreement
 a facility fee of
5% (&ldquo;Original Issue Discount&rdquo; or &ldquo;OID&rdquo;) of each of the Initial Facility Amount and the Extended Facility
Amount is payable on the date of the first drawdown under each such facility and payable in either cash or stock. The facility
fee on the Initial Facility Amount of $100
000 was withheld from the proceeds of the initial $750
000 funding under the Cavendish
Loan Agreement.



    
    


In
connection with the Initial Facility Amount
 we issued to Cavendish a warrant to purchase 100
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock with a three year life and an exercise price of $3.00 per share. This warrant had a gross fair value of $165
645
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Upon the first draw under the Extended Facility Amount
 we shall issue a warrant
to purchase an additional 50
000 shares of our common stock
 with the same terms
 for each of the $1
000
000 extensions that are
made available under the Extended Facility Amount.

The
$100
000 fee and the warrant to issue 100
000 shares of our common stock were considered costs of the Initial Facility Amount.

For
the Initial Facility Amount
 the $100
000 fee was charged in full as a cost of the facility and the warrant was charged on a relative
fair value basis
 or in the amount of $152
363. These costs were initially charged to deferred financing costs
 since these
costs were associated with the Initial Facility Amount and not to a single funding. Thereafter
 these deferred costs shall be
charged on a pro rata basis as a direct offset against the fundings as they occur
 and such costs would be amortized using the
interest method over the term of each funding loan.

On
December 21
 2017
 we requested a funding of $750
000 under the Initial Financing Facility
 which was received by us on December
22
 2017. OID costs of $37
500 and warrant costs of $57
136
 were from deferred financing costs were directly offset against this
funding.

We
then evaluated the funding transaction to determine whether or not there was a beneficial conversion feature. Accordingly
 we
determined that after the effect of the OID and the warrant
 that the effective conversion price was $2.13 per share. With a market
price of our common stock on December 20
 2017
 of $2.44
 we were determined to have a beneficial conversion feature with a value
of $94
636. The beneficial conversion feature was accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital and a direct offset
to the funded loan amount
 with such costs amortized using the interest method over the term of each funding loan.

On
December 26
 2017
 Cavendish elected to convert the initial drawdown amount
 plus interest
 of $750
700 into shares of our common
stock. Pursuant to the Cavendish Loan Agreement
 the conversion price was $3.00 per share. Accordingly
 an aggregate of 250
233
shares of common stock were issued to Cavendish. Accordingly
 in recording the conversion
 we recognized $189
272 in interest
expense for the unamortized debt discount and then the principal value of the note of $750
000 was credited to additional paid
in capital and common stock.

On
January 15
 2018
 Cavendish funded an additional drawdown of $750
000. We received the final drawdown of $500
000 of the Initial
Facility Amount on January 30
 2018. Since we are no longer listed on NASDAQ
 the remaining amount under the Extended Facility
Amount will not be available to us unless Cavendish were to waive this requirement.

on our gross sales of ALO Juice sales delivered to our customers after the closing of this agreement. The majority owner of Wilnah
is the former owner of Seba and the guarantor of its obligations. We believe that ALO Juice complements our &ldquo;better for
you&rdquo; beverage strategy
 and as such
 we intend to further leverage and grow the ALO Juice brand and distribution. At
December 31
 2017
 we fully impaired the ALO Juice intellectual property because we have de-emphasized the sale of our ALO Juice
in order to better manage our liquidity.

Blockchain
Business

Background
on Blockchain Technology

During
September 2008
 the global banking system was under tremendous strain
 resulting in the financial services sector needing liquidity
injections to avoid collapse. This situation lead to the birth of an idea for a peer-to-peer transactions system that would build
trust in financial transactions using technology that was crowd-consensus driven and decentralized. The concept became what is
now known as &ldquo;Bitcoin
&rdquo; a digital virtual global currency
 and the underlying technology that enabled it was termed
&ldquo;Blockchain.&rdquo;

The
Blockchain architecture gives participants the ability to share a ledger that is updated
 through peer-to-peer replication
 every
time a transaction occurs. The Blockchain network is economical and efficient because it eliminates duplication of effort and
reduces the need for intermediaries. The Blockchain is less vulnerable because it uses consensus models to validate information;
transactions are secure
 authenticated and verifiable.

The
Blockchain satisfies the global need of transaction networks that are fast and that provide a mechanism that establishes trust
while requiring no specialized equipment. The Blockchain network has no chargebacks or monthly fees and provides a collective
bookkeeping solution ensuring transparency and trust.



    
    




Blockchain
has the ability to bring greater efficiencies in how information is created
 shared
 accessed
 and secured
 and relies upon crowd
efforts for validating the correctness of the information. Decentralization is the core theme of Blockchain. After Blockchain&rsquo;s
apparent successful support of Bitcoin for years
 it is ready for implementation and experimentation in various other industries
and use cases
 including
 digitization of assets
 ownership of assets and various other financial market applications.

Blockchain
Technology 

In
a Blockchain
 copies of a ledger are &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; and validated by a consensus process
 with multiple users independently
verifying ledger changes. Blockchain is a sequential transaction database
 which contains a continuously growing list of all the
transactions which have occurred in the system. All the recent valid transactions are bunched into a block (hence the name blockchain)
which are then time-stamped and stored using strong cryptography. Blockchain relies on cryptography driven mining
 to stamp all
transactions uniquely
 which builds the trust in collaborative transparent technology process.

Every
new block added to the Blockchain database contains a hash (cryptographic hash) of the previous block
 which makes it tamper-resistant.
This is because changing any particular transaction in the Blockchain database would change the hash of the block being tampered
with
 which would cascade to all the subsequent blocks added in the Blockchain. The Blockchain database may be stored fully or
partially by a set of nodes
 which can verify any transaction being done on the Blockchain and these act in &ldquo;consensus&rdquo;.

In
traditional businesses and networks
 the authority to make decisions is still centralized though the actual processing is distributed
across several nodes globally. Although businesses previously employed a centralized data location
 companies today use distributed
networks to store and access data in order to avoid latency and connectivity problems. AWS
 BitTorrent and Akamai are a few examples
of centralized but distributed networks.

Blockchain
can be programmed to record many items of value in our lives
 such as: birth and death certificates
 marriage licenses
 deeds
and titles of ownership
 educational degrees
 financial accounts
 medical procedures
 insurance claims
 votes and anything else
that can be expressed in code. Using Blockchain
 we can build businesses and conduct transactions directly among participants
with less friction from outside intermediaries like banks
 brokers and governments. Institutions like banks or governments can
embrace this technology to revamp their operations
 cut costs
 boost trust
 increase commerce and create new value for their stakeholders.

Types
of Blockchain 

The
following are some of the more commonly used Blockchains:




    
    
Bitcoin
    Blockchain &ndash;The original native Blockchain
 which is the most used one in the market.

    
    
    

    
    
Ethereum
    &ndash;Invented to write trigger conditions based outcomes
 called &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo; within a software code
 on
    top of the Blockchain. It is most widely used for Blockchain development of new tokens within ICOs. 

    
    
    

    
    
Multichain
    &ndash; A faster and flexible version of Bitcoin Blockchain
 that lets you easily define assets
 alter mining and consensus
    process that make the platforms more efficient.

    
    
    

    
    
Hyperledger
    &ndash; An open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry Blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration
    hosted by The Linux Foundation
 including leaders in finance
 banking
 Internet of Things
 supply chains
 manufacturing and
    technology.



There
are many more Blockchain platforms available.

Key
Factors To Be Considered in Evaluating Blockchain Use



The
following are some of the key factors that are considered when evaluating Blockchain use:




    
    
Shared
    beneficial ownership
 striving to build a decentralized financial system
    where trust is built in a democratic fashion. While Bitcoin was initially a fringe technology
 it was scaled by the tech community
    and eventually became mainstream
 because it seemed to help the whole world and everyone had an equal opportunity to leverage
    the benefits of a secured decentralized ledger towards their business (like miners
 bitcoin exchanges
 developers of e. wallets
    etc.). Wikipedia
 Linux and several other open and crowd-sourced platforms have scaled in a similar fashion.

    
    
    

    
    
Independent
    mining achieves trust
    all transactions
 for some incentive
 build trust in a Blockchain. If the Blockchain application did not have enough
    independent participants
 the Blockchain transactions would not be so trustworthy.




    
    
True
    decentralization
 there must be no central point of
    failure. There is no dependence on one person
 one node
 one company
 one nation or one leader.

    
    
    

    
    
No
    contract among transacting parties
 payee and payer do not need to know each other.
    They do not need to have a legal agreement between them defining terms and conditions of their transaction.

    
    
    

    
    
Other
    factors
 including
 multiple parties executing the transactions
    transparency of transactions acceptable to all parties
 public or private Blockchain
 among others.



All
the above factors are very critical in evaluating whether or not one needs Blockchain in their business.

Business
Strategy

We
are seeking to become a full service Blockchain technology company. Our aim is to provide products and services to contribute
and generate revenues from all aspects of the Blockchain eco-system
 including digital trading (such as operating an exchange)
facilitation of digital currency storage (Crypto wallets)
 capital raising activities (ICO&rsquo;s) or DLT-based initiatives (Smart
KYC). As a public company
 we believe that we are in a prime position to build and acquire technology with global applications
using Blockchain technology.



As
our first step to becoming a full service Blockchain technology company
 we entered into the Hashcove Agreement in March
2018. Pursuant to the Hashcove Agreement
 we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hashcove from the Hashcove
Shareholders and Hashcove will become our wholly owned subsidiary. The closing of the transaction
 which is expected to occur
by the third quarter of 2018
 is subject to customary closing conditions
 including among others that neither we
nor Hashcove suffers a material adverse effect as described in the agreement. Accordingly
 there is no assurance that the transaction
will be consummated.


Hashcove
is an early stage UK-based technology company focused on developing and deploying globally scalable distributed ledger technology
solutions. Among its planned product offerings
 Hashcove is developing tokenized platforms
 crypto-exchanges and wallets
 smart
contracts for ICO&rsquo;s
 KYC and financial clearing technology on Blockchain
 and other related Blockchain applications. Hashcove&rsquo;s
product team includes 25 employees
 including developers
 with proven experience in enterprise financial trading algorithmic software.

Hashcove
would provide us with in-house expertise in a number of Blockchain products and strategic leadership as to Blockchain/DLT product
development and delivery. We believe moving in this direction will enable us to generate maximum revenue while maintaining full
control over the intellectual property related to such technologies. Assuming consummation of the transaction with Hashcove
 we
intend to seek to build decentralized Blockchain applications for clients around the globe
 across industries
 for uses as
varied as peer-to-peer lending
 healthcare and education. The opportunities could include developing Blockchain applications
on various Blockchain platforms including Ethereum and EOS. We would also look to leverage the core capability of Hashcove to
build its other planned products including Crypto wallet
 Crypto exchange
 ICO Smart contracts and KYC / Clearing on Blockchain.

Assuming
our acquisition of Hashcove is consummated
we will look to expand our business to allow for the generation of end-client acquisitions and formulate a solid distribution
model. This will be driven by our recent minority investments in SBL and TSLC. SBL focuses on developing and deploying globally
scalable blockchain technology solutions in the financial markets. SBL&rsquo;s wholly-owned subsidiary
 SGM
 is a FCA-regulated
brokerage that facilitates market access across multiple instruments including spot FX
 exchange traded futures and CFDs. TSLC
is the parent company of CASHe
 a leading provider of digital money and short-term financial products to young millennials across
India. TSLC also owns all of the intellectual property developed by CASHe and has the worldwide rights outside of India to the
application of its intellectual property for its lending and money transfer platform. We will seek to leverage our investment
in SBL to help Hashcove cross market and diversify its products and offerings and will seek to leverage our investment in TSLC
to diversity our distribution base for Blockchain-based products. SBL and TSLC offer us entry ways to very different segments
of the financial services market but that still have a need for Blockchain-based products. We believe this will allow Hashcove&rsquo;s
technology to service the full spectrum of customer segments and hopefully lead to additional avenues for its products.


Competitive
Strengths

We
believe that we have a competitive advantage over other companies by being an early public company in the Blockchain industry.
We are looking to take advantage of this opportunity by assembling a team of professionals qualified to identify opportunities
in the Blockchain industry. We currently utilize the experience and knowledge base of our management and independent and non-independent
directors to analyze potential opportunities. We are currently headed by Shamyl Malik
 our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Malik
brings over 13 years of experience at top tier investment banks and trading institutions. Prior to joining our company
 Mr. Malik
was Global Head of Trading at Voltaire Capital
 a leading liquidity provider in the foreign exchange market. Prior to joining
Voltaire Capital
 he served as Head of FX Electronic Trading at Morgan Stanley and Head of Electronic Market Making for Emerging
Markets and Precious Metals in the Capital Markets Division at Citibank. Mr. Malik began his investment banking career at Lehman
Brothers
 working in both New York and London across various derivative trading roles in fixed income
 commodities and currencies.
For nearly all his career he has been extremely focused on building and enhancing technology solutions in the financial markets
space.


    
    


Loretta
Joseph
 one of our independent directors
 has a significant background and experience in evaluating Blockchain opportunities.
Ms. Joseph has over 25 years of experience in the global financial services industry
 and is a Blockchain and technology advisor
to companies
 organizations and governments. She has held senior positions at investment banks across Asia and India where she
was responsible for managing multiple asset classes and emerging markets environments
 including RBS
 Macquarie Group
 Deutsche
Bank
 Credit Suisse and Elara Capital. Ms. Joseph has advised international banks
 and global hedge and pension funds in the areas
of portfolio management and exposure to derivatives and related products in emerging markets. Ms. Joseph serves as the Chair of
the Advisory Board of ADCCA (Australian Digital Currency and Commerce Association)
 an advocacy group dedicated to ensuring the
responsible adoption of Blockchain regulation. She also sits on the advisory boards of University of Western Sydney Business School
and Blume Ventures
 one of India&rsquo;s leading tech-focused early stage VCs
 and is an adjunct fellow at UWS Australia. She
received Fintech Australia&rsquo;s &ldquo;FinTech Leader of 2017&rdquo; and &ldquo;Female Leader of 2016&rdquo; awards
 and the
&ldquo;Alumni Award for Social Impact&rdquo; in 2016 from Sancta Sophia College.


Additionally
Kunal Nandwani
 Hashcove&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer
 recently joined our Blockchain Strategy Committee and upon consummation
of the transaction with Hashcove
 will become an executive officer and director of our company. Mr. Nandwani has been working
on Blockchain since early 2016. He is a consultant to the Indian Finance Ministry for policy making on various Fintech
subjects including algorithmic trading and Blockchain. Mr. Nandwani also cofounded uTrade Solutions
 a product firm which offers
trading
 algorithmic and risk platforms in more than 10 countries. Previously
 Mr. Nandwani worked at Lehman Brothers
 Nomura
&amp; BNP Paribas in London. Mr. Nandwani also runs an angel network in India and is an advisor to the Indian commerce ministry
on Artificial Intelligence.

We
plan to include additional members on the Blockchain Strategy Committee in the future.

We
also will seek to leverage the resources and experience of the management teams of our existing minority investments
 as they
are already collaborating and participating in the Blockchain industry. These minority investments in early stage assets provide
first-hand experience and knowledge to enable future technological developments
 as well as create exposure to a number of diversified
touchpoints into potential revenue streams derived from Blockchain sources.


Business
Opportunities

Blockchain
provides a digital ledger that can be programmed to record many items of value in our lives
 such as: birth and death certificates
marriage licenses
 deeds and titles of ownership
 educational degrees
 financial accounts
 medical procedures
 insurance claims
votes and anything else that can be expressed in code. Using Blockchain
 we can build businesses and conduct transactions directly
among participants with less friction from outside intermediaries like banks
 brokers and governments. Institutions like banks
or governments can embrace this technology to revamp their operations
 cut costs
 boost trust
 increase commerce and create new
value for their stakeholders.

Assuming
completion of the Hashcove acquisition
 our product offerings would include the following:

Crypto
Exchange &ndash; this would be a digital asset exchange utilizing Blockchain technology. There are currently over 170 exchanges
in various countries with limited regulatory oversight
 weak technology (when compared to exchanges for other asset classes) and
opaque KYC practices. By being a public company operating a robust digital exchange in a regulated environment
 we believe there
is a large amount of institutional trading volume in digital trading that can generate significant revenues for us.

Smart
Contracts for ICO&rsquo;s &ndash; we believe the ICO market will be the primary capital raising method for companies utilizing
Blockchain technology in the very near future replacing typical public offerings. Based on public information
 approximately $5.6
billion was raised by startup&rsquo;s in 2017 using ICO&rsquo;s. We believe providing the technology and legal framework behind
the ICO process is a sensible way to capitalize on the shift to ICO usage.

Crypto
Wallets &ndash; as more and more digital trading is executed by more traditional investors (retail and institutional)
 the demand
for Crypto wallets will increase. As part of a turnkey solution strategy in conjunction with the Crypto Exchange
 we would seek
to offer Crypto Wallets to customers that interact with us on our exchanges but also build technology that can be resold/white-labelled
for other exchanges or industries that require Crypto Wallet facilities.


    
    




We
may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Some of these entities are
well established and have management with significant experience in the Blockchain technology industry. Furthermore
 many of these
competitors possess greater technical
 human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited
when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Competitors may include start up companies that are just seeking to enter
the Blockchain technology industry as well as companies who are seeking to expand their existing businesses into the Blockchain
technology industry such as:



    
    
large
    companies like Chain
 IBM and Accenture;

    
    
    

    
    
blockchain
    platforms like Multichain
 Ripple and OmiseGo; and

    
    
    

    
    
several
    midsize Blockchain services firms like Opencrowd and Chainwork.


As
our market grows and rapidly changes
 we expect it will continue to attract new companies
 including smaller emerging companies
which could introduce new products and services. In addition
 we may expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors
in such markets. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with these or other companies in our industry.

Intellectual
Property

We
expect that our success will depend in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property
rights. We intend to rely on a combination of patents
 copyrights
 trademarks
 trade secret laws
 contractual provisions and confidentiality
procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. We will also seek to leverage the intellectual property rights that Hashcove
has with its existing products if we consummate our transaction with Hashcove.




Currently
the regulatory framework for Blockchain applications and technology is in its early stages. Certain Blockchain technologies that
deal with cryptocurrencies will likely be regulated in the near term. Many U.S. regulators
 including the SEC
 the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury
 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
 the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service
 and state regulators
 including the New York Department of Financial Services
 have made official pronouncements or issued
guidance or rules regarding the treatment of Blockchain technology and digital currencies. However
 other U.S. and state agencies
have not made official pronouncements or issued guidance or rules regarding the treatment of Blockchain technology or digital
currencies. Similarly
 the treatment of this industry is often uncertain or contradictory in other countries. The regulatory uncertainty
surrounding Blockchain technology could create risks for our business going forward.

Iced
Tea

Globally
NARTD tea products are ranked as the 4th largest beverage category
 behind carbonated soft drinks
 water and dairy. The non-alcohol
iced tea global category size is estimated at $55 billion and growing at a 6.6% compound annual growth rate (&ldquo;CAGR&rdquo;).
(Source: Euromonitor International
 &ldquo;Versatility of RTD Tea Generates Bright Spot in Global Soft Drinks&rdquo;
 May 2014).

We
have executed a select number of international distribution opportunities &ndash; recruiting an international beverage
consultant - with a mandate to initially effect distribution and co-pack agreements in Australia and New Zealand. We have also
established a footprint in South America with distribution agreements in Costa Rica
 Columbia
 Honduras and Ecuador
 with other
relationships pending.

The
U.S. non-alcoholic liquid refreshment beverage market consists of a number of different products
 and carbonated soft drinks (&ldquo;CSDs&rdquo;)
are the top selling beverage category. However
 consumers are increasingly coming to view CSDs (typically caffeinated as well
as high in sugar and preservatives) with disfavor. In volume
 the CSD category declined 0.6% in 2016
 1.5% in 2015
 1.6% in 2014
2.3% in 2013 and 1.5% in 2012. (Sources: Euromonitor International
 &ldquo;Carbonates in the US&rdquo;
 February 2017).


    
    


CSDs
have historically dominated the non-alcoholic liquid refreshment beverage market and been primarily controlled by two industry
giants
 Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. However
 a number of beverages began to emerge in the 1990s as alternatives to CSDs as part of
a societal shift towards beverages that are perceived to be healthier. The alternative beverage category of the market has resulted
in the birth of multiple new product segments that include sports drinks
 energy drinks and NARTD teas.

According
to a 2017 Euromonitor International industry report
 the U.S. NARTD tea segment was expected to have $7.1 billion of revenue in
2016
 a 7.9% increase from the prior year and an 8.3% annualized growth rate over the last 5 years (2011 &ndash; 2016) (Source:
Euromonitor International 
 &ldquo;RTD Tea in the US&rdquo;
 February 2017). The industry report also forecasted an annual revenue
growth rate of 5.3% over the coming five years
 with revenues reaching $9.2 billion in 2021.

As
shown below
 consumers showed special interest in healthier versions of NARTD teas
 preferring unsweetened teas.

Other
Brands

With
the growing and sustainable distribution base
 we now have the opportunity to develop domestic US and international brand portfolios
via merger and acquisition opportunities
 together with distribution and licensing opportunities. The building blocks we put in
place over the last twelve months across the East Coast
 including our partnership with Big Geyser
 provides us with the infrastructure
and management capabilities to pursue these extended goals.

Our
Products and Services

Long
Island Iced Tea&reg; was first launched in the New York metro market by LIBB in July 2011
 positioning itself as a premium iced
tea beverage offered at an affordable price. We help differentiate ourselves from competitors with a proprietary recipe and quality
components. Long Island Iced Tea&reg; is a 100% brewed tea
 using black tea leaves and purified water via reverse osmosis. It
is gluten-free
 free of genetically modified organisms
 or &ldquo;GMOs
&rdquo; and certified Kosher with no artificial colors
or preservatives.

Long
Island Iced Tea&reg; is primarily produced and bottled in the U.S. Northeast. This production in the Northeast
 combined with
its &ldquo;Made in America&rdquo; tag-line and brand name
 all improve its credentials as a part of the local community from which
we take our name.


    
    


We
have developed ten flavors of Long Island Iced Tea&reg; in an effort to ensure that our products meet the desired taste preferences
of consumers. Regular flavors
 which use natural cane sugar as a sweetener
 include lemon
 peach
 raspberry
 green tea &amp; honey
half tea &amp; half lemonade
 guava
 mango
 and sweet tea. Diet flavors
 which use sucralose (generic Splenda) instead of natural
cane sugar as a sweetener
 include diet lemon and diet peach. These flavors are currently available in twelve packs of 18oz polyethylene
terephthalate bottles.


During
2017
 we unveiled a new 18oz bottle and label design for our flagship Long Island Iced Tea&reg; Brand
 which replaced our 20oz
size. The sleeker and slimmer 18oz design accentuates an authentic and fresh spirit of Long Island Iced Tea&reg; products
 which
we believe will have a positive impact on our product gross margins. The bold and cleanly designed label aligns with our core
brand image
 clearly emphasizing the brand&rsquo;s premium ingredients and better-for-you positioning. Both the label and customized
bottle cap include informative health cues that include &ldquo;non-GMO
&rdquo; &ldquo;100% raw cane sugar
&rdquo; &ldquo;no additives
&rdquo;
and &ldquo;low calories&rdquo; for diet flavors.


We
have also developed The Original Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade
 which comes in nine real-fruit flavors
 that are sold in the
same locations as our iced tea.

ALO
Juice has been distributed in New York City since 2008 and in Florida since 2012. We commenced distribution of ALO Juice in February
2016. It is packed in 0.5 liter and 1.5 liter bottles
 with a wide variety of flavors including Original
 Mango
 Pomegranate
Pineapple and Raspberry. Aloe vera juice contains nutrients which include vitamins A
 C
 E
 and B12
 as well as minerals like
potassium
 zinc
 and magnesium. It also provides antioxidants
 helps to balance metabolism
 and supports normal circulation and
blood pressure.

Our
Competitive Strengths

We
believe that a differentiated brand will be a key competitive strength in the NARTD tea segment. Key points of differentiation
for Long Island Iced Tea&reg; and Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade include:



    
    
A
    better and bolder tasting bottled iced tea as a result of premium ingredients that include natural cane sugar (sucralose for
    diet flavors)
 hot-filled using black and green tea leaves
 that is offered at an affordable price;

    
    
    

    
    
Immediate
    global recognition of the &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; phrase associated with the cocktail;

    
    
    

    
    
Made
    in America;

    
    
    

    
    
Strong
    Northeast roots where it is locally produced;

    
    
    

    
    
The
    use of non-GMO ingredients; and

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    product being corn free
 hormone/antibiotic free
 gluten free
 natural and having no artificial color/flavor.



The
NARTD tea market is a crowded space and
 as a result
 we believe in pricing our products competitively. We highlight to consumers
our use of premium ingredients and our affordable price. The suggested retail price for a 18oz. bottle of Long Island Iced
Tea&reg; is $1.00 to $1.50
 and the suggested retail price for a 12oz. bottle is $1.00 to $1.25. The suggested retail price for
our gallon containers is $2.99 to $3.49. The suggested retail price of The Original Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade is $1.25
to $1.79 per 18oz bottle. ALO Juice&reg; has a suggested retail price of $1.49 to $1.79 for the 500 ml bottle and $2.39 to $2.79
for the 1.5 liter bottle. Management has set pricing levels to reflect current pricing dynamics in the industry. There has been
downward pressure on prices
 which management believes is caused by the entrance of major multinational beverage corporations
into the alternative beverage category. This is starting to lead towards industry consolidation
 in what is currently considered
a somewhat fragmented marketplace.


Our
Business Strategies 

We
are seeking to organically grow our NARTD tea and related product sales by capitalizing on an iconic name with unique brand awareness
to create familiar and easily recognizable beverages.


    
    


We
intend to increase our market share in our existing geographic markets and expand into additional geographic markets in the U.S.
We have established distribution in a number of small international markets and are exploring distribution in additional international
markets on a highly selective and limited basis

Customers
&rdquo; we generally focus our sales efforts on approaching beverage distributors and taking advantage of their
unique positioning in the retail industry. However
 a portion of our sales efforts are also dedicated to direct sales to retailers
because some wholesale chains request direct shipments from the product supplier. In addition
 we are exploring several new sales
channels. We currently are conducting a small scale business trial in which we sell our beverage product alongside other snacks
in vending machines. We also sell our twelve-ounce lower calorie products in schools
 in some cases through sales to purchasing
cooperatives that represent multiple school districts
 but also via the vending machine business trial.

In
March 2017
 we entered into a long-term strategic distribution agreement with Big Geyser
 a large independent non-alcoholic beverage
distributor in metro New York
 pursuant to which Big Geyser became the exclusive distributor of our iced tea bottle products.
The agreement covers retail locations in the New York City metro region
 including the five boroughs of New York City
 Long Island
Westchester and Putnam County. This distribution coverage has the potential to significantly increase our distribution footprint
and allow us to streamline our business and brings additional focus to building our brand. We are committed to building this relationship
including the recruitment of Robert Stefanizzi and a team of experienced industry professionals focused on expanding our products
into Big Geyser&rsquo;s distribution network.

We
continually seek to better develop emerging markets
 as well as expand our overall geographic footprint. We have entered into
new business arrangements involving international specialists contracted to (i) identify new market opportunities and (ii) assist
in the overall management of our international expansion efforts. During 2017
 we announced the appointment of a New Zealand based
distributor and an Australian based distributor
 as well as an Australian based co-packer with capability to produce products
for Australasia and Asia. We have also focused on the development of markets in South America
 and have announced expansion into
Costa Rica
 Columbia
 Honduras
 Ecuador and other Latin American countries. We have worked alongside existing distributor partnerships
in Puerto Rico
 Canada and South Korea to further expand distribution points throughout their respective markets.

Our
strategy for ALO Juice includes increasing brand support through our existing sales and marketing team
 ultimately accelerating
points of distribution throughout current (and future) distributor and retail partnerships alongside our flagship iced tea and
lemonade products.

We
are currently securing ownership of the &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; trademark in selective international jurisdictions
via the Madrid protocol. Domestically
 we are building our brand primarily by establishing comprehensive marketing plans that
include but are not limited to trade marketing
 customer appreciation programs
 social media
 pricing promotions and demos via
brand ambassadors.

In
the past twelve months
 we have secured two material brand building
 awareness and trial mechanics through the sponsorships of
1) Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum and 2) Barclays Center. These properties reinforce brand ownership in our key New York markets
and promote trial and adoption across key demographics.

We
also use co-op advertising (advertisements by retailers that include the specific mention of manufacturers
 who
 in turn
 repay
the retailers for all or part of the cost of the advertisement) and special promotions
 together with its retail partners
 so
as to complement other marketing efforts towards brand awareness.

We
also seek to expand our product line. From time to time
 we explore and test market potential of new NARTD products that may
in the future
 contribute to our operating performance. We expect that the introduction of The Original Long Island Brand&trade;
Lemonade and growth of ALO Juice will be able to attract a new market segment of beverage drinkers.

Manufacturing
and Raw Materials

Long
Island Iced Tea&reg; and Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade are currently produced by Brooklyn Bottling Group
 Polar Corp.
 and
LiDestri Spirits
 all of which are established co-packing companies with reputable quality control. We intend to identify additional
co-packers in the U.S. and other countries to support the continued growth of the brand. ALO Juice is purchased as a finished
product from a third party supplier in South Korea.

The
principal raw materials we use in our iced tea and lemonade business are bottles
 caps
 labels
 packaging materials
 tea essence
and tea base
 lemonade base
 sugar
 natural flavors and other sweeteners
 juice
 electricity
 fuel and water. Our principal iced
tea suppliers for the year ended December 31
 2017 were Zuckerman-Honickman
 Inc. (bottles)
 US Sweeteners Corp. (sugar) and Allen
Flavors
 Inc. (natural flavors) who
 together with Brooklyn Bottling Corp. (copacker)
 accounted for 70% of our purchases of raw
materials inventory and copacking fees. Our principal suppliers for the year ended December 31
 2016
 were Zuckerman-Honickman
Inc. (bottles) and Allen Flavors
 Inc. (natural flavors) who
 together with Lidestri Spirits (copacker)
 accounted for 46% of
our purchases of inventory and copacking fees. In addition
 23% of our purchases were related to the purchase of finished bottled
ALO Juice
 which is purchased from suppliers located in South Korea.


    
    


Our
relationships with our suppliers and co-packers are typically governed by short-term purchase orders or similar arrangements.
We do not have any material contracts or other material arrangements with these parties and presently do not mitigate our exposure
to volatility in the prices of raw materials or co-packing services through the use of forward contracts
 pricing agreements or
other hedging arrangements. Accordingly
 we are subject to fluctuations in the costs of our raw materials and co-packing services.

Furthermore
some of our raw materials
 such as bottles
 caps
 labels
 tea essence and tea base
 sugar
 natural flavors and other sweeteners
and juice
 are available from only a few suppliers. As a result
 we may be subject to substantial increases in prices or shortages
of raw materials
 if the suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements.

Our
Customers

We
sell our products to a mix of independent mid-to-large size beverage distributors who in turn sell to retail outlets
 such as
big chain supermarkets
 mass merchants
 convenience stores
 restaurants and hotels principally in the New York
 New Jersey
 Connecticut
and Pennsylvania markets. We have also begun expansion into other geographic markets
 such as Florida
 Virginia
 Massachusetts
New Hampshire
 Maryland
 North Carolina
 South Carolina and parts of the Midwest. Our products are currently available
in twenty one states that have a cumulative population of 100 million. While we primarily sell our products indirectly
through distributors
 at times we sell directly to the retail outlets and we may sell to certain retail outlets both directly
and indirectly through distributors. We also sell our products directly to the distribution facilities of some of our retailers.


For
the year ended December 31
 2017
 two customers
 Garden Foods and Big Geyser
 accounted for 25% and 14% of our net sales
 respectively.
For the year ended December 31
 2016
 our top customers
 Seba Distribution LLC and Garden Foods
 accounted for 20% and 11% of
our net sales
 respectively.

Our
sales are typically governed by short-term purchase orders. We do not have any material contracts or other material arrangements
with our customers or distributors and do not obtain commitments from them to purchase or sell a minimum amount of our products
or to purchase or sell such products at a minimum price. Because our sales may be concentrated with a few customers
 our results
of operations may be materially adversely affected if one of these customers significantly reduces the volume of its purchases
or demands a reduction in price
 which may occur at any time due to the absence of such purchase commitments.

Management



We
have established a beverage sub-committee of our board to provide oversight of the beverage business. The sub-committee has delegated
day-to-day management of the beverage business to Philip Thomas
 the former Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr.
Thomas has substantial experience in the beverage industry.

Operations
and Assets

We
currently use co-packing companies
 Brooklyn Bottling Group
 Polar Corp.
 and LiDestri Spirits to manufacture Long Island Iced
Tea&reg; and Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade. The product is shipped directly to distributors or retailers as well as to our
warehouse in Farmingdale
 NY or our other storage facilities prior to delivery to sales partners. Principal assets include
vehicles to support the marketing of the brand and to transport the product
 as well as storage equipment for the warehouse. Our
principal assets also include display equipment such as vending machines
 refrigerators and racks. This equipment is strategically
placed at retail locations in order to market our product line.

We
purchase our aloe juice product through a third party supplier in its finished form. There are no current operations or assets;
however
 after the close of the asset purchase agreement we will acquire only the intellectual property to produce ALO Juice including
tradenames
 formulas
 and recipes.



The
beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. As the iced tea beverage segment
 including Long Island Iced Tea&reg;
experiences its highest levels of demand during the warm spring and summer months
 cold or rainy weather during this time may
have a short-term impact on customer demand and therefore result in lower sales.



    
    





The
beverage industry is extremely competitive. Long Island Iced Tea&reg; is competing with a wide range of beverages that
are produced by a large number of manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad public recognition for many years
 accomplished
through continuous and well-funded marketing campaigns. We will compete with all types of beverages
 both CSDs and non-CSDs
 facing
higher competition from direct product competitors in the NARTD tea market. Key direct competitors are Arizona Beverage Company
Unilever
 Dr. Pepper Snapple Group
 Inc. and Nestle SA. In order to be able to compete successfully in the industry
 we have to
distinguish our products in price and in taste and flavor
 and offer attractive promotions to customers and appealing packaging.
Moreover
 we will have to well position the brand with targeted sales and marketing campaigns.


The
aloe juice business is a fast growing industry as consumer demand grows for a &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo; beverage that has healthy
benefits and is great tasting. The aloe juice segment is projected to experience high growth worldwide for the foreseeable future
and there will be opportunities for new entrances in the market. The presence of small and large vendors makes the global aloe
vera-based drinks market extremely fragmented. Intense competition prevails in the market in terms of price
 quality
 innovation
reputation
 and distribution. Key direct competitors that provide a high quality aloe juice product are OKF Aloe King
 Alo Farms
Forever Living Products
 and Houssy Global.

Intellectual
Property

&ldquo;Long
Island Iced Tea&rdquo; is a trademark of ours. We currently have federal registration of the trademark &ldquo;Long Island Iced
Tea&rdquo; and are pursuing such registration of the trademark &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand.&rdquo; We intend to seek
registration of such trademarks in other countries as well. In addition
 we are seeking or plan to seek a number of other trademarks
for tag lines and product designs.

We
filed applications with the USPTO for the registration of the trademark &ldquo;Long Island Brand Iced Tea&rdquo; on August 28
2012 and subsequently for the registration of the trademark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; on July 23
 2013. Both applications
encountered resistance to registration as a result of the existence of the mark &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo; for &ldquo;iced tea.&rdquo;
We determined that the mark &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo; for &ldquo;iced tea&rdquo; was abandoned. As a result we filed a petition
to cancel the registration on this ground. In January 2015
 the petition was granted and the mark was cancelled. Accordingly
we petitioned for the mark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; to be placed on the supplemental register. On April 19
 2016
 the
USPTO registered the mark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; (Registration No. 4
943
056) on the supplemental register. Registration
on the supplemental register allows the use of the &ldquo;&reg;&rdquo; symbol
 blocks later filed applications for confusingly
similar marks
 and allows us to sue infringers in federal court which has well-settled case law and standards. Notwithstanding
the foregoing
 the supplemental register does not provide all the protection of a registration on the principal register. At this
time
 the mark is not &ldquo;incontestable&rdquo; and we may be open to claims of others contesting the trademark.

In
addition
 we have filed trademark applications for &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; as a standard character mark and
as a stylized mark
 which are pending before the USPTO. In each case
 the application is for use of the trademark with iced tea
tea based products
 juices
 water
 beverages and other similar products. &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; standard
character trademark has been in use in commerce by us since at least as early as February 29
 2012. We also plan to file for stylized
marks protecting certain other tag lines and product designs. With respect to the pending trademark applications for &ldquo;The
Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; (standard character mark and stylized mark)
 the USPTO has made an initial determination that
both marks are geographically descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded the company the opportunity
to produce evidence to establish that the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce. Similar issues
 or other issues
also may arise in connection with the other marks for which we are seeking registration or intend to seek registration. Registration
of these marks will allow us to utilize the &ldquo;&reg;&rdquo; symbol to notify others that our marks are federally registered
and allow us to enforce these marks in federal court
 among other benefits. There can be no assurance
 however
 that the USPTO
will approve these applications.

Our
intellectual property is protected through the acquisition of registered and unregistered trademarks as described above
 the acquisition
of patents
 the maintenance of trade secrets
 the development of trade dress
 and
 where appropriate
 litigation against those
who are
 in our opinion
 infringing our intellectual property rights. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade
secret
 unfair competition
 trademark
 copyright and other similar laws to protect our intellectual property
 including product
design
 product research and concepts and trademarks
 against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights could result
in a substantial cost to us
 and diversion of our efforts
 management believes that the protection of our intellectual property
will be a key component of our operating strategy. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 there can be no assurance that the trademarks
described above or our other intellectual property rights will adequately protect information that we deem to be proprietary.

Environmental
and Other Regulations

The
conduct of our businesses
 and the production
 distribution
 sale
 advertising
 labeling
 safety
 transportation and use of our
products
 are and will be subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal
 state and local governmental agencies
in the U.S.
 as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets where we may
operate and sell products.

In
the U.S.
 we are or may be required to comply with federal laws
 such as the Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act
 the Occupational Safety
and Health Act
 the Clean Air Act
 the Clean Water Act
 the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
 laws governing equal employment
opportunity
 customs and foreign trade laws and regulations
 laws regulating the sales of products in schools
 and various other
federal statutes and regulations. We will rely on legal and operational compliance programs
 as well as local counsel
 to guide
our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our third-party
co-manufacturer is also required to comply with Food and Drug Administration requirements for manufacturing of our product.

We
also may in the future be affected by other existing
 proposed and potential future regulations or regulatory actions
 including
those described below
 any of which could adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. Changes
in government regulation
 or failure to comply with existing regulations
 could adversely affect our business. Public health officials
and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity
 especially as the disease
affects children
 and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. There also has been an
increased focus on caffeine content in beverages.

Legislation
has been enacted in certain U.S. states in which our products may be sold that requires collection and recycling of containers
or that prohibits the sale of our beverages in certain non-refillable containers unless a deposit or other fee is charged. It
is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.

We
do not anticipate at this time that the cost of compliance with U.S. and foreign laws will have a material financial impact on
our operations
 business or financial condition
 but there are no guarantees that new regulatory and tariff legislation may not
have a material negative effect on our business in the future.

Research
and Development

We
have incurred approximately $359
554 and $192
857 to research opportunities related to new product initiatives. These costs were
reflected in research and development expense for the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.



At
December 31
 2017
 we had 25 full time employees. We also engaged the services of independent contractors to assist our management
team in developing our product offerings.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS


An
investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding to invest in our securities
 you should carefully
consider the risks described below. These risks and uncertainties are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
If any of these risks actually occurs
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected. In that case
 you may lose all or part of your investment in the securities.


Risks
Related to Our Blockchain Business 

We
have virtually no operating history as a Blockchain business
 which makes it hard to evaluate our ability to generate revenue
through operations
 and at the date of this filing
 we have not generated revenue from any Blockchain-based products.

Our
minimal operating history as a Blockchain business makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects. We
have encountered
 and will continue to encounter
 risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly
developing and changing industries
 including challenges in forecasting accuracy
 determining appropriate uses of our limited
resources
 gaining market acceptance
 managing a complex regulatory landscape and developing new products. Our current operating
model may require changes in order for us to scale our operations efficiently. Investors in our common stock should consider our
business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties it faces as an early-stage company focused on developing products
in the field of financial technology. To date
 we have focused on developing our business and exploring opportunities for novel
applications of Blockchain technology. As a result of our early stage of development
 we have not generated revenue from any commercially
available Blockchain-based products. We have generated no revenue as a Blockchain business.

Our
management has relatively little experience in the blockchain technology industry.

Our
management only recently determined to shift our primary corporate focus towards the exploration of
 and investment in
 opportunities
that leverage the benefits of Blockchain technology. Our management has limited experience in the Blockchain technology industry.
While we intend to expand our staff with individuals with more experience in this industry and will closely scrutinize any individuals
we engage
 we cannot assure you that well-qualified individuals will be available to us or that our assessment of individuals
we retain will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of being involved in a public company
which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive
and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.

We
expect to develop new Blockchain-based products
 but as of the date of this filing we have not commenced such development.

We
intend to develop new Blockchain-based products covering all aspects of the Blockchain eco-system. However
 at the date of this
filing
 we have not commenced development of any such products. Although we have entered into the Hashcove Agreement to acquire
Hashcove
 which is developing certain Blockchain-based products
 there can be no assurance that we will consummate such acquisition.
In addition
 Hashcove is only in the preliminary stages of development of its Blockchain-based products. The development of such
products implicates complex technological considerations and raises numerous legal and regulatory issues that will need to be
addressed. As a result of these technological
 legal and regulatory considerations
 the Blockchain-based products may never be
developed and
 if developed
 may
 for a variety of technological
 legal and regulatory reasons
 never become operational.

Even
if we successfully develop our Blockchain-based products
 we may not be able to successfully market and launch them.

Our
Blockchain-based products
 if successfully developed
 may not meet customer or user expectations. Furthermore
 despite good faith
efforts to develop and complete the launch of
 and subsequently to maintain
 such products
 it is possible that they will experience
malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately maintained. We may not have or may not be able to obtain the technical skills
expertise
 or regulatory approvals needed to successfully develop our Blockchain-based products and progress them to a successful
launch. While we are seeking to retain
 or acquire businesses who have retained
 experts
 there may
 from time to time
 be a general
scarcity of management
 technical
 scientific
 research and marketing personnel with appropriate training to develop and maintain
such products. In addition
 there are significant legal and regulatory considerations that will need to be addressed in order
to develop and maintain such products
 and addressing such considerations will require significant time and resources. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to develop products that achieves our goals and satisfy the complex regulatory requirements
that are applicable. If we are not successful in our efforts to develop products that are compliant with all regulatory and legal
requirements and to demonstrate to customers and users the utility and value of the products
 it may be impermissible to launch
the products or there may not be sufficient demand for the launch of the products to be commercially viable
 and our business
would be materially adversely affected.



    
    



Our
Blockchain-based products
 if successfully developed and launched
 may not function properly.

Our
Blockchain technology may not function properly
 which would have a material adverse effect on our plans
 operations and financial
condition. We intend to build Blockchain-based products covering all aspects of the Blockchain eco-system
 but if our technology
does not work as anticipated
 there may be no satisfactory alternative available. Any problems in the functionality of our technology
would have a direct materially adverse effect on our plans and expectations for revenues. The technology may malfunction because
of internal problems or as a result of cyber-attacks or external security breaches. Any such technological problems would have
a material adverse effect on our prospects.

Our
Blockchain-based products
 if successfully developed and launched
 may not be widely adopted and may have limited users.

It
is possible that our Blockchain-based products
 if successfully developed and launched
 will not be used by a large number of
customers or users. In addition
 legal and regulatory developments could render the products obsolete or impermissible. Such a
lack of use or interest could negatively impact the effectiveness of the products
 and our business and financial position.

We
intend to offer advisory services to companies considering or pursuing ICOs
 but we have not yet been engaged to do so.

We
intend to offer advisory services to companies considering or pursuing ICOs. To date
 we have not been engaged to provide advisory
services to any other company considering or pursuing an ICO
 and there can be no assurance that we will be engaged to provide
any such services in the future or that any such services
 if provided
 will be profitable. If we are engaged to provide any such
services
 we could face claims from any dissatisfied clients and could incur liabilities in rendering any such services
 any of
which could also damage our reputation and adversely affect other parts of our business.

The
popularity of digital assets and cryptocurrencies and ICOs may decrease in the future
 which could have a material adverse effect
on the digital asset cryptocurrency industry and our operations and financial condition.

We
intend to develop and commercialize financial technology based on the use of digital assets
 cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology.
In recent years
 digital assets and cryptocurrencies have become more widely accepted among investors and financial institutions
but have been also faced increasingly complex legal and regulatory challenges and
 to date
 have not benefited from widespread
adoption by governments
 central banks or established financial institutions. However
 any significant decrease in the acceptance
or popularity of digital asset or cryptocurrency or ICOs may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition
and a material adverse effect on us.

Acquisitions
we have made and may make will increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.

We
have purchased interests in SBL and TSLC. In addition
 we may from time to time purchase interests in or acquire other businesses
or the assets of other businesses. Integrating an acquired business or its assets involves a number of risks and financial
 managerial
and operational challenges. We may incur significant expenses in connection with purchases or acquisitions it has made in the
past or may make in the future. Further
 acquisitions may also create a need for additional accounting
 tax
 compliance
 documentation
risk management and internal control procedures
 and may require us to hire additional personnel to implement
 perform and/or
monitor such procedures. To the extent our procedures are not adequate to appropriately implement
 perform and/or monitor all
necessary procedures relating to any new or expanded business
 we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction.
The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.



    
    



If
we do not keep pace with technological changes
 our solutions may become less competitive and our business may suffer.

The
market for Blockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological change
 frequent product and service innovation and evolving
industry standards. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our future product offerings that achieve market
acceptance or that keep pace with these technological developments
 our business could be adversely affected. The success of enhancements
new features and solutions depends on several factors
 including the timely completion
 introduction and market acceptance of
the enhancements or new features or solutions. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition
we may need to continuously modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware
 software
communication
 browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements
or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion. Furthermore
 uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms
or technologies
 or modifications to existing platforms or technologies
 could increase our research and development expenses.
Any failure of our solutions to keep pace with technological changes or operate effectively with future network platforms and
technologies could reduce the demand for our solutions
 result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business.

We
may face substantial competition from a number of known and unknown competitors as well as the risk that one or more of them may
obtain patents covering technology critical to the operation of our products.

We
believe that a number of organizations are or may be working to develop products systems utilizing distributed ledger or Blockchain
technologies or other novel technologies that may be competitive to the technology we intend to develop. Some or all of such organizations
may have substantially greater technological expertise
 experience with distributed ledger technologies and/or financial resources
than we have
 and they may attempt to patent technologies that may be competitive with or similar to the technology we ultimately
use. If one or more other persons
 companies or organizations
 individually or together obtain a substantial share of our intended
market
 or obtain a valid patent covering technology critical to our products
 and we are unable or unwilling to license the technology
we may be unable to sell our products or it could become impossible for our products to operate
 which could have a material adverse
effect on our operations and financial condition.

Adverse
economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact our business.

Our
business depends on the overall demand for technology and on the economic health of our prospective customers. In general
 worldwide
economic conditions remain unstable
 and these conditions may make it difficult for our prospective customers and us to forecast
and plan future business activities accurately
 and they could cause our prospective customers to reevaluate their decision to
purchase our solutions. Weak global economic conditions
 or a reduction in technology spending even if economic conditions improve
could adversely impact our business
 financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways
 including longer sales
cycles
 lower prices for our solutions
 reduced bookings and lower or no growth.

Our
ability to attract
 train and retain qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and any future growth.

To
execute our growth plan
 we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense
especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services
 senior
sales executives and professional services personnel with appropriate financial reporting experience. We have
 from time to time
experienced
 and we expect to continue to experience
 difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications.
Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees
from competitors or other companies
 their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees have breached their legal
obligations or that we have induced such breaches
 resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. If we fail to attract new
personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel
 our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.



    
    



Our
planned products and any Blockchain on which our products may rely may be the target of malicious cyber-attacks or may contain
exploitable flaws in its underlying code
 which may result in security breaches and the loss or theft of digital assets. If such
attacks occur or security is compromised
 this could expose us to liability and reputational harm and could seriously curtail
the utilization of our products and cause a decline in the market price of the digital assets on that system
 and could result
in claims against us.

If
our products are successfully developed and launched
 our software
 the software applications and other interfaces or applications
upon which they rely
 and any software that may be built upon our products
 will be unproven
 and there can be no assurances that
our products and the creating
 transfer or storage of digital assets on our products will be uninterrupted or fully secure
 which
may result in impermissible transfers
 a complete loss of users&rsquo; digital assets on that system or an unwillingness of customers
and users to access
 adopt and utilize our products. Further
 the digital assets with which are products are used (and any technology
including Blockchain technology
 on which they rely) may also be the target of malicious attacks seeking to identify and exploit
weaknesses in the software
 the digital assets or our products
 which may result in the loss or theft of digital assets on that
system. Such attacks may come in anticipated forms or unanticipated forms.

We
and our subsidiaries are
 and our products
 if developed and launched
 and the Blockchain technology to be utilized by our products
will be
 subject to cyber-attacks
 security risks and risks of security breaches. An attack on any of them or a breach of security
of any of them could result in a loss of private data
 unauthorized trades
 and an interruption of trading for an extended period
of time. Any such attack or breach could adversely affect our ability to effectively operate or sell our Blockchain products
which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Such an attack may also damage our reputation
and any breach of data security that exposes or compromises the security of any of the private digital keys used to authorize
or validate transaction orders
 or that enables any unauthorized person to generate any of the private digital keys
 could result
in unauthorized trades. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in claims against us and us and could have a material
adverse effect on us and the holders of our securities.&nbsp;

The
regulatory regime governing Blockchain technologies
 cryptocurrencies
 digital assets
 and offerings of digital assets is uncertain
and any new regulations or policies
 may materially adversely affect the development and the value of such cryptocurrencies and
assets.

Regulation
of digital assets
 cryptocurrencies
 Blockchain technologies
 and cryptocurrency exchanges is currently undeveloped and likely
to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. Regulation also varies significantly among international
federal
 state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in
the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws
 regulations
 or guidance
 or take other actions
 which
may severely impact the permissibility of digital assets and cryptocurrencies generally and the technology behind them or the
means of transaction or in transferring them. Failure by us to comply with any laws
 rules and regulations
 some of which may
not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change
 could result in a variety of adverse consequences
including civil penalties and fines.

Cryptocurrency
networks
 distributed ledger technologies
 and coin and token offerings also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign
jurisdictions. Various foreign jurisdictions may
 in the near future
 adopt laws
 regulations or directives that may conflict
with those of the United States or may directly and negatively impact our business. The effect of any future regulatory change
is impossible to predict
 but such change could be substantial and materially adverse to our business.

On
July 25
 2017 the SEC released an investigative report which states that the United States would
 in some circumstances
 consider
the offer and sale of blockchain tokens pursuant to an ICO subject to federal securities laws. Thereafter
 China released statements
and took similar actions. Although the Company does not currently participate in ICOs
 we intend to do so in the future
 and these
actions may be a prelude to further action which chills widespread acceptance of Blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption and have
a material adverse effect the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all
 which would
have a material adverse effect on the business
 prospects or operations of the Company.

Our
business will be subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy
 technology
 data protection
and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation
 and could result in
claims
 changes to our business practices
 increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business.

We
will be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business
including user privacy
 Blockchain technology
 data protection and intellectual property
 among others. Foreign data protection
privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. These U.S. federal and state
and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition
 the application
and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain
 particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in
which we operate.



    
    



We
will adopt policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws. The growth of our business and its expansion outside of
the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our
being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been
fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts
 and are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought
against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations
 even if we successfully defend against it
 could cause us to incur
significant legal expenses and divert our management&rsquo;s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are
found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations
 we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the
violation
 including civil and criminal penalties
 damages and fines
 we could be required to refund payments received by it
and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business
and its financial results. These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede
the development of new products
 result in negative publicity
 increase our operating costs
 require significant management time
and attention
 and subject us to claims or other remedies
 including fines or demands that we modify or ceases our planned business
practices.

The
further development and acceptance of Blockchain networks
 which are part of a new and rapidly changing industry
 are subject
to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of Blockchain
networks and digital assets would have a material adverse effect on our business plans and could have a material adverse effect
on us.

The
growth of the Blockchain industry in general
 as well as the Blockchain networks on which digital assets and cryptocurrencies
rely
 is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the digital asset and cryptocurrency
industry
 as well as Blockchain networks
 include
 without limitation:



    
    
worldwide
    growth in the adoption and use of digital assets
 cryptocurrencies and other Blockchain technologies;

    
    
government
    and quasi-government regulation of digital assets and cryptocurrencies and their use
 or restrictions on or regulation of
    access to and operation of Blockchain networks or similar systems;

    
    
the
    maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of digital assets or cryptocurrency networks;

    
    
changes
    in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;

    
    
the
    availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services
 or trading assets including
    new means of using government-backed currencies or existing networks;

    
    
general
    economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets and cryptocurrencies; and

    
    
a
    decline in the popularity or acceptance of digital assets
 cryptocurrencies or other Blockchain-based tokens.



The
digital asset and cryptocurrency industries as a whole have been characterized by rapid changes and innovations and are constantly
evolving. Although it has experienced significant growth in recent years
 the slowing or stopping of the development
 general
acceptance and adoption and usage of Bockchain networks and Blockchain assets may materially adversely affect our business plans.

The
development and operation of our business
 including any or our Blockchain-based products
 will likely require technology and
intellectual property rights.

Our
ability to develop and operate Blockchain-based products may depend on technology and intellectual property rights that we may
license from unaffiliated third parties. If for any reason we were to fail to comply with our obligations under the applicable
license agreement
 or were unable to provide or were to fail to provide the technology and intellectual property that our products
require
 they would be unable to operate
 which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition
and could have a material adverse effect on us.

We
may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.

We
may be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others
 by offering allegedly infringing products
or otherwise. Any claims may result in significant expenditure of our financial and managerial resources
 and may result in us
making significant damages or settlement payments or changes to our business. We could be prohibited from using software or business
processes
 or required to obtain licenses from third parties
 which could be expensive or unavailable. Any such difficulties could
have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.




    
    




We
may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.

Our
success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary intellectual property rights.
We may be unable to protect it
 in the United States or elsewhere
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Banks
and financial institutions may not provide banking services
 or may cut off services
 to businesses that provide blockchain-related
services or that accept cryptocurrencies as payment
 including financial institutions of investors in the Company&rsquo;s securities.

A
number of companies that provide Blockchain-related services have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are
willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly
 a number of companies and individuals or businesses
associated with Blockchain technologies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services
discontinued with financial institutions. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty
that many businesses that provide cryptocurrency and/or other Blockchain-related services have and may continue to have in finding
banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services may be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment
system and harming public perception of cryptocurrencies and could decrease its usefulness and harm its public perception in the
future. Similarly
 the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and the public perception of Blockchain technologies
could be damaged if banks or financial institutions were to close the accounts of businesses providing cryptocurrency and/or other
Blockchain-related services. This could occur as a result of compliance risk
 cost
 government regulation or public pressure.
The risk applies to securities firms
 clearance and settlement firms
 national stock and commodities exchanges
 the over the counter
market and the Depository Trust Company
 which
 if any of such entities adopts or implements similar policies
 rules or regulations
could result in the inability of our investors to open or maintain stock or commodities accounts
 including the ability to deposit
maintain or trade the Company&rsquo;s securities. Such factors would have a material adverse effect the ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all
 which would have a material adverse effect on the business
 prospects
or operations of the Company and harm investors.

The
price of the Company&rsquo;s shares could be subject to wide price swings since the value of cryptocurrencies may be subject to
pricing risk and have historically been subject to wide swings in value.

The
Company&rsquo;s shares are subject to arbitrary pricing factors that are not necessarily associated with traditional factors that
influence stock prices or the value of non-cryptocurrency assets such as revenue
 cashflows
 profitability
 growth prospects or
business activity levels since the value and price
 as determined by the investing public
 may be influenced by future anticipated
adoption or appreciation in value of cryptocurrencies or the Blockchain generally
 factors over which the Company has little or
no influence or control. The Company&rsquo;s share prices may also be subject to pricing volatility due to supply and demand factors
associated with few or limited public company options for investment in the segment
 which may benefit the Company in the near
term and change over time.

In
addition
 the success of the Company
 the Company&rsquo;s share price
 and the interest in investors and the public in the Company
as an early entrant into the Blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem may in large part be the result of the Company&rsquo;s early
emergence as a publicly traded company in which holders of appreciated cryptocurrency have an opportunity to invest inflated cryptocurrency
profits for shares of the Company
 which could be perceived as a way to maintaining investing exposure to the Blockchain and cryptocurrency
markets without exposing the investor to the risk in a particular cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency holders have realized exponential
value due to large increases in the prices of cryptocurrencies and may seek to lock in cryptocurrency appreciation
 which investing
in the Company&rsquo;s securities may be perceived as a way to achieve that result
 but may not continue in the future. As a result
the value of the Company&rsquo;s securities
 and the value of cryptocurrencies generally may be more likely to fluctuate due to
changing investor confidence in future appreciation (or depreciation) in market prices
 profits from related or unrelated investments
or holdings of cryptocurrency. Such factors or events would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all
 or on the price of the Company&rsquo;s securities
 which would have a material
adverse effect on the business
 prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company
holds or expects to acquire for its own account.

It
may become illegal in the future to acquire
 own
 hold
 sell or use cryptocurrencies
 participate in the Blockchain or utilize
similar digital assets in one or more countries
 the ruling of which would adversely affect the Company.

Although
currently cryptocurrencies
 the Blockchain and digital assets generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries
including the United States
 one or more countries may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the
right to acquire
 own
 hold
 sell or use these digital assets or to exchange for fiat currency. Such restrictions may adversely
affect the Company. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern or to pursuing this segment at all
 which would have a material adverse effect on the business
 prospects or operations
of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account and
harm investors.&nbsp;

The
markets for Blockchain/cryptocurrency based assets may be illiquid
 and may be subject to manipulation.

Digital
assets that are represented and trade on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock
exchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers
 requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules and
monitoring investors transacting on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated
on a distributed ledger platform
 depending on the platform&rsquo;s controls and other policies. The more lenient a distributed
ledger platform is about vetting issuers of digital assets or users that transact on the platform
 the higher the potential risk
for fraud or the manipulation of digital assets. These factors may decrease liquidity or volume
 or increase volatility of digital
securities or other assets trading on a ledger-based system
 which may adversely affect the Company. Such circumstances would
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all
which would have a material adverse effect on the business
 prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of
any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account and harm investors.



    
    


Risks
Related to LIBB&rsquo;s Beverage Business

We
operate in highly competitive markets
 which could negatively affect our sales.

Our
industry is highly competitive. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources
 including Dr.
Pepper Snapple Group
 Inc. and Arizona Beverage Company. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond
to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products
 reducing prices or increasing promotional
activities. We also compete against a variety of smaller
 regional and private label manufacturers. Smaller companies may be more
innovative
 better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. Our inability
to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales. We are subject to competition from companies
 including from some
of our customers
 that either currently manufacture or are developing products directly in competition with our products. These
generic or store-branded products may be a less expensive option for consumers than our products making it more difficult to sell
our product. As a result
 we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing
 advertising and product innovation.
Any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance.

We
may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences
 trends
 health concerns and other factors. If we do not effectively
anticipate these trends
 then quickly develop new products
 our sales could suffer.

Consumers&rsquo;
preferences can change due to a variety of factors
 including aging of the population
 social trends
 negative publicity
 economic
downturn or other factors. If we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences
 then quickly develop
new products in response
 our sales could suffer. Developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive. We may not
be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences
 and some of our competitors may be better able to respond
to these changes
 either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.

Costs
for our raw materials may increase substantially
 which could negatively affect our financial performance.

The
principal raw materials we use in our business are bottles
 caps
 labels
 packaging materials
 tea essence and tea base
 sugar
natural flavors and other sweeteners
 juice
 electricity
 fuel and water. The cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially.
We may not be able to pass along any increases in such costs to our customers or consumers
 which could negatively affect our
business and financial performance. We presently do not mitigate our exposure to volatility in the prices of raw materials through
the use of forward contracts
 pricing agreements or other hedging arrangements.

Certain
raw materials we use are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In the event our suppliers are unable or unwilling
to meet our requirements
 we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases.

Most
of the raw materials we use are available from only a few suppliers. If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements
we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases. Changing suppliers can require long lead times. The failure of our suppliers
to meet our needs could occur for many reasons
 including fires
 natural disasters
 weather
 manufacturing problems
 disease
crop failure
 strikes
 transportation interruption
 government regulation
 political instability and terrorism. A failure of supply
could also occur due to suppliers&rsquo; financial difficulties
 including bankruptcy. Any significant interruption to supply
or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance.

Substantial
disruption to production at our third party beverage co-packing facilities and our storage facilities could occur
 which could
disrupt or delay our production or cause us to incur substantially higher costs.

Our
products are currently produced by three established co-packing companies. A disruption in our production at
 or our relationships
with
 our third party beverage co-packing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition
 a disruption
could occur at any of our storage facilities or those of our suppliers
 co-packers or distributors. The disruption could occur
for many reasons
 including fire
 natural disasters
 weather
 manufacturing problems
 disease
 strikes
 transportation interruption
government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available
 may
cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production
 each of which could negatively affect our business
and financial performance.


    
    


We
rely
 in part
 on our third party beverage co-packing facilities to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability
of this co-manufacturer to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product recall and
could adversely affect our reputation.

We
take great care in ensuring the quality and safety in the manufacture of our products. Our third-party co-manufacturer is required
to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications and requirements for certain certifications.
Our third-party co-manufacturer is also required to comply with Food and Drug Administration requirements for manufacturing of
our product. However
 our products could still otherwise become contaminated. A contamination could occur in our operations or
those of our bottlers
 distributors or suppliers. This could result in expensive production interruptions
 recalls and liability
claims. Moreover
 negative publicity could be generated from false
 unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls.
Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.

We
may be subject to litigation. The cost of defending against such litigation and the negative publicity related to such litigation
may adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

From
time to time in the normal course of our business operations
 we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability
or negatively affect our operating results. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion
of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception
of our business
 regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result
 litigation
may adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. For more information
 see the item &ldquo;Legal
Proceedings&rdquo; in the Annual Report and Quarterly Reports.

Fluctuations
in our results of operations from quarter to quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and
results of operations.

We
experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income. Historically
 sales during the second and third fiscal quarters
have generally been the highest. Any factors that harm our second or third quarter operating results
 including adverse weather
or unfavorable economic conditions
 could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.
Unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our
business and financial performance.

In
order to prepare for our peak selling season
 we must produce and keep in stock more inventory than we would carry at other times
of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak selling season could require us to sell excess
inventory at a substantial markdown
 which could reduce our net sales and gross profit.

A
deterioration of global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry
 business and results of operations.

Disruptions
in the global credit and financial markets and in economic conditions generally may include diminished liquidity and credit availability
a decline in consumer confidence
 a decline in economic growth
 an increased unemployment rate and uncertainty about economic
stability. Such disruptions may affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways
 making it difficult to accurately forecast
and plan our future business activities. Any adverse global economic conditions and tightening of credit in financial markets
may lead consumers to postpone spending
 which may cause our customers to cancel
 decrease or delay their existing and future
orders with us. In addition
 financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers
 manufacturers
 distributors or customers could
result in product delays
 increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. We are unable to predict the likely
duration and severity of disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions.

Our
sales growth is dependent upon maintaining our relationships with existing distributors and retailers and the loss of any one
such distributor or retailer could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Certain
retailers that we service primarily through our distributors make up a significant percentage of our products&rsquo; retail volume
including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. We also sell directly to certain retail accounts and to the distribution
facilities of such retailers. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands.
For the year ended December 31
 2017
 two customers
 Garden Foods and Big Geyser accounted for 25% and 14% of our net sales
 respectively.
For the year ended December 31
 2016
 two customers
 Seba Distribution LLC and Garden Foods accounted for 20% and 11% of our net
sales
 respectively. The loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our
business and financial performance.


    
    


Food
and beverage retailers in the U.S. have been consolidating which may reduce our ability to increase both our revenue and our gross
margins.

Consolidation
has resulted in large
 sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist our price
increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger
 more tailored promotional and product
delivery programs. If we
 and our bottlers and distributors
 do not successfully provide appropriate marketing
 product
 packaging
pricing and service to these retailers
 our product availability
 sales and margins could suffer.

We
do not have any contracts with our customers that require the purchase of a minimum amount of our products. The absence of such
contracts could result in periods during which we must continue to pay costs and service indebtedness with reduced sales.

Our
customers do not provide us with firm
 long-term or short-term volume purchase commitments. As a result of the absence of such
contracts
 we could have periods during which we have no or limited orders for our products
 but we will continue to have to pay
our costs
 including those to maintain our work force and service our indebtedness with reduced sales. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to timely find new customers to supplement periods where we experience no or limited purchase orders or that we
can recover fixed costs as a result of experiencing reduced purchase orders. Periods of no or limited purchase orders for our
products could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cause us to incur losses. Conversely
 we may experience unanticipated
increased orders for our products from these customers that can create supply chain problems and may result in orders we may be
unable to meet. Unanticipated fluctuations in product requirements by our customers could result in fluctuations in our results
from quarter to quarter.

We
have developed a gallon product line in which our gross margins are minimal
 and therefore may not generate sufficient revenues
or other benefits to justify its introduction. In addition
 the gallon product line may divert sales from our higher margin 18oz
product line
 which would adversely affect our business.

In
May 2015
 we developed a gallon product line featuring five of our existing flavors. Our gross margins on this product line are
minimal. Accordingly
 this product line may not generate sufficient revenues or other benefits to justify its introduction. In
addition
 to the extent distributors choose to carry the gallon product line instead of our higher margin 18oz product line
 it
may negatively affect our operating results
 specifically our gross margin. Although we believe the gallon size has a different
function and manner of consumption
 consumers may choose to purchase the gallon size instead of the 18oz size
 because the gallon
size offers a better per ounce value. This would result in an overall lower gross margin for our business.

We
do not have registered ownership of certain of our trade names and our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could
infringe the intellectual property rights of others
 and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property
 including termination
of distribution rights
 could harm our business.

We
possess intellectual property that is important to our business. This intellectual property includes our logo
 trademarks for
&ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand
&rdquo; various other trademarks
 copyrights
 patents
ingredient formulas
 business processes and other trade secrets. However
 we do not currently have registered ownership of the
trademark &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; and do not have registered ownership on the principal register of the trademark
&ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; as described below. We and third parties
 including competitors
 could come into conflict over
intellectual property rights. Litigation could disrupt our business
 divert management attention and cost a substantial amount
to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will
be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. Our business is also highly dependent upon our distribution
rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights
 including the right to our trade name and logo
 our brands
products and business could be harmed and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

On
April 19
 2016
 the United States Patent and Trademark Officer
 or the &ldquo;USPTO
&rdquo; registered our mark &ldquo;Long Island
Iced Tea&rdquo; (Registration No. 4
943
056) on the supplemental register. Registration on the supplemental register allows the
use of the &ldquo;&reg;&rdquo; symbol
 blocks later filed applications for confusingly similar marks
 and allows us to sue infringers
in federal court
 which has well-settled case law and standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 the supplemental register does
not provide all the protection of a registration on the principal register. As with any other registered mark
 we may be open
to claims of others contesting the trademark.


    
    


In
addition
 we have filed trademark applications for &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; as a standard character mark and
as a stylized mark
 which applications are pending review by the USPTO. The applications are for use of the trademarks with iced
tea
 tea based products
 juices
 water
 beverages and other similar products. We also plan to file for stylized marks protecting
certain other tag lines and product designs. With respect to the pending trademark applications for &ldquo;The Original Long Island
Brand&rdquo; (standard character mark and stylized mark)
 the USPTO has made an initial determination that both marks are geographically
descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded us the opportunity to produce evidence to establish that
the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce. There can be no assurance that the USPTO will approve these applications.

If
we incur substantial debt
 it could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.

As
of December 31
 2017
 we had $742
113 of total indebtedness
 consisting of auto and vending loans and a bridge financing agreement.
The bridge financing agreement ($688
038) is to be repaid based upon 15% of our future receipts. In December 2017
 we entered
into a Loan and Option Agreement (the &ldquo;Facility&rdquo;) in which a borrowing facility of an aggregate of $2
000
000 was
made available
 with the option to increase this amount to $4
000
000 with the consent of the lender. In connection with the Facility
on December 22
 2017
 we received an initial drawdown of $750
000. The Company paid a $100
000 facility fee upon execution. On
December 26
 2017
 the $750
000 initial drawdown and accrued interest was converted by the lender into 250
233 shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock. In January 2018
 the Company drew an additional $1
250
000 under the Facility. While our existing level of debt
is not substantial and we will pay interest that accrues on these obligations
 we may incur significant indebtedness in the future
and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service such debt as cash payments become due. If new debt and/or new credit
sources are added to our existing debt and credit sources
 the related risks for us could intensify.

If
we incur substantial debt
 it could have important consequences. In particular
 it could:



    
    
require
    us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness
 thereby reducing the
    availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

    
    
    

    
    
limit
    along with the restrictive covenants of our indebtedness
 among other things
 our ability to borrow additional funds;

    
    
    

    
    
limit
    our flexibility in planning for
 or reacting to
 changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

    
    
    

    
    
increase
    our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and

    
    
    

    
    
place
    us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.


In
addition
 if we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing
our indebtedness
 there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event
 or if we are otherwise in default
under one or more of such agreements
 including pursuant to any cross-default provisions of such agreements
 the lenders could
terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Furthermore
they could foreclose on their security interests in our assets
 including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries. If
any of those events occur
 our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may
be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing
 it might not be on terms that are favorable
or acceptable to us. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity
and financial position.

The
loss of the services of our key personnel could negatively affect our business
 as could our inability to attract and retain qualified
management
 sales and technical personnel as and when needed.


The
execution of our business strategy depends largely on the continued efforts of Philip Thomas. On February 20
 2018
 Mr. Thomas
(co-founder of LIBB) resigned as our Chief Executive Officer. Under the direction of a special beverage committee of the Board
Mr. Thomas is expected to lead the beverage business until after the Spinoff. As we have a limited operating history
 we are highly
dependent upon this individuals&rsquo; knowledge
 experience and reputation within the industry. We cannot be assured of how long
or under what conditions Mr. Thomas will continue to look after the beverage business. If Mr. Thomas were to stop looking after
the beverage business
 we may not be able to find adequate replacements for him. Without his experience
 expertise and reputation
our development efforts and future prospects would be substantially impaired.



    
    


We
may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations
 and they could change. Any violations could result in reputational
damage or substantial penalties
 and any changes could result in increased compliance costs.

We
are subject to a variety of federal
 state and local laws and regulations in the U.S.
 and other countries in which we do business.
These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture
 safety
 labeling
 transportation
advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory
actions with substantial penalties. In addition
 any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation
 or
the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital
expenditures. For example
 changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase
our costs. Regulatory focus on the health
 safety and marketing of food products is increasing. Certain state warning and labeling
laws
 such as California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prop 65
&rdquo; which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state
lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects
 could become applicable to our products. Some local and regional governments
and school boards have enacted
 or have proposed to enact
 regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in
schools. Any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability
 or disrupt the production
or distribution of our products
 and negatively affect our business and financial performance.

Further
growth into our &lsquo;better-for-you&rsquo; brand portfolio may
 in part
 result from merger
 acquisition
 distribution or licensing
agreements that require greater capability of management to effectively administer this growth and may have greater inherent risk.

We
are constantly looking to grow our business through potential mergers
 acquisitions
 distribution agreements or licensing agreements.
However
 we may not be able to identify suitable candidates
 obtain the capital necessary to pursue our strategy or have the agreements
be on satisfactory terms. We will likely experience significant competition in our effort to execute a strategy as a number of
competitors have also adopted a strategy of expanding and diversifying through acquisitions
 mergers
 distribution or licensing
agreements. As a result
 we may be unable to continue to further our growth strategy or may be forced to pay more for the growth
than we would otherwise want to pay. When growth occurs
 we may not be able to integrate or manage these businesses to produce
returns that justify the investment. Any difficulty in successfully integrating or managing the operations of such growth could
have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity
 and could
lead to a failure to realize any anticipated synergies. Our management also will be required to dedicate substantial time and
effort to the integration of any mergers
 acquisitions
 distribution or licensing agreements. These efforts could divert management&rsquo;s
focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters.

Risks
Related to Our Businesses

Our
ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available to us or not available
on terms favorable to us.

Historically
our cash generated from operations has not been sufficient to meet our expenses. We have financed our operations principally through
the raising of equity capital
 debt and through trade credit with our vendors. Our ability to continue our operations and to pay
our obligations when they become due is contingent upon obtaining additional financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
amounts of additional capital
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned market development activities
 and/or consider
reductions in personnel costs or other operating costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern.

We
have a limited operating history and history of operating losses
 and there is no guarantee that we will achieve profitability.

We
have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses. There is no guarantee that we will become a profitable business.
Further
 our future operating results depend upon a number of factors
 including our ability to manage our growth
 retain our
customer base and to successfully identify and respond to emerging trends in our market areas.

Risks
Related an Investment in Our Common Stock

The
                                         Spinoff may have negative consequences.

As
indicated herein
 our board of directors approved management&rsquo;s intentions to effectuate the Spinoff of LIBB. The Spinoff
is intended to allow us to focus exclusively on our move into the Blockchain technology industry.&nbsp; However
 the Spinoff may
have negative consequences to it.&nbsp; For instance
 the actions required to separate LIBB from our company could disrupt both
company&rsquo;s operations.&nbsp; Further
 we will incur costs in connection with the Spinoff that would not be incurred if LIBB
were to continue as a subsidiary of ours.

We
do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

We
have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date. Any future decisions regarding dividends will be made by our board
of directors. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future
 but expect to retain earnings to finance the growth
of our business. Therefore
 any return on investments will only occur if the market price of our common stock appreciates.


    
    


A
robust public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained
 which could affect your ability to sell our common
stock or depress the market price of our common stock.

Effective
April 12
 2018
 our common stock is traded and quoted on the Pink Current Information tier operated by the OTC. We are unable
to predict whether an active trading market for our common stock will develop or will be sustained. Because our common stock is
not listed on a national securities exchange
 we may be subject to the following significant material adverse consequences
 including:




    
    
a
    limited availability of market quotations for our securities;

    
    
    

    
    
reduced
    liquidity with respect to our securities;

    
    
    

    
    
a
    determination that our shares of common stock are &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; which will require brokers trading in our shares
    of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules
 possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary
    trading market for our shares of common stock;

    
    
    

    
    
a
    limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and

    
    
    

    
    
a
    decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.


The
trading price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.

The
price and volume of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Our stock has traded at a low of $1.70 to a
high of $12.55 since January 1
 2016
 and the current stock price is $1.96 as of April 9
 2018. Some of the factors
that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include:




    
    
general
    market and economic conditions and market trends
 including in the beverage industry and the financial markets generally;

    
    
    

    
    
the
    political
 economic and social situation in the U.S.;

    
    
    

    
    
actual
    or expected variations in operating results;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions
 strategic partnerships
 joint ventures
 capital commitments
 or other
    business developments;

    
    
    

    
    
adoption
    of new accounting standards affecting the industry in which we operate;



    
    




    
    
operations
    and stock performance of competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
litigation
    or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;

    
    
    

    
    
recruitment
    or departure of key personnel;

    
    
    

    
    
purchase
    or sales of blocks of our common stock; and

    
    
    

    
    
operating
    and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.


There
can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent
years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
performance of individual companies and that could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock
 regardless of our
operating performance. You should also be aware that price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our common
stock is low
 as it historically has been.

Our
outstanding warrants and options will increase the number of shares outstanding and available for sale in the public markets
which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

We
presently have outstanding (i) stock options to purchase 500
034 shares of common stock at exercise prices of between $3.23 and
$5.00 per share held by certain of our executive officers
 directors and employees and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 1
369
320
shares of common stock at exercise prices of between $2.40 and $6.875 per share. If and to the extent these warrants and options
are exercised
 you may experience dilution to your holdings and/or it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common
stock. The market price of our common stock also may be adversely affected
 if and to the extent the shares registered for resale
pursuant to this prospectus are sold in the public markets.

The
substantial number of shares that are eligible for sale pursuant to our resale registration statement could cause the market price
for our common stock to decline or make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future.

We
have an effective registration statement registering the resale by certain of our stockholders of up to 4
348
889 shares of our
common stock. Expectations that shares of our common stock may be sold by the selling stockholders could create an &ldquo;overhang&rdquo;
that may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.

We
cannot predict the effect on the market price of our common stock from time to time as a result of (i) sales by the stockholders
of some or all of the 4
348
889 shares of our common stock under our resale registration statement
 (ii) the availability of such
shares of common stock for sale by the selling stockholders
 or (iii) the perception that such shares may be offered for sale
by the selling stockholders. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market
 or the perception
that those sales will occur
 could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or make future offerings of our equity
securities more difficult. Any sale
 or perceived impending sale
 of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could
cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.

We
have the ability to issue additional shares of common stock and &ldquo;blank check&rdquo; preferred stock
 which could affect
the rights of holders of the common stock.


Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue 35
000
000 shares of common stock and
1
000
000 shares of preferred stock and to set the terms of such preferred stock. We have 19
243
900 authorized but unissued
shares of common stock available for issuance after appropriate reservation for our outstanding options and warrants (excluding
any warrants that may be issued to the investors in this offering). The issuance of additional common stock may dilute the economic
and voting rights of our existing stockholders. In addition
 the terms of such preferred stock may materially adversely impact
the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of the common stock.


Provisions
in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us
 which could limit the
price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.

Our
charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best
interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the
terms of and issue new series of preferred stock. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law
 which could
delay or prevent a change of control. Together
 these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage
transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.


    
    


Our
senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully manage a publicly traded company.

Not
all of our senior executive officers or directors have extensive experience managing a publicly traded company
 and they may not
be successful in doing so. The demands of managing a publicly traded company
 like ours
 is much greater as compared to those
of a private company
 and some of our senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully meet those increased
demands.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging
growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (&ldquo;JOBS Act&rdquo;)
and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies.
These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (&ldquo;Sarbanes-Oxley&rdquo;)
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports
and proxy statements
 and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and
stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive
because we rely
 or may rely
 on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result
 the price
of our common stock may be reduced
 there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common
stock may be more volatile.

In
addition
 under the JOBS Act
 &ldquo;emerging growth companies&rdquo; can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until
such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption
from new or revised accounting standards and
 therefore
 we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as
other public companies that are not &ldquo;emerging growth companies.&rdquo;

We
could remain an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; until December 31
 2020
 although a variety of circumstances could cause
us to lose that status earlier. For as long as we take advantage of the reduced reporting obligations
 the information that we
provide stockholders may be different from information provided by other public companies.

Obligations
associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention
 which may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We
are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 or the &ldquo;Exchange Act
&rdquo;
and the other rules and regulations of the SEC
 including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires
 among other things
that we file annual
 quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act requires
 among other things
 that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management
 administrative
 operational and
accounting resources
 make certain activities more time-consuming and cause us to incur significant legal
 accounting and other
expenses. In order to comply with these obligations
 we may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems
 implement additional
financial and management controls
 reporting systems and procedures
 expand or outsource our internal audit function
 and hire
additional accounting and finance staff. Because our resources are limited compared to many public companies
 these requirement
may impose a disproportionate financial burden on us. Furthermore
 our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties
in complying with these reporting and other requirements and prevent us from focusing on executing our business strategy. In addition
if we are unable to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies
 the market
price of our common stock could be adversely affected.

As
an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and a &ldquo;smaller reporting company&rdquo; we intend to continue to take advantage
of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &ldquo;emerging
growth companies&rdquo; or &ldquo;smaller reporting companies
&rdquo; including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply
with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and other scaled disclosure requirements
 and exemptions from the requirements
of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not
previously approved. In general
 we will remain an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; until December 31
 2020
 although a variety
of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier
 and will remain a &ldquo;smaller reporting company&rdquo; for each
fiscal year where our public float remains below $75 million as of the last day of the second fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal
year. We intend to take advantage of some or all of these exemptions and reduced reporting requirements until we are no longer
an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and/or a &ldquo;smaller reporting company
&rdquo; at which time
 we expect to incur significant
additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with these additional requirements.

are in good condition and suitable to conduct our business.

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We
are involved in various claims and legal actions arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion
of our management
 the ultimate disposition of these matters in the ordinary course of business will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.

In
addition
 we are involved in the following legal action:

Revolution
Marketing
 LLC

On
August 1
 2014
 an action was filed by LIBB in the Supreme Court in the State of New York entitled Long Island Brand Beverages
LLC v. Revolution Marketing
 LLC (&ldquo;Revolution&rdquo;) and Ascent Talent
 Model Promotion Ltd. LIBB is seeking damages of
$10
000
000 for several claims including breach of contract and fraud occurring during 2014. Revolution has filed a counterclaim
for breach of contract and related causes of action
 claiming damages in the sum of $310
880
 and seeking punitive damages of
$5
000
000. Ascent has filed a pre-answer motion to dismiss our complaint. We filed papers in opposition and the motion was submitted
by March 9
 2015. In addition
 Revolution has filed a motion to amend its answer to include cross-claims against Ascent which
were not asserted in its original answer of record. On February 5
 2016
 the Court rendered a decision. The motion to dismiss
was denied with the exception of two claims which the Court dismissed. In the same decision
 the Court granted a separate motion
filed by Revolution to amend its answer to include cross-claims against Ascent. On June 23
 2017
 both defendants filed motions
to dismiss based upon delays in producing documents
 which were fully submitted. On August 7
 2017
 oral arguments were held.
Thereafter
 the court denied the motions to dismiss and each of the parties has completed their discovery. On October 6

he claims were agreed to by us. Our management and legal counsel believe it is too early to determine the probable outcome of
this matter.

MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Executive
Summary



Until
December 2017
 we were focused exclusively on the ready-to-drink segment of the beverage industry. In December 2017
 we announced
that we were shifting our primary corporate focus towards the exploration of
 and investment in
 opportunities that leverage the
benefits of Blockchain technology. In connection with the shift in strategic direction
 we changed our name from &ldquo;Long Island
Iced Tea Corp.&rdquo; to &ldquo;Long Blockchain Corp.&rdquo; and reserved the web domain www.longblockchain.com. We also changed
our trading symbol from &ldquo;LTEA&rdquo; to &ldquo;LBCC&rdquo; in connection with the name change.

Blockchain
Business

We
are seeking to become a full service Blockchain technology company. Our aim is to provide products and services to contribute
and generate revenues from all aspects of the Blockchain Eco-System
 including Digital trading (such as operating an exchange)
Facilitation of Digital Currency Storage (Crypto wallets)
 Capital raising activities (such ICO&rsquo;s) or DLT-based initiatives
(Smart KYC). As a public company
 we believe that we are in a prime position to build and acquire technology with global applications
using Blockchain technology.


As
our first step to becoming a full service Blockchain technology company
 we entered into the Hashcove Agreement in March
2018. Pursuant to the Hashcove Agreement
 we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hashcove from the Hashcove Shareholders
and Hashcove will become our wholly owned subsidiary. Closing of the transaction
 which is expected to occur by the third quarter
of 2018
 is subject to customary closing conditions
 including among others that neither we nor Hashcove suffers a material adverse
effect as outlined in the agreement.

Hashcove
is an early stage UK-based technology company focused on developing and deploying globally scalable distributed ledger technology
solutions. Among its planned product offerings
 Hashcove is developing tokenized platforms
 crypto-exchanges and wallets
 smart
contracts for ICOs
 KYC and financial clearing technology on blockchain
 and other related blockchain applications. Hashcove&rsquo;s
product team includes 25 employees
 including developers
 with proven experience in enterprise financial trading algorithmic software.

Hashcove
would provide us with in-house expertise in a number of Blockchain products and strategic leadership as to Blockchain/DLT product
development and delivery. We believe moving in this direction will enable us to generate maximum revenue while maintaining full
control over the intellectual property related to such technologies. Assuming consummation of the transaction with Hashcove
 we
intend to seek to build decentralized Blockchain applications for clients around the globe
 across industries
 for uses varying
from peer-to-peer lending
 healthcare and education. The opportunities could include developing Blockchain applications on various
Blockchains platforms including Ethereum and EOS. We would also look to leverage the core capability of Hashcove to build its
other planned products including Crypto wallet
 Crypto exchange
 ICO Smart contracts and KYC / Clearing on Blockchain.

Following
our acquisition of Hashcove
 we will look to expand our business to allow for the generation of end-client acquisitions and formulate
a solid distribution model. This will be driven by our recent minority investments in SBL and TSLC. SBL focuses on developing
and deploying globally scalable blockchain technology solutions in the financial markets. SBL&rsquo;s wholly-owned subsidiary
SGM
 is a FCA-regulated brokerage that facilitates market access across multiple instruments including spot FX
 exchange traded
futures and CFDs. TSLC is the parent company of CASHe
 a leading provider of digital money and short-term financial products to
young millennials across India. TSLC also owns all of the intellectual property developed by CASHe and has the worldwide rights
outside of India to the application of its intellectual property for its lending and money transfer platform. We will seek to
leverage our investment in SBL to help Hashcove cross market and diversify its products and offerings and will seek to leverage
our investment in TSLC to diversity our distribution base for Blockchain-based products. SBL and TSLC offer us entry ways to very
different segments of the financial services market but that still have a need for Blockchain-based products. We believe this
will allow Hashcove&rsquo;s technology to service the full spectrum of customer segments and hopefully lead to additional avenues
for its products.



    
    


Beverage
Business

We
intend to continue to operate LIBB as a wholly-owned subsidiary until we complete the Spinoff and maintain the focus of
this business on the ready-to-drink segment of the beverage industry
 specifically
 premium
 &lsquo;better-for-you&rsquo; brands
marketed at an affordable price. Through LIBB
 we are engaged in the production and distribution of premium Non-Alcoholic Ready-to-Drink
or &ldquo;NARTD
&rdquo; beverages. Our beverage business is currently organized around our flagship iced tea product
 under the
brand Long Island Iced Tea&reg;. The Long Island Iced Tea name for a cocktail originated in Long Island in the 1970&rsquo;s
 and
its national recognition is such that it is ranked as the fourth most popular cocktail in restaurants and bars in the U.S. (Source:
Nielsen CGA
 On-Premise Consumer Survey
 2016). Our premium NARTD tea is made from a proprietary recipe and with quality components.
Long Island Iced Tea&reg; is sold in 27 states across the U.S.
 primarily on the East Coast
 through a network of national and
regional retail chains and distributors.

We
also sell The Original Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade
 which is a NARTD functional beverage made from a proprietary recipe
with quality components. Since February 2016
 we have also been engaged in the aloe juice business
 under the brand ALO Juice.
ALO Juice is a NARTD functional beverage made from juice derived from the aloe plant known as aloe vera. ALO Juice sources its
aloe plants from harvests in Thailand. The plants are exported from there to South Korea where they are processed in a unique
whole leaf manner to ensure the nutritional and health benefits are maintained from the plant all the way through to the bottling
process.

The
mission of our beverage business is to provide consumers with &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo; premium beverages offered at an affordable
price.

Corporate
History

We
were incorporated under the name &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rdquo; on December 23
 2014 in the State of Delaware. On December
21
 2017
 we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our name from &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rdquo; to &ldquo;Long
Blockchain Corp.&rdquo;

Our
principal executive offices are located at 12-1 Dubon Court
 Farmingdale
 New York 11735. Our telephone number is (855) 542-2832.
Our website addresses are www.longblockchain.com and www.longislandicedtea.com. The information contained on
 or accessible from
our corporate websites are not part of this annual report and you should not consider information contained on our websites to
be a part of this annual report or in deciding whether to purchase our common stock.



We
generate income through the sale of our NARTD beverage. The following are highlights of our operating results for the years ended
December 31
 2017 and 2016:



    
    
Net
    sales
 2017
 we had net sales of $4
434
465
 representing an decrease of $123
565 over
    the year ended December 31
 2016. The decrease is due to the slow movement of our Alo products
 which had $505
419 less net
    sales in the year ended December 31
 2017
 and lower sales of our gallon products by $272
661. The decrease was partially
    off-set by the introduction of our new line of lemonade products
 which had net sales of $710
725 for the year ended December
    31
 2017.

    
    
    

    
    
.
    Our margin decreased by 155% for the year ended December 31
 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31
 2016. The primary
    reason for the decreased margins during the year ended December was the shift from our 20 oz product to the 18 oz product
    in the spring of 2017
 for which we offered larger discounts for
 as it was a new product. The discounts include the issuance
    sales warrants to Big Geyser. The discounts resulted in a decrease to our margins of $271
713. As a result
 during the year
    ended December 31
 2017 our margin on the sale of iced tea was $(69
226) as compared to a margin of $311
447 for the year
    ended December 31
 2016.



    
    




    
    
Operating
    expenses
 2017
 our operating expenses were $13
940
064
 an increase of $5
832
278
    as compared to the year ended December 31
 2016. The increases in operating expenses for the year ended December 31
 2017
    related primarily to increased staffing costs as we continued to build out our organization
 legal
 accounting and consulting
    costs incurred for the exploration into blockchain
 and an increase in investor relations and in advertising costs.


Historically
our cash generated from operations has not been sufficient to meet our expenses. During 2017
 we have most significantly financed
our business through the sale of equity interests. During the year ended December 31
 2017
 our cash flows used in operations
were $9
392
304
 our net cash provided by investing activities was $2
426
069
 and our net cash provided by financing activities
was $6
087
632. We had a working capital deficit of $712
310 as of December 31
 2017.

In
order to execute our long-term growth strategy
 we expect to continue to raise additional funds through equity offerings
 debt
financings
 or other means. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise such funds on acceptable terms or at all.

Uncertainties
and Trends in Our Business

We
believe that the key uncertainties and trends in our business are as follows:




    
    
We
    recently announced that we were expanding our attention to include the exploration of
 and investment in
 opportunities
    that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology
 and therefore have an extremely limited operating history in the blockchain
    area. We have not generated any revenues to date from the blockchain business.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    blockchain industry is rapidly changing.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    operate in highly competitive markets.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences
 trends and other factors.

    
    
    

    
    
Costs
    for raw materials that are used in our beverage business may increase substantially.

    
    
    

    
    
Fluctuations
    in our results of operations from quarter to quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition
    and results of operations.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our beverage sales.

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others
 and adverse
    events regarding licensed intellectual property
 including termination of distribution rights
 could harm our business.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    have experienced cash losses from operations and our ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected
    if adequate capital is not available to us.

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    new beverage product line has minimal gross margins
 may not generate sufficient revenue or other benefits to justify its
    introduction and may divert sales from our higher margin existing product lines.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    have a limited operating history.



Critical
Accounting Policies

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities
 revenues and expenses
 and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in these consolidated financial statements. We believe that
 of our significant
accounting policies (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K)
 the following policies are
the most critical.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue
is stated net of sales discounts and rebates paid to customers. Net sales are recognized when all of the following conditions
are met: (1) the price is fixed and determined; (2) evidence of a binding arrangement exists (generally
 purchase orders); (3)
products have been delivered and there is no future performance required; and (4) amounts are collectible under normal payment
terms. These conditions typically occur when the products are delivered to or picked up by our customers. For sales where certain
revenue recognition criteria have not been met at the date of delivery
 we defer recognition of such revenue until such recognition
criteria are met.


    
    


Customer
Marketing Programs and Sales Incentives

The
Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of its products. Among
these programs are arrangements under which allowances can be earned by customers for attaining agreed upon sales levels or for
participating in specific marketing programs. The Company believes that its participation in these programs is essential to ensuring
volume and revenue growth in a competitive marketplace. The costs of all these various programs are recorded as a reduction of
sales in the consolidated financial statements.

Additionally
the Company may be required to occasionally pay fees to its customers (&ldquo;Placement Fees&rdquo;) in order to place its products
in the customers&rsquo; stores. In most cases
 the Placement Fees carry no further benefit or minimum revenue guarantee other
than the right to place the Company&rsquo;s product in the customers&rsquo; stores. The Placement Fees are recorded as a reduction
of sales. If
 at the time the Placement Fees are recognized in the statement of operations
 the Company has cumulative negative
sales with that particular customer
 such negative sales are reclassified and recorded as a part of selling and marketing expense.

Accounts
Receivable

The
Company sells products to distributors and in certain cases directly to retailers
 and extends credit
 generally without requiring
collateral
 based on its evaluation of the customer&rsquo;s financial condition. Potential losses on the Company&rsquo;s receivables
are dependent on each individual customer&rsquo;s financial condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date.
The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically
 accounts receivable have terms of net 30
days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential
losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its
history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the
Company&rsquo;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. Accounts receivable are stated at the amounts management
expects to collect. For sales where certain revenue recognition criteria have not been met at the date of delivery
 the Company
defers recognition of such accounts receivable until such recognition criteria are met.



The
Company&rsquo;s inventory includes raw materials such as bottles
 sweeteners
 labels
 flavors and packaging. Finished goods inventory
consists of bottled and packaged iced tea and ALO Juice. The Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost is determined using the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method. Included in inventory at December 31
 2017 was finished
goods inventory with a cost of approximately $201
000 that was delivered to a distributor
 and is held in inventory until such
revenue recognition criteria are met.

Net
Sales and Gross Profit

Net
sales for the year ended December 31
 2017 decreased by $123
565
 or 3%
 to $4
434
465 as compared to $4
558
030 for the year
ended December 31
 2016. The decrease is due to a combination of a decrease in Alo sales
 and greater rebates given for the introduction
of our lemonade and 18oz iced tea product lines. During the year ended December 31
 2017
 our iced tea product distribution expanded
into 11 additional states and into over 1
000 new retail outlets. This expansion was driven by rebates offered on our products
principally $271
713 on non-cash sign-on incentives for warrants issued to Big Geyser
 and $158
929 for lemonade. Net sales of
our iced tea product in 18oz during the year ended December 31
 2017 increased by $3
875 and were $2
025
222 as compared to $2
021
347
for the year ended December 31
 2016. During the year ended December 31
 2017 our vending machine sales were $132
475 as compared
to $185
285 for the year ended December 31
 2016. During the second quarter of 2017
 we began selling a line of lemonade products
realizing year one revenues of $710
725. During 2017 there are no revenue derived from the blockchain business.

Gross
profit decreased by $493
425
 or 155%
 to $(174
712) for the year ended December 31
 2017 from $318
713 for the year ended December
31
 2016. Our gross profit percentage decreased to (3.9)% for the year ended December 31
 2017 as compared to 7.0% for the year
ended December 31
 2016. The decrease in gross profit percentage was due to (a) selling our gallon containers at or below costs
to certain distributors in order to acquire more shelf space and consumer visibility for the brand; (b) an increase in costs to
produce certain new package offerings for our 18oz product line; and (c) introductory pricing given to new customers on our 18oz
and lemonade product lines during the year ended December 31
 2017.

General
and administrative expenses

General
and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31
 2017 increased by $1
501
145
 or 30%
 to $6
459
221
as compared to $4
958
076 for the year ended December 31
 2016. This increase was principally the result of our efforts to
build out our management and support team to support our growth and enhance our corporate governance. Specifically
 we incurred
increased costs of approximately $784
819 in legal and consulting fees associated with potential acquisitions
 accounting
 travel
associated with relocating an executive from New Zealand
 and enhanced travel associated the expanding footprint of the beverage
business. We incurred increases in bad debt expense of $730
975 and personnel costs of $205
016. These were principally off-set
by a decrease in stock-based compensation costs of $330
221. The remainder of the cost increases are primarily related to costs
incurred in support of the expansion of the business
 including increases in rent and storage fees
 insurance costs
 website and
internet costs.


    
    


Selling
and marketing expenses

Selling
and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31
 2017 increased by $4
181
133
 or 133%
 to $7
330
843
as compared to $3
149
710 for the year ended December 31
 2016. The increase was principally the result of key management hires
to expand the capabilities of the sales and marketing organization
 strategic spending in support of brand and investor awareness
and increases in freight out and other costs consistent with the distribution growth. Specifically
 our personnel cost increased
by $842
158 in connection with the hiring of additional sales and marketing employees. We incurred an increase of $214
331 in
stock-based compensation costs and an increase of $798
605 in advertising expenses. Our brand awareness investor and public relations
costs increased by $1
254
655 due to new investor relations agreements and increased spending. We incurred an increase
of $166
697 in connection with our new product initiatives and ALO Juice development.

expense for the year ended December 31
 2017 decreased by $5

Historically
our cash generated from operations has not been sufficient to meet our expenses. We have financed our operations principally through
the raising of equity capital
 debt and through trade credit with our vendors. Our ability to continue our operations and to pay
our obligations when they become due is contingent upon obtaining additional financing.

To
date
 we have not generated any revenue from our Blockchain business. On March 15
 2018
 we entered into the Hashcove Agreement.
We are targeting to consummate the acquisition by the third quarter of 2018. Hashcove is not currently generating positive cash
flow and may not do so over the next twelve months as it continues to invest in the development of its Blockchain products.
We anticipate that funds from the ongoing operations of Hashcove will be insufficient to meet product research and development
efforts over the next twelve months
 and additional capital raises will be necessary in order to fund the ongoing research and
development efforts of Hashcove as well as any other Blockchain businesses that may be acquired by us. Management&rsquo;s
plans include raising additional funds through equity offerings
 debt financings
 or other means.



    
    


In
February 2018
 we announced the Spinoff. Currently
 the beverage business is running cash deficits. We will need to raise additional
capital to sustain the beverage business until the Spinoff. We believe that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital
to finance the planned operating activities of the beverage business through the date of the Spinoff
 although there are no assurances
that we will be able to raise such capital on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.


Through
the date of the Spinoff
 if we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital
 we may be required to reduce the
scope of our planned beverage and Blockchain market development activities
 and/or consider reductions in personnel costs
or other operating costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.
The consolidated financial statements filed do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.&nbsp;

Below
is a summary of our financing activities during the two years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016. In order to execute our strategy
of the Spinoff and expansion in the Blockchain technology space
 we will need to raise additional funds through private
equity offerings
 debt financings
 or other means. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise such funds on acceptable
terms or at all.

Financing
Activity


Magnum
Vending Corp 

On
November 23
 2015
 we entered into a reimbursement agreement with Magnum Vending Corp. (&ldquo;Magnum&rdquo;)
 an entity managed
by Philip Thomas
 our former Chief Executive Officer and director
 and certain of his family members. In exchange for the
exclusive right to stock vending machines owned by Magnum
 we agreed to reimburse Magnum for the cost of products to stock the
machines and the costs that Magnum incurred to acquire the machines including machines which were purchased with an equipment
loan. The total principal amount of the payments underlying the agreement upon inception was $117
917. The reimbursements will
be made in 35 monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $3
819 with an interest rate of 10%. Upon completion
of these payments in October 2018
 Magnum will transfer ownership of the vending machines to us. In addition
 in exchange for
the right to stock certain other vending machines that we have the right to use
 we agreed to purchase the products required to
be displayed in those vending machines from Magnum
 at a price equal to Magnum&rsquo;s cost for such products (See Note 13). We
may terminate the agreement and all obligations to make future payments on ten days&rsquo; written notice to Magnum. As of December
31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 the outstanding balance on the equipment loan was $36
495 and $76
474
 respectively.

Radium2
Capital Inc.


On
November 27
 2017
 we completed the Radium Agreement with Radium. Pursuant to the Radium Agreement
 we received cash of $750
000
less $7
500 of fees and expenses. The Radium borrowing is repaid at a minimum amount per week
 based upon 15% of our gross sales
until we had repaid a total of $986
250.The Agreement further provides for a discount on the repayment amount
 provided such prepay
obligation of $838
313 is paid within 126 business days from the date of funding. The Radium Agreement was accounted for as a
borrowing
 with the difference between the repayment obligation and the net amount funded being recorded as an original issue
discount
 and amortized using the interest method over the expected term of the arrangement. As of December 31
 2017
 the balance
of the obligation
 net of the discount was $688
038
 and was presented as note payable
 current
 within the consolidated financial
statements. During the year ended December 31
 2017
 accreted discount amortization was $47
437
 and was reflected as interest
expense within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Court
Cavendish Ltd.

On
December 20
 2017
 we entered into the Cavendish Loan Agreement with Cavendish. The Cavendish Loan Agreement provides for the
availability of the Facilities as long as we continue moving towards specific ventures related to the Blockchain
technology. Interest on the Facilities shall accrue monthly
 at a rate of 12.5% per annum
 on the unpaid principal balance commencing
on the date of the first drawdown and shall be due and payable
 without demand or notice
 at our election quarterly in cash or
in shares of our common stock valued at the lower of $3.00 or the closing price per share on the preceding date the interest payment
is due. All principal and accrued interest under the Facilities is due and payable on December 21
 2018. On such date
 at Cavendish&rsquo;s
election
 we shall repay the outstanding amount together with accrued interest either in cash or in shares of our common stock
at the lower of $3.00 or the closing price per share on such date
 but not lower than $2.00 per share. In connection with the
Cavendish Loan Agreement
 a 5% Original Issue Discount of each of the Initial Facility Amount and the Extended Facility Amount
is payable on the date of the first drawdown under each such facility and payable in either cash or stock. The facility fee on
the Initial Facility Amount of $100
000 was withheld from the proceeds of the initial $750
000 funding under the Cavendish Loan
Agreement.


In
connection with the Initial Facility Amount
 we issued to Cavendish a warrant to purchase 100
000 shares of our common stock with
a three year life and an exercise price of $3.00 per share. This warrant had a gross fair value of $165
645
 using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. Upon the first draw under the Extended Facility Amount
 we shall issue a warrant to purchase an additional
50
000 shares of our common stock
 with the same terms
 for each of the $1
000
000 extensions that are made available under the
Extended Facility Amount.

The
$100
000 fee and the warrant to issue 100
000 shares of our common stock were considered costs of the Initial Facility Amount.

For
the Initial Facility Amount
 the $100
000 fee was charged in full as a cost of the facility and the warrant was charged on a relative
fair value basis
 or in the amount of $152
362. These costs were initially charged to deferred financing costs
 since these costs
were associated with the Initial Facility Amount and not to a single funding. Thereafter
 these deferred costs shall be charged
on a pro rata basis as a direct offset against the fundings as they occur
 and such costs would be amortized using the interest
method over the term of each funding loan.

On
December 21
 2017
 we requested a funding of $750
000 under the Initial Financing Facility
 which was received by us on December
22
 2017. OID costs of $37
500 and warrant costs of $57
136
 were from deferred financing costs were directly offset against this
funding.

We
then evaluated the funding transaction to determine whether or not there was a beneficial conversion feature. Accordingly
 we
determined that after the effect of the OID and the warrant
 that the effective conversion price was $2.13 per share. With a market
price of our common stock on December 20
 2017
 of $2.44
 we were determined to have a beneficial conversion feature with a value
of $94
636. The beneficial conversion feature was accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital and a direct offset
to the funded loan amount
 with such costs amortized using the interest method over the term of each funding loan.

On
December 24
 2017
 Cavendish elected to convert the principal of $750
000 and accrued interest and thereupon was issued 250
233
shares
 based upon an exercise price of $3.00 per share. Accordingly
 in recording the conversion
 we recognized $189
272 in interest
expense for the unamortized debt discount and then the principal value of the note of $750
000 was credited to additional paid
in capital and common stock.


    
    


We
received an additional drawdown of $750
000 of the Initial Facility Amount on January 15
 2018. We received the final drawdown
of $500
000 of the Initial Facility Amount on January 30
 2018. Since we are no longer listed on NASDAQ (See Note 11)
 the
remaining amount under the Extended Facility Amount will not be available to us unless Cavendish were to waive this requirement.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE




ITEM
9A. CONTROL AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified under
the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed
to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer
 as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act
 our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and principal accounting officer)
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31
 2017. Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in paragraph (e) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) were not effective as December 31
 2017 due to a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below.


    
    


Limitations
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

An
internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
and presentation. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design
into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process used to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Internal control over financial
reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our board of
directors and management; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive)
we performed a complete documentation of the Company&rsquo;s significant processes and key controls
 and conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control&mdash;Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation
 management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31
 2017 due to the material weakness
described below.


A
material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined that our internal control of financial reporting had the following
material weakness:




    
    
The
    Company has insufficient qualified accounting and finance resources. Our internal control over these processes would not allow
    for employees to detect a material misstatement in these areas in the normal course of performing their duties.

    
    
    

    
    
Due
    to the small size of the Company
 the Company does not maintain sufficient segregation of duties to ensure the processing
    review and authorization of all transactions including non-routine transactions.

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    processes lacked timely and complete reviews and analysis of information used to prepare our financial statements and disclosures
    in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States America.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    did not maintain an effective financial reporting process to prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Specifically
    our process lacked timely and complete financial statement reviews and procedures to ensure all required disclosures were
    made in our financial statements. We also lacked a process to review information used to prepare our financial statements
    and disclosures.



    
    



The
Company is evaluating these weaknesses to determine the appropriate remedy. Because disclosure controls and procedures
include those components of internal control over financial reporting that provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
management also determined that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the foregoing material
weakness in its internal control over financial reporting.

This
Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting as such report is not required for smaller reporting companies.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by
paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the current fiscal quarter that have materially
affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting. During the first quarter
of 2018
 Mr. Thomas resigned as CEO
 and Mr. Malik was appointed as CEO
 as well as the Company&rsquo;s controller resigned.

 the Company has a
significant working capital deficiency

and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going
concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.




of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable

the financial statements are free of material misstatement

nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.


to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN

Business
Organization 

Long
Blockchain Corp.
 (formerly known as Long Island Iced Tea Corp.) a Delaware corporation (&ldquo;LBCC&rdquo;)
 was formed on December
23
 2014. LBCC is the parent of Long Island Brand Beverages LLC (&ldquo;LIBB&rdquo;) (its operating subsidiary) and Cullen Agricultural
Holding Corp. (&ldquo;Cullen&rdquo;) (collectively the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;).




Since
May 27
 2015
 the Company&rsquo;s operations have consisted principally of a beverage business
 focused on serving the ready-to-drink
segment of the market. On December 21
 2017
 the Company announced that it was expanding its attention to include
the exploration of
 and investment in
 opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology. The Company changed
its name from &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rdquo; to &ldquo;Long Blockchain Corp.&rdquo; and reserved the web domain www.longblockchain.com.
The Company also changed its trading symbol from &ldquo;LTEA&rdquo; to &ldquo;LBCC&rdquo; in connection with this name change.
At such time
 the Company announced that it would continue to operate the beverage business.


On
February 20
 2018
 in connection with the pivot of the Company&rsquo;s operation toward Blockchain
 Mr. Philip Thomas
 the Company&rsquo;s
President and Chief Executive Officer (&ldquo;CEO&rdquo;) resigned and simultaneously
 the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
appointed Mr. Shamyl Malik
 who was appointed to the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors during December 2017
 as CEO. The Company
announced that it would seek to spin out the beverage business to the Company&rsquo;s shareholders (&ldquo;Beverage Spin Out&rdquo;).
On February 12
 2018
 in connection with the Beverage Spin Out
 the Company formed Long Island Iced Tea Corp.
 a Delaware corporation.
Further
 the board of directors appointed three members of its board to provide oversight of the beverage operations (&ldquo;Beverage
Committee&rdquo;). From this date until the consummation of the Beverage Spin Out
 Mr. Thomas
 under the direction of the Beverage
Committee
 shall provide day to day operational control and management of the beverage business.

The
Blockchain Business

On
December 21
 2017
 the Company announced that it was expanding its attention to include the exploration of
 and investment
in
 opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.

The
Company&rsquo;s management has been pursuing and evaluating investments
 ventures
 alliances and other strategic relationships
in the blockchain space. On March 15
 2018
 LBCC entered into an agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Hashcove Limited
an early stage UK-based technology company focused on developing and deploying globally scalable distributed ledger technology
solutions. The Company is conducting further diligence and is targeting to consummate the acquisition within the third quarter
of 2018. During January 2018
 the Company had entered into an agreement to purchase equipment for a crypto currency mining operation
however
 the Company was not able to raise the capital to consummate this transaction. On March 19
 2018 and March 22
 2018 the
company closed on the purchase of non-controlling interest of Stater Blockchain Limited and TSLC PTE Ltd.
 respectively (See Note
16).

The
Beverage Business

The
Company&rsquo;s beverage business is engaged in the production and distribution of premium Non-Alcoholic ready-to-drink (&ldquo;NARTD&rdquo;)
beverages. The beverage business is currently organized under its flagship brand
 Long Island Iced Tea
 a premium NARTD tea made
from a proprietary recipe and with quality components. The mission of the beverage business is to provide consumers with premium
beverages offered at an affordable price.

 LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN (CONTINUED)

The
Beverage Business
 continued

Through
its beverage business
 the Company aspires to provide iced tea beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers. There
are two major target markets for Long Island Iced Tea: &ldquo;consumers on the go&rdquo; and &ldquo;health conscious consumers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Consumers on the go&rdquo; are families
 employees
 students and other consumers who lead a busy lifestyle. With increasingly
hectic and demanding schedules
 there is a need for products that are accessible and readily available. &ldquo;Health conscious
consumers&rdquo; are individuals who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included in their diets
 causing
them to shift away from the less healthy options
 such as carbonated soft drinks
 towards alternative beverages such as iced tea.

Through
its beverage business
 the Company produces a 100% brewed iced tea
 using black tea leaves
 purified water and natural cane sugar
or sucralose. Flavors change from time to time
 and have included lemon
 peach
 raspberry
 guava
 mango
 diet lemon
 diet peach
sweet tea
 green tea and honey
 half tea and half lemonade. The Company also offers lower calorie iced tea in flavor options that
include mango
 raspberry and peach. The Company also sells its iced tea in gallon bottles with flavor options including lemon
peach
 green tea and honey
 half and half lemonade
 sweet tea
 mango and unsweetened.

During
April 2017
 the Company through its beverage business expanded its brand to include lemonade. Lemonade is offered in nine flavors
including traditional
 lime
 pink lemonade
 kiwi &amp; strawberry
 cherry
 peach
 watermelon
 wild berries and strawberry and
is offered at retail in 18oz. bottles.

The
Company also distributes an aloe vera derived juice beverage (&ldquo;ALO Juice&rdquo;) in 500ml and 1.5 liter bottles. ALO Juice
is offered in six flavors including original
 pomegranate
 mango
 raspberry
 pineapple and coconut. See below regarding the ALO
Juice business. In addition
 in order to service certain vending contracts
 the Company sells snacks and other beverage products
on a limited basis.


The
Company sells its products to regional retail chains and to a mix of independent mid-to-large range distributors who in turn sell
to retail outlets
 such as big chain supermarkets
 mass merchants
 convenience stores
 restaurants and hotels
 principally in
the New York
 New Jersey
 Connecticut and Pennsylvania markets
 with additional distribution in Florida
 Virginia
 Massachusetts
New Hampshire
 Rhode Island and parts of the Midwest. As of December 31
 2017
 the Company&rsquo;s products are available in approximately
21 states
 the Caribbean and in Canada.

Asset
Purchase Agreement

On
December 8
 2016
 the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with The Wilnah International
 LLC (&ldquo;Wilnah&rdquo;).
Julio X. Ponce (&ldquo;Mr. Ponce&rdquo;) is the majority interest member of Wilnah and also the former owner of Seba Distribution
LLC (&ldquo;Seba&rdquo;)
 a former distributor of ALO Juice. Pursuant to the agreement
 the Company intended to acquire the intellectual
property (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) (trade names
 formulas
 recipes) for ALO Juice. During September 2017
 the Company determined that
it would license
 rather than purchase the ALO Juice IP. Accordingly
 on September 18
 2017
 the Company terminated the asset
purchase agreement with Wilnah.

Licensing
Agreement &ndash; ALO Juice

On
September 18
 2017
 the Company entered into an exclusive perpetual licensing agreement (&ldquo;Licensing Agreement&rdquo;) with
Wilnah granting the Company the worldwide rights to produce
 distribute and sell the ALO Juice brand. As compensation to Wilnah
for these rights
 the Company paid an initial fee of $150
000
 which was applied against certain accounts receivable amounts due
from Seba upon the closing and has agreed to pay to Wilnah a 7.0% royalty on the Company&rsquo;s gross sales of ALO Juice sales
delivered to the Company&rsquo;s customers after the closing of this agreement (See Note 2 for a disclosure of impairment of this
intangible asset).

Employment
Agreement

Effective
January 1
 2017

 to expand the Company&rsquo;s sales of Long
Island branded products and ALO Juice products within the Southeast U.S. and Latin American regions. On September 1

 the
Company terminated the employment agreement of Mr. Ponce.

On
September 1

and Going Concern

From

 the Company sold 448
160 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock in a public offering at a price of $5.00 per
share. Of the shares sold
 200
000 were sold to lead investors who
 as a result of purchasing more than $500
000 in shares
 each
received (i) an additional number of shares of common stock equal to 7% of the total number of shares of common stock purchased
by such lead investors in this offering (or an aggregate of 14
000 shares) and (ii) three-year warrants up to that number of shares
of common stock equal to 20% of the total number of shares purchased by such lead investors in this offering (or warrants to purchase
an aggregate of 40
000 shares). These warrants have an exercise price of $5.50 and were fully vested upon issuance. The sale of
common stock generated gross proceeds of $2
240
800 and net proceeds of $2
134
487 after deducting commissions and other offering
expenses.

On
October 4
 2017
 the Company sold 607
500 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock in a public offering at a price of $2.05
per share. The Company received gross proceeds of $1

375 and net proceeds of $1
235
088 after deducting other offering expenses.
Each investor in the offering also received a warrant to purchase 50% of the number of shares for which such investor subscribed
in the offering (or a total aggregate number of shares underlying such warrants equal to 303
750 shares). The warrants have an
exercise price of $2.40 per share
 subject to adjustment
 and expire one year from the closing of the offering.

Pursuant
to a bridge financing agreement (&ldquo;Radium Agreement&rdquo;) dated November 27
 2017
 the Company received cash of $750
000
less $7
500 of fees and expenses (See Note 6).

Pursuant
to a Loan and Option Agreement (the &ldquo;Cavendish Loan Agreement&rdquo;) dated December 20
 2017
 the Company has a borrowing
facility of up to $4
000
000
 subject to approval by the lender. During December 2017
 the Company drew $750
000 under this arrangement
and during January 2018
 the Company drew $1
250
000 under this arrangement (See Note 6).

Historically
the Company has financed its operations through the raising of equity capital and through trade credit with its vendors. The Company&rsquo;s
ability to continue its operations and to pay its obligations when they become due is contingent upon the Company obtaining additional
financing. Management&rsquo;s plans include raising additional funds through equity offerings
 debt financings
 or other means.

The
Company will require additional capital to fund the operating losses of the existing business
 as well as to fund the development
of the blockchain business. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to raise such capital on terms acceptable to
the Company or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital
 it may be required to reduce
the scope of its current operations
 as well as defer
 delay and/or curtail its effort to develop the blockchain business. These
steps may include reductions in personnel or other operating cost reductions. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016 have been prepared in accordance
and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;) and
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) regarding consolidated financial
information.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances
and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements
 and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. Actual results could differ from those
which result from using such estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates
 including but not limited to
 assessing the
collectability of accounts receivable
 accrual of rebates to customers
 the valuation of securities
 the valuation of inventory
determining the estimated lives of long-lived assets
 determining the potential impairment of intangibles
 the fair value of warrants
issued
 the fair value of stock options
 the recognition of revenue
 and other legal claims and contingencies. The results of
any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which the changes become evident.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined
to be necessary.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue
is stated net of sales discounts and rebates paid to customers (See Customer Marketing Programs including Sign On and Sales Incentives
below). Net sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met: (1) the price is fixed and determinable; (2) evidence
of a binding arrangement exists (generally
 purchase orders); (3) products have been delivered and there is no future performance
required; and (4) amounts are collectible under normal payment terms.

These
conditions typically occur when the products are delivered to or picked up by the Company&rsquo;s customers. For sales where certain
revenue recognition criteria have not been met at the date of delivery
 the Company defers recognition of such revenue and accounts
receivable until such recognition criteria are met.

Customer
Marketing Programs
 including Sign On and Sales Incentives

The
Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to incent new distribution
 incent the introduction
of a new product line
 or to increase the sale of its products. Among these programs are arrangements under which allowances can
be earned by customers for introducing a product (sign on incentives
 for example)
 for various discounts to the end retailers
or for participating in specific marketing programs. The Company believes that its participation in these programs is essential
to ensuring volume and revenue growth in a competitive marketplace. Depending upon the program
 those incentives are paid in either
cash or the issuance of equity instruments. During the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
 these allowances resulted in reductions
in net sales of $960
298 and $310
089
 respectively. Included in these amounts for the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
are costs of $271
713 and $0
 respectively
 representing the non-cash costs of a sign-on incentive
 presented net of mark-to-market
adjustments for unvested awards related to warrants issued in connection with the signing of a distribution agreement and the
first order with Big Geyser Inc. (&ldquo;Big Geyser&rdquo;) (See Notes 9 and 11).

Shipping
and Handling Costs

Shipping
and handling costs incurred to move finished goods from the Company&rsquo;s sales distribution centers to customer locations are
included in selling and marketing expenses within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and totaled
$815
266 and $420
389
 for the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.




The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs are included in selling and marketing expenses within the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss and totaled $687
245 and $151
438 for the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
respectively.

Research
and Development 

Costs
related to new product initiatives incurred were included in selling and marketing expenses within the consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive loss and totaled $359
554 and $192
857 for the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

Operating
Leases

The
Company records rent related to its operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term.



The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.

Short-term
Investments

The
Company accounts for securities in accordance with accounting standards for investments in debt and equity securities. Accounting
standards require investments in debt and equity securities to be classified as either &ldquo;held to maturity&rdquo;
 &ldquo;trading&rdquo;
or &ldquo;available-for-sale.&rdquo;


The
Company may hold investments in marketable securities
 consisting of U.S. government securities and mutual funds. The Company&rsquo;s
available-for-sale securities were carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses
 net of deferred
taxes
 included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&rsquo; (deficit) equity
 when applicable. During
the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
 the unrealized gain/(loss) was $30
246 and $(30
246)
 respectively.
Realized losses are charged against interest and other income/(expense)
 net
 when a decline in fair value is determined
to be other-than-temporary. The Company has not recorded any such impairment charge in the periods presented. The Company determines
realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method
 and records such gains or losses
as interest and other income/(expense)
 net.

Restricted
Cash

As
of December 31
 2016
 the Company had cash balances of $103
603 that were pledged against the Company&rsquo;s UBS Credit Line.

Accounts
Receivable

The
Company sells products to distributors and in certain cases directly to retailers
 and extends credit
 generally without requiring
collateral
 based on its evaluation of the customer&rsquo;s financial condition. While the Company has a concentration of credit
risk in the retail sector
 it believes this risk is mitigated due to the diverse nature of the customers it serves
 including
but not limited to
 its type
 geographic location
 size
 and beverage channel. Potential losses on the Company&rsquo;s receivables
are dependent on each individual customer&rsquo;s financial condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date.
The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Accounts receivable have terms of ranging from 30 to
75 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential
losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its
history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the
Company&rsquo;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. Accounts receivable are stated at the amounts management
expects to collect.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash on deposit with
financial institutions and accounts receivable. At times
 the Company&rsquo;s cash in banks is in excess of the FDIC insurance
limit. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these cash deposits. These cash balances are maintained with one
bank. The Company is exposed to credit risk with regard to two customers who accounted for 18% and 10%
 or 28% in the aggregate
as of December 31
 2017
 and one customer who accounted for 46% of the Company&rsquo;s trade receivables as of December 31
 2016.
The Company does not generally require collateral or other security to support customer receivables.

The
Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses
 as required.

Inventories



The
Company&rsquo;s inventory includes raw materials such as bottles
 sweeteners
 labels
 flavors and packaging. Finished goods inventory
consists of bottled iced tea
 lemonade and ALO Juice. As of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 included in inventory was finished goods
inventory with a cost

 respectively
 which has been delivered
to one or more of the Company&rsquo;s distributors and is held in inventory until certain revenue recognition criteria are met.

The
Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in
 first-out
(FIFO) method. As of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company recorded inventory reserves
 of $200

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment is recorded at cost. Major property additions
 replacements
 and betterments are capitalized
 while maintenance
and repairs that do not extend the useful lives of an asset or add new functionality are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is
recorded using the straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives of the Company&rsquo;s assets.

The
estimated useful lives typically are 3 years for cold-drink containers
 such as reusable fridges
 wood racks
 vending machines
barrels
 and coolers
 and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each group of equipment
as determined using the group-life method. Under this method
 the Company does not recognize gains or losses on the disposal of
individual units of equipment when the disposal occurs in the normal course of business. The Company capitalizes the costs of
refurbishing its cold-drink containers and depreciates those costs over the estimated period until the next scheduled refurbishment
or until the equipment is retired. The estimated useful lives are typically 3 to 5 years for office furniture and equipment and
are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives for trucks and automobiles are typically 3 to 5 years and
are depreciated on a straight line basis.

Intangible
Assets 

As
of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company tested the domain name utilizing the qualitative method. Based on this analysis
 it
was determined that there were no indicators of impairment as of December 31
 2017 and 2016.

During
September 2017
 the Company recorded an indefinite lived intangible asset representing for the value of the ALO Juice intellectual
property. However
 at December 31
 2017
 the Company tested the fair value of the ALO intangible asset and determined that it
was fully impaired as of such date
 because the Company has de-emphasized the sale of its ALO business in order to better manage
its liquidity. During the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company recorded a charge of $150
000 as an impairment of this intangible
asset.

Intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their expected useful life. Intangible assets with useful lives are tested
for impairment when circumstances indicate that there could be an impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives include
website development costs with a net book value of $0 and $2
500 as of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The estimated
useful life of the capitalized costs of the Company&rsquo;s website was 3 years and was depreciated on a straight line basis.
As of December 31
 2017
 the cost of the website development was $15
000 and the accumulated amortization was $15
000. As of December
31
 2016
 the cost of the website development was $15
000 and the accumulated amortization was $12
500. For the years ended December
31
 2017 and 2016
 amortization expense was $2
500 and $4
994
 respectively.

Deferred
Financing Costs 

The
Company capitalizes issuance costs related to lines of credit as deferred financing costs. The Company amortizes the deferred
financing costs over the term of the line of credit.

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;). ASC 740
requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities
a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures.
The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered
in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting
and tax basis of the Company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences
are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance
when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments
as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax
liability. In management&rsquo;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax
jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.

Income
Taxes
 continued

Based
on the Company&rsquo;s evaluation
 it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition
in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2017 and 2016 tax years. The Company
believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that
will result in a material change to its financial position or results of operations.

The
Company&rsquo;s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax audits is to record such items as a component
of income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties and interest for years ended December 31
 2017 and December
31
 2016. The Company does not expect its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently
unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments
 accruals or material deviations from its position.

On
December 22
 2017
 the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(the &ldquo;Tax Act&rdquo;). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that potentially will affect the
Company&rsquo;s fiscal year ending December 31
 2018.

The
changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the Tax Act are difficult to assess
 due
to
 among other things
 changes in interpretations of the Tax Act
 any legislative action to address questions that arise because
of the Tax Act
 any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act
 or
any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impact. The SEC has issued rules that
would allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the
related tax impacts (See Note 10).

Stock
Based Compensation

The
Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (&ldquo;ASC 718&rdquo;).
ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718
 stock
based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over
the employee&rsquo;s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock options are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility
dividend rate
 risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical
volatility of the Company over the most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available
information indicates that future volatility may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the
Company does not expect to pay or declare any cash dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the
stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant
exercise activity on stock options. Due to the lack of historical information
 the Company determined the expected term of its
stock option awards issued using the simplified method.

The
simplified method assumes each vesting tranche of the award has a term equal to the midpoint between when the award vests and
when the award expires. The Company expenses stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method.

Based Compensation
 continued

The
Company accounts for stock options granted to consultants pursuant to the accounting guidance included in ASC 505-50 &ldquo;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 505-50&rdquo;). Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date and at
the end of each reporting period for unvested awards
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over
the consultant&rsquo;s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&rsquo;s
stock options granted to consultants are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
expected volatility
 dividend rate
 risk free interest rate and the expected life.

In
accordance with ASC 505-50
 the Company recorded adjustments at the end of each reporting period to reflect the mark-to-market
adjustment of the fair value of unvested awards granted to consultants. In connection with the mark-to-market adjustments at December
31
 2017
 the Company utilized the closing price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 as quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC
(&ldquo;Nasdaq&rdquo;)
 as an input to the Black Scholes option-pricing model for the fair value of its common stock.

Loss
per share

Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share reflect
 in periods in which they have a dilutive effect
 the impact of common shares issuable upon the exercise
of stock options
 warrants and the conversion. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes those with an exercise price
in excess of the average market price of the Company&rsquo;s common shares during the periods presented. The computation of diluted
earnings per share excludes outstanding options
 warrants and other dilutive instruments in periods where the inclusion of such
instruments would be antidilutive

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments


The
carrying amounts of cash
 short term investments
 accounts receivable
 automobile and equipment loans approximate fair value due
to the short-term nature of these instruments. In addition
 for notes payable
 the Company believes that interest rates approximate
prevailing rates.


ASC
820 &ldquo;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&rdquo; provides the framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
 continued

Fair
value is defined as an exit price
 representing the amount that would be received upon the sale of an asset or payment to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined
based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is
used to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value as follows:

Level
1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level
2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets

Recent
Accounting Standards



In
January 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;)
 issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;)
2016-01
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities
&rdquo; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement
of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities
under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU
clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized
losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
December 15
 2017
 and is to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the
first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record
fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other
comprehensive income. The Company expects that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact upon the Company
consolidated financial statements.

Recent
Accounting Standards
 continued

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases). Under the new guidance
 at the commencement
date
 lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&rsquo;s obligation to make lease payments arising
from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&rsquo;s right
to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term
of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02
for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is
permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating
leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of
the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any
transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply
a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have
on its consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which has subsequently been amended
by ASU 2015-14
 ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-12
 and ASU 2017-13. These ASUs outline a single comprehensive model for entities
to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance
including industry-specific guidance. The guidance includes a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the
contract(s) with a customer
 (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (iii) determine the transaction price
(iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
 and (v) recognize revenue when the entity
satisfies a performance obligation. In July 2015
 the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption will be permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
2016
 including interim reporting periods within those annual periods. A full retrospective or modified retrospective approach
is required. In addition
 the new guidance will require enhanced disclosures
 including revenue recognition policies to identify
performance obligations to customers and significant judgments in measurement and recognition.

The
Company has elected to apply the modified retrospective method and the impact was determined to be immaterial on the consolidated
financial statements. Accordingly
 the new revenue standard will be applied prospectively in our consolidated financial statements
from January 1
 2018 forward and reported financial information for historical comparable periods will not be revised and will
continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect during those historical periods.

The
Company has performed an analysis and identified its revenues and costs that are within the scope of the new guidance. The Company
anticipates that its current methods of recognizing revenues will not be significantly impacted by the new guidance.

In
January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01
 &ldquo;Clarifying the Definition of a Business&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2017-01&rdquo;)
which provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals)
of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 requires entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and
activities is not a business or if the integrated set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework.
ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim periods within those years. The
Company believes that the adoption of the ASU may have an impact on the Company as it pursues its strategy to develop the blockchain
business.

In
May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09 &ldquo;Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting&rdquo;
(&ldquo;ASU 2017-09&rdquo;). The amendments in this update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of
a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. An entity should account for the
effects of a modification unless all of the following are met: The fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value
of the original award immediately before the original award is modified
 the vesting conditions of the modified award are the
same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified and the classification
of the modified award of an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original
award immediately before the original award is modified. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early adoption permitted. The Company expects that the adoption of the ASU will not have
a material impact upon the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.

Radium2
Capital Inc

On
November 27
 2017
 the Company completed the Radium Agreement with Radium2 Capital Inc. (&ldquo;Radium&rdquo;). Pursuant to the
Radium Agreement
 the Company received cash of $750
000
 less $7
500 of fees and expenses. The Radium borrowing is repaid at a
minimum amount per week
 based upon 15% of the Company&rsquo;s gross sales
 until the Company has repaid a total of $986
250.
The Agreement further provides for a discount on the repayment amount
 provided such prepay obligation of $838
313 is paid within
126 business days from the date of funding. The Radium Agreement was accounted for as a borrowing
 with the difference between
the repayment obligation and the net amount funded being recorded as an original issue discount
 amortized using the interest
method over the expected term of the arrangement. As of December 31
 2017
 the balance of the obligation
 net of the discount
was $688
038
 and was presented as note payable
 current
 within the consolidated financial statements. Since the repayment terms
are based upon the Company&rsquo;s actual future sales
 which are not fixed
 the Company classified the obligation as a current
liability. During the year ended December 31
 2017
 accreted discount amortization was $47
437
 and was reflected as interest
expense within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Court
Cavendish Ltd.

On
December 20
 2017
 the Company entered into the Cavendish Loan Agreement with Court Cavendish Ltd (&ldquo;Cavendish&rdquo;). The
Cavendish Loan Agreement provides for the availability of an initial $2
000
000 (&ldquo;Initial Facility Amount&rdquo;). Cavendish
also agreed to allow for two extensions of $1
000
000 each (&ldquo;Extended Facility Amount&rdquo;
 and together with the Initial
Facility Amount
 the &ldquo;Facilities&rdquo;)
 as long as the Company continued moving towards specific ventures related to the
blockchain technology
 to increase the Facilities to $4
000
000 subject to Cavendish&rsquo;s approval. Interest on the Facilities
shall accrue monthly
 at a rate of 12.5% per annum
 on the unpaid principal balance commencing on the date of the first drawdown
and shall be due and payable
 without demand or notice
 at the Company&rsquo;s election quarterly in cash or in shares of the
Company valued at the lower of $3.00 or the closing price per share on the preceding date the interest payment is due. All principal
and accrued interest under the Facilities is due and payable on December 21
 2018. On such date
 at Cavendish&rsquo;s election
the Company shall repay the outstanding amount together with accrued interest either in cash or in shares of the Company at the
lower of $3.00 or the closing price per share on such date
 but not lower than $2.00 per share. In connection with the Cavendish
Loan Agreement
 a facility fee of 5% (&ldquo;Original Issue Discount&rdquo; or &ldquo;OID&rdquo;) of each of the Initial Facility
Amount and the Extended Facility Amount is payable on the date of the first drawdown under each such facility and payable in either
cash or stock. The facility fee on the Initial Facility Amount of $100
000 was withheld from the proceeds of the initial $750
000
funding under the Cavendish Loan Agreement.

In
connection with the Initial Facility Amount
 the Company issued to Cavendish a warrant to purchase 100
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock with a three year life and an exercise price of $3.00 per share. This warrant had a gross fair value of $165
645
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Upon the first draw under the Extended Facility Amount
 the Company shall issue
a warrant to purchase an additional 50
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 with the same terms
 for each of the $1
000
000
extensions that are made available under the Extended Facility Amount.

The
$100
000 fee and the warrant to issue 100
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock were considered costs of the Initial
Facility Amount.

For
the Initial Facility Amount
 the $100
000 fee was charged in full as a cost of the facility and the warrant was charged on a relative
fair value basis
 or in the amount of $152
363. These costs were initially charged to deferred financing costs
 since these costs
were associated with the Initial Facility Amount and not to a single funding. Thereafter
 these deferred costs shall be charged
on a pro rata basis as a direct offset against the fundings as they occur
 and such costs would be amortized using the interest
method over the term of each funding loan.

On
December 21
 2017
 the Company requested a funding of $750
000 under the Initial Financing Facility
 which was received by the
Company on December 22
 2017. OID costs of $37
500 and warrant costs of $57
136
 were from deferred financing costs were directly
offset against this funding.

The
Company then evaluated the funding transaction to determine whether or not there was a beneficial conversion feature. Accordingly
the Company determined that after the effect of the OID and the warrant
 that the effective conversion price was $2.13 per share.
With a market price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock on December 20
 2017
 of $2.44
 the Company determined that there was
a beneficial conversion with a value of $94
636. The beneficial conversion feature was accounted for as a credit to additional
paid in capital and a direct offset to the funded loan amount
 with such costs amortized using the interest method over the term
of each funding loan.

On
December 26
 2017
 Cavendish converted the principal of $750
000 and accrued interest and thereupon was issued 250
233 shares
based upon an exercise price of $3.00 per share. Accordingly
 in recording the conversion
 the Company recognized $189
272 in
interest expense for the unamortized debt discount and then the principal value of the note of $750
000 was credited to additional
paid in capital and common stock.

The
Company received an additional drawdown of $750
000 of the Initial Facility Amount on January 15
 2018. The Company received the
final drawdown of $500
000 of the Initial Facility Amount on January 30
 2018. Since the Company is no longer listed on NASDAQ
(See Note 11)
 the remaining amount under the Extended Facility Amount will not be available to the Company unless Cavendish were

000 units were sold to Thomas
Cardella
 who subsequently became a member of the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors
 and 7
500 shares were sold to Paul Vassilakos
a member of the Board of Directors. The sales were part of a private placement of up to $3

 at a price of $0.01 per warrant
 if (i) the closing
price per share of the common stock is at least $10.00 for 30 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day prior
to the notice of redemption or (ii) the common stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange and the closing price
per share of common stock on the first day of trading on such exchange is at least $7.50. The right to exercise will be forfeited
unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and after the redemption date
 a

Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 imposes limitations on the use of net operating loss carryovers (&ldquo;NOLs&rdquo;) when the stock ownership
of one or more 5% shareholders (shareholders owning 5% or more of the Company&rsquo;s outstanding capital stock) has increased
on a cumulative basis by more than 50 percentage points.


On
March 28
 2017
 the stock ownership of one or more 5% shareholders (shareholders owning 5% or more of the Company&rsquo;s outstanding
capital stock) had increased on a cumulative basis by more than 50 percentage points
 triggering a limitation under Section 382.
Provided that certain requirements for business continuity are met
 upon a change of ownership under Section 382
 the cumulative
net operating losses would be subject to an annual limitation based upon the fair value of the Company multiplied by the long-term
tax exempt bond rate. The Company determined that this annual limitation was de minimis. Accordingly
 the Company&rsquo;s NOLs
in the aggregate gross amount of $11
427
095 were not eligible to be carried forward past the date of the Section 382. This resulted
in an impairment of the NOL carryover amount.

NOTE
10 &ndash; INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)


Based
on a history of cumulative losses at the Company and the results of operations for the years ended December 31
 2017
and 2016
 the Company determined that it is more likely than not that it will not realize benefits from the deferred tax
assets. The Company will not record income tax benefits in the consolidated financial statements until it is determined that
it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred income tax
assets. As a result of the analysis
 the Company determined that a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets
was required. The Company recognized a deferred tax expense of $1
467
847 to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate of the Tax Act
and a corresponding deferred tax benefit to reflect the reduction of the valuation allowance. As of December 31
 2017
 the
Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $3
278
188.

As
of December 31
 2017
 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately
$9
145
639 and $9
145
639
 respectively.

The
Company remains subject to examination by tax authorities for tax years 2014 through 2016. The Company files income tax returns
in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and approximately 11 states.

As
of December 31
 2017
 management does not believe the Company has any material uncertain tax positions that would require it to
measure and reflect the potential lack of sustainability of a position on audit in its financial statements. The Company will
continue to evaluate its uncertain tax positions in future periods to determine if measurement and recognition in its financial
statements is necessary. The Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over
the next year.

Delivery
    of Purchased Amount: Seller must deposit all Future Receipts into the single business banking account specified above
 which
    may not be used for any personal
 family or household purposes (the &ldquo;Account&rdquo;) and must instruct Seller&rsquo;s
    credit card processor
 which must be approved by Buyer (the &ldquo;Processor&rdquo;) to deposit all Payment Card receipts
    of Seller into the Account. Seller agrees not to change the Account or add an additional Account without the express written
    consent of Buyer. Seller authorizes Buyer to debit the weekly Amount from the Account each business day by either ACH or electronic
    check. Seller will provide Buyer with all required access codes and agrees not to change them without prior written consent
    from Buyer. Seller will provide an appropriate ACH authorization to Buyer. Seller understands that it is responsible for either
    ensuring that the weekly Amount is available in the Account each business weekday or advising Buyer prior to each weekly withdrawal
    of a shortage of funds. Otherwise
 Seller will be responsible for any fees incurred by Buyer resulting from a rejected electronic
    check or ACH debit attempt
 as set forth on Appendix A. Buyer is not responsible for any overdrafts or rejected transactions
    that may result from Buyer&rsquo;s debiting any amount authorized under the terms of this Agreement. Seller understands that
    the foregoing ACH authorization is a fundamental condition to induce Buyer to accept the Agreement. Consequently
 such authorization
    is intended to be irrevocable.

    
    

    
Seller
    May Request Changes to the Daily Amount: The initial Daily Amount is intended to represent the Specified Percentage of Seller&rsquo;s
    daily Future Receipts. For as long as no Event of Default has occurred
 once each calendar month
 Seller may request that
    Buyer adjust the Daily Amount to more closely reflect the Seller&rsquo;s actual Future Receipts times the Specified Percentage.
    Seller agrees to provide Buyer any information reasonably requested by Buyer to assist in this reconciliation. No more often
    than once a month
 Buyer may adjust the Daily Amount on a going-forward basis to more closely reflect the Seller&rsquo;s actual
    Future Receipts times the Specified Percentage. Buyer will give Seller notice five business days prior to any such adjustment.
    After each adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph
 the new dollar amount shall be deemed the Daily Amount until any subsequent
    adjustment.

    
    

    
Weekly
    Amount Upon Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
 the Weekly Amount shall equal 100% of all Future Receipts.

    
    

    
Sale
    of Future Receipts (THIS IS NOT A LOAN): Seller is selling a portion of a future revenue stream to Buyer at a discount
 not
    borrowing money from Buyer. There is no interest rate or payment schedule and no time period during which the Purchased Amount
    must be collected by Buyer. If Future Receipts are remitted more slowly than Buyer may have anticipated or projected because
    Seller&rsquo;s business has slowed down
 or if the full Purchased Amount is never remitted because Seller&rsquo;s business
    went bankrupt or otherwise ceased operations in the ordinary course of business
 and Seller has not breached this Agreement
    Seller would not owe anything to Buyer and would not be in breach of or default under this Agreement. Buyer is buying the
    Purchased Amount of Future Receipts knowing the risks that Seller&rsquo;s business may slow down or fail
 and Buyer assumes
    these risks based on Seller&rsquo;s representations
 warranties and covenants in this Agreement that are designed to give
    Buyer a reasonable and fair opportunity to receive the benefit of its bargain. By this Agreement
 Seller transfers to Buyer
    full and complete ownership of the Purchased Amount of Future Receipts and Seller retains no legal or equitable interest therein.
    Seller agrees that it will treat Purchase Price and Purchased Amount in a manner consistent with a sale in its accounting
    records and tax returns. Seller agrees that Buyer is entitled to audit Seller&rsquo;s accounting records upon reasonable Notice
    in order to verify compliance. Seller waives any rights of privacy
 confidentiality or taxpayer privilege in any such litigation
    or arbitration in which Seller asserts that this transaction is anything other than a sale of future receipts.

    
    

    
Power
    of Attorney. Solely in connection with this Agreement
 Seller irrevocably appoints Buyer as its agent and attorney-in-fact
    with full authority to take any action or execute any instrument or document to settle all obligations due to Buyer from Seller
    or in the case of a violation by Seller of this Agreement or the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 15 hereof
    by Seller
 including without limitation (i) to obtain and adjust insurance; (ii) to collect monies due or to become due under
    or in respect of any of the Future Receipts; (iii) to receive
 endorse and collect any checks
 notes
 drafts
 instruments
    documents or chattel paper in connection with clause (i) or clause (ii) above; (iv) to sign Seller&rsquo;s name on any invoice
    bill of lading
 or assignment directing customers or account debtors to direct payables to Buyer; (v) to file any claims or
    take any action or institute any proceeding which Buyer may deem necessary for the collection of any of the remaining Purchased
    Amount of the Future Receipts
 or otherwise to enforce its rights with respect to delivery of the Purchased Amount; and/or
    (vi) to contact any Processor of Seller and to direct such Processor(s) to deliver directly to Buyer all or any portion of
    the amounts received by such Processor(s) and to provide any information regarding Seller requested by Buyer. Each Processor
    may rely on the previous sentence as written authorization of Seller to provide any information requested by Buyer. Each Processor
    is hereby irrevocably authorized and directed by Seller to follow any instruction of Buyer without inquiry as to Buyer&rsquo;s
    right or authority to give such instructions. Seller acknowledges the terms of the preceding sentence and agrees not to (a)
    interfere with Buyer&rsquo;s instructions or a Processor&rsquo;s compliance with this Agreement or (b) request any modification
    thereto without Buyer&rsquo;s prior written consent.

    and credit profiles from time to time as it deems appropriate. Seller waives
 to the maximum extent permitted by law
 any
    claim for damages against Buyer or any of its affiliates relating to any investigation undertaken by or on behalf of Buyer
    as permitted by this Agreement or disclosure of information as permitted by this Agreement.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;On November 27, 2017, the Company completed&#13;the Radium Agreement with Radium2 Capital Inc. (&amp;#8220;Radium&amp;#8221;). Pursuant to the Radium Agreement, the Company received cash&#13;of $750,000, less $7,500 of fees and expenses. The Radium borrowing is repaid at a minimum amount per week, based upon 15% of the&#13;Company&amp;#8217;s gross sales, until the Company has repaid a total of $986,250. The Agreement further provides for a discount on&#13;the repayment amount, provided such prepay obligation of $838,313 is paid within 126 business days from the date of funding. The&#13;Radium Agreement was accounted for as a borrowing, with the difference between the repayment obligation and the net amount funded&#13;being recorded as an original issue discount, amortized using the interest method over the expected term of the arrangement. As&#13;of December 31, 2017, the balance of the obligation, net of the discount was $688,038, and was presented as note payable, current,&#13;within the consolidated financial statements. Since the repayment terms are based upon the Company&amp;#8217;s actual future sales,&#13;which are not fixed, the Company classified the obligation as a current liability. During the year ended December 31, 2017, accreted&#13;discount amortization was $47,437, and was reflected as interest expense within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive&#13;loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;On December 20, 2017, the Company entered into&#13;the Cavendish Loan Agreement with Court Cavendish Ltd (&amp;#8220;Cavendish&amp;#8221;). The Cavendish Loan Agreement provides for the&#13;availability of an initial $2,000,000 (&amp;#8220;Initial Facility Amount&amp;#8221;). Cavendish also agreed to allow for two extensions&#13;of $1,000,000 each (&amp;#8220;Extended Facility Amount&amp;#8221;, and together with the Initial Facility Amount, the &amp;#8220;Facilities&amp;#8221;),&#13;as long as the Company continued moving towards specific ventures related to the blockchain technology, to increase the Facilities&#13;to $4,000,000 subject to Cavendish&amp;#8217;s approval. Interest on the Facilities shall accrue monthly, at a rate of 12.5% per annum,&#13;on the unpaid principal balance commencing on the date of the first drawdown and shall be due and payable, without demand or notice,&#13;at the Company&amp;#8217;s election quarterly in cash or in shares of the Company valued at the lower of $3.00 or the closing price&#13;per share on the preceding date the interest payment is due. All principal and accrued interest under the Facilities is due and&#13;payable on December 21, 2018. On such date, at Cavendish&amp;#8217;s election, the Company shall repay the outstanding amount together&#13;with accrued interest either in cash or in shares of the Company at the lower of $3.00 or the closing price per share on such date,&#13;but not lower than $2.00 per share. In connection with the Cavendish Loan Agreement, a facility fee of 5% (&amp;#8220;Original Issue&#13;Discount&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;OID&amp;#8221;) of each of the Initial Facility Amount and the Extended Facility Amount is payable on the&#13;date of the first drawdown under each such facility and payable in either cash or stock. The facility fee on the Initial Facility&#13;Amount of $100,000 was withheld from the proceeds of the initial $750,000 funding under the Cavendish Loan Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

This warrant had a gross fair value of $165,645, using the Black-Scholes option pricing&#13;model. Upon the first draw under the Extended Facility Amount, the Company shall issue a warrant to purchase an additional 50,000&#13;shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock, with the same terms, for each of the $1,000,000 extensions that are made available&#13;under the Extended Facility Amount.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

These costs were initially charged to deferred financing costs, since these costs were associated with the Initial&#13;Facility Amount and not to a single funding. Thereafter, these deferred costs shall be charged on a pro rata basis as a direct&#13;offset against the fundings as they occur, and such costs would be amortized using the interest method over the term of each funding&#13;loan.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

LIBB is seeking damages of $10,000,000 for several claims including breach of contract&#13;and fraud occurring during 2014. Revolution has filed a counterclaim for breach of contract and related causes of action, claiming&#13;damages in the sum of $310,880, and seeking punitive damages of $5,000,000. Ascent has filed a pre-answer motion to dismiss LIBB&amp;#8217;s&#13;complaint. LIBB filed papers in opposition and the motion was submitted by March 9, 2015. In addition, Revolution has filed a motion&#13;to amend its answer to include cross-claims against Ascent which were not asserted in its original answer of record. On February&#13;5, 2016, the Court rendered a decision. The motion to dismiss was denied with the exception of two claims which the Court dismissed.&#13;In the same decision, the Court granted a separate motion filed by Revolution to amend its answer to include cross-claims against&#13;Ascent. On June 23, 2017, both defendants filed motions to dismiss based upon delays in producing documents, which were fully submitted.&#13;On August 7, 2017, oral arguments were held.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;The preparation of financial statements in&#13;conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and&#13;liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and also affect&#13;the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. Actual results could differ from those which result from using such&#13;estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates, including but not limited to, assessing the collectability of accounts&#13;receivable, accrual of rebates to customers, the valuation of securities, the valuation of inventory, determining the estimated&#13;lives of long-lived assets, determining the potential impairment of intangibles, the fair value of warrants issued, the fair value&#13;of stock options, the recognition of revenue, and other legal claims and contingencies. The results of any changes in accounting&#13;estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which the changes become evident. Estimates and assumptions&#13;are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;The Company sells products to distributors&#13;and in certain cases directly to retailers, and extends credit, generally without requiring collateral, based on its evaluation&#13;of the customer&amp;#8217;s financial condition. While the Company has a concentration of credit risk in the retail sector, it believes&#13;this risk is mitigated due to the diverse nature of the customers it serves, including, but not limited to, its type, geographic&#13;location, size, and beverage channel. Potential losses on the Company&amp;#8217;s receivables are dependent on each individual customer&amp;#8217;s&#13;financial condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date. The Company carries its trade accounts receivable&#13;at net realizable value. Accounts receivable have terms of ranging from 30 to 75 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors&#13;its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments. The Company determines these&#13;allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its&#13;high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the Company&amp;#8217;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting&#13;the amount due. Accounts receivable are stated at the amounts management expects to collect.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial&#13;accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition&#13;of the benefit of tax positions, and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income&#13;or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income&#13;taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&amp;#8217;s assets and&#13;liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates&#13;the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion&#13;or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might&#13;be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&amp;#8217;s opinion, adequate provisions&#13;for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals&#13;of reserves may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based&#13;awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant&#13;date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee&amp;#8217;s requisite service period (generally&#13;the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock options are estimated using the Black&#13;Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility, dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the&#13;expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical volatility of the Company over the most recent&#13;period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available information indicates that future volatility may&#13;differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company does not expect to pay or declare any cash&#13;dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury yield&#13;curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant exercise activity on stock options. Due to&#13;the lack of historical information, the Company determined the expected term of its stock option awards issued using the simplified&#13;method.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes&#13;the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards&#13;Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;), issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) 2016-01, &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall&#13;(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,&amp;#8221; which amends the guidance&#13;in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the&#13;current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and&#13;the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the&#13;valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt&#13;securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and is to be&#13;adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which&#13;the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial&#13;liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company&#13;expects that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact upon the Company consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;In February 2016, the FASB issued new lease&#13;accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02, Leases). Under the new guidance, at the commencement date, lessees will be required to recognize&#13;a lease liability, which is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis;&#13;and a right-of use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use, or control the use of, a specified&#13;asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is&#13;largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December&#13;15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital&#13;and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective&#13;transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in&#13;the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired&#13;before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The&#13;Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,&#13;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which has subsequently been amended by ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10,&#13;ASU 2016-12, and ASU 2017-13. These ASUs outline a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising&#13;from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The&#13;guidance includes a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify&#13;the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the&#13;performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In July&#13;2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early&#13;adoption will be permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods&#13;within those annual periods. A full retrospective or modified retrospective approach is required. In addition, the new guidance&#13;will require enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and&#13;significant judgments in measurement and recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

ASU 2017-01 requires&#13;entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business or if the integrated&#13;set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The Company believes that the adoption of the ASU may have&#13;an impact on the Company as it pursues its strategy to develop the blockchain business.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

The amendments&#13;in this update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity&#13;to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all of the following&#13;are met: The fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the original&#13;award is modified, the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately&#13;before the original award is modified and the classification of the modified award of an equity instrument or a liability instrument&#13;is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. The provisions of this&#13;update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company&#13;expects that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact upon the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

While the Company has a concentration of credit risk in the retail sector, it believes&#13;this risk is mitigated due to the diverse nature of the customers it serves, including, but not limited to, its type, geographic&#13;location, size, and beverage channel. Potential losses on the Company&amp;#8217;s receivables are dependent on each individual customer&amp;#8217;s&#13;financial condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date. The Company carries its trade accounts receivable&#13;at net realizable value. Accounts receivable have terms of ranging from 30 to 75 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors&#13;its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments. The Company determines these&#13;allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its&#13;high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the Company&amp;#8217;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting&#13;the amount due.

ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial&#13;accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition&#13;of the benefit of tax positions, and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income&#13;or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income&#13;taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&amp;#8217;s assets and&#13;liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates&#13;the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion&#13;or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might&#13;be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&amp;#8217;s opinion, adequate provisions&#13;for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals&#13;of reserves may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;The Company accounts for stock based compensation&#13;in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (&amp;#8220;ASC 718&amp;#8221;). ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based&#13;awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant&#13;date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee&amp;#8217;s requisite service period (generally&#13;the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock options are estimated using the Black&#13;Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility, dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the&#13;expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical volatility of the Company over the most recent&#13;period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available information indicates that future volatility may&#13;differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company does not expect to pay or declare any cash&#13;dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury yield&#13;curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant exercise activity on stock options. Due to&#13;the lack of historical information, the Company determined the expected term of its stock option awards issued using the simplified&#13;method.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

Changes to the&#13;current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and&#13;the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the&#13;valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt&#13;securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and is to be&#13;adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which&#13;the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial&#13;liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;In February 2016, the FASB issued new lease&#13;accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02, Leases). Under the new guidance, at the commencement date, lessees will be required to recognize&#13;a lease liability, which is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis;&#13;and a right-of use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use, or control the use of, a specified&#13;asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is&#13;largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December&#13;15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital&#13;and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective&#13;transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in&#13;the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired&#13;before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The&#13;Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

These ASUs outline a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising&#13;from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The&#13;guidance includes a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify&#13;the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the&#13;performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In July&#13;2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early&#13;adoption will be permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods&#13;within those annual periods.

ASU 2017-01 requires&#13;entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business or if the integrated&#13;set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The Company believes that the adoption of the ASU may have&#13;an impact on the Company as it pursues its strategy to develop the blockchain business.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;On March 28, 2017, the stock ownership of one&#13;or more 5% shareholders (shareholders owning 5% or more of the Company&amp;#8217;s outstanding capital stock) had increased on a cumulative&#13;basis by more than 50 percentage points, triggering a limitation under Section 382. Provided that certain requirements for business&#13;continuity are met, upon a change of ownership under Section 382, the cumulative net operating losses would be subject to an annual&#13;limitation based upon the fair value of the Company multiplied by the long-term tax exempt bond rate. The Company determined that&#13;this annual limitation was de minimis. Accordingly, the Company&amp;#8217;s NOLs in the aggregate gross amount of $11,427,095 were&#13;not eligible to be carried forward past the date of the Section 382. This resulted in an impairment of the NOL carryover amount.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;Based on a history of cumulative losses at&#13;the Company and the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company determined that it is more&#13;likely than not that it will not realize benefits from the deferred tax assets. The Company will not record income tax benefits&#13;in the consolidated financial statements until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate&#13;sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred income tax assets. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that a&#13;full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets was required. The Company recognized a deferred tax expense of $1,467,847&#13;to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate of the Tax Act and a corresponding deferred tax benefit to reflect the reduction of the valuation&#13;allowance. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $3,278,188.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman
