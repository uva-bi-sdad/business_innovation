Coors was incorporated in June 1913 under the laws of the state of Colorado. In October 2003
 Coors merged with and into Adolph Coors Company
 a Delaware corporation. In February 2005
 upon completion of the Merger
During 2015
 Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV&#8217;s (&#8220;ABI&#8221;) announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SABMiller plc (SABMiller) (&#8220;ABI/SABMiller transaction&#8221;) and concurrently
 on November 11
 2015
 we entered into a purchase agreement (as amended
 the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with ABI to acquire
 contingent upon the closing of the ABI/SABMiller transaction
 all of SABMiller&#8217;s 58% economic interest and 50% voting interest in MillerCoors and all trademarks
&#32;in cash
October&#160;11
 2016
 the Acquisition was completed and MillerCoors
 previously a joint venture between MCBC and SABMiller
 became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC and as a result
The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years
 becoming an increasingly global beer market. The industry was previously founded on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export
 license and partnership arrangements. More recently
 it has become increasingly complex
 as the consolidation of brewers has occurred globally
 resulting in fewer major global market participants. In addition to the acquisitive element of this industry consolidation
 the market continues to utilize export
 license and partnership arrangements; however
 these are often with the same global competitors that make up the majority of the market. This industry consolidation has resulted in a small number of large global brewers representing the majority of the worldwide beer market. At the same time
 smaller local brewers within certain established markets are experiencing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on&#160;locally-produced
 regionally-sourced products.&#160;As the beer industry continues its evolution of consolidation and diversification of its products to meet consumer demand with broadening preferences
 large global brewers are uniquely positioned to leverage the scale
We evaluate ourselves in relation to other global brewers using various metrics
 including overall market capitalization
 volume
 net sales revenue
 gross margins and net profits
 as well as our position within each of our core markets
 with the goal to be the first choice for our consumers and customers. To provide a perspective of the relative size of the major participants in the global brewing market

Manufacturing
We use high quality ingredients to brew our products. We malt a portion of our production requirements
 using barley purchased under annual contracts from independent farmers located in the western United States. Other barley
 malt
 and cereal grains are purchased from suppliers primarily in the U.S. Hops are purchased from suppliers in the U.S.
We currently operate seven large breweries
 five craft breweries
 two container operations and one cidery. MillerCoors closed its Eden
 North Carolina brewery in September of 2016. We import 

. A portion of the aluminum containers were purchased from Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC)
 a joint venture between MillerCoors and Ball Corporation (Ball)
 whose production facilities
 which are leased from us
 are located near our brewery in Golden
 Colorado. In addition to the supply agreement with RMMC
 we have a supply agreement with Ball to purchase cans and ends in excess of what is supplied through RMMC. In 2011
 MillerCoors signed a 10-year contract extension with Ball to extend the RMMC joint venture agreement along with the can and end purchase agreements
 both of which will expire December 31

We have an agreement to brew
 package and ship products for Pabst Brewing Company through June 2020. Additionally
 the U.S. segment produces beer for our Canada and MCI segments. As a result of the Acquisition
Total industry volume in the U.S. is sensitive to factors such as weather
 changes in demographics
 consumer preferences and drinking occasions. Weather conditions consisting of high temperatures and extended periods of warm weather favor increased consumption of our products
 while unseasonably cool or wet weather
 especially during the summer months
 adversely affects our sales volumes and net sales. Accordingly
 consumption of beer in the U.S. is seasonal
The beer industry in the United States is highly competitive
 and the two largest brewers
. The formation of MillerCoors in 2008 created a stronger U.S. presence for MCBC with the scale
 operational efficiency and distribution platform to compete more effectively in the U.S. marketplace and we expect to continue our U.S. presence through the MillerCoors business which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC on October 11
 2016
 as a result of the Acquisition. Growing or even maintaining market share has required significant investments in marketing. From 1998 to 2008
 the U.S. beer industry shipments annual growth rate approximated 1%
 compared with declines ranging from 1% to 2% in each of the years 2009
 2010 and 2011. With ideal weather conditions
 industry volumes improved slightly in 2012
 growing approximately 1%. However
 in 2013 the industry saw a decline of less than 1%
 and in 2014
 the industry grew slightly
 by less than 1%. In 2015 and 2016
Overall declines in the U.S. beer industry volumes since 2009 have been partially attributed to per capita beer consumption declines as consumer preferences shifted to higher alcohol
 full calorie beers
 as well as spirits and wine. Competition from outside of the beer category continues to be a challenge and despite recent improvement in economic indicators
 the industry is still recovering from multiple years of challenging economic conditions such as with higher rates of unemployment
The following table summarizes the estimated percentage market share by volume of beer (including adjacencies
&#32;data
 when available
Our portfolio of beers competes with numerous above-premium
 premium
 and economy brands. These competing brands are produced by international
 national
 regional and local brewers. We compete most directly with ABI brands
 but also compete with imported and craft beer brands. The following table summarizes the estimated percentage share of the U.S. beer market represented by MillerCoors
Our products also compete with other alcohol beverages
 including wine and spirits
 and thus their competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories. Driven by increased spirits advertising along with increased wine and spirits sales execution
 sales of wine and spirits have grown faster than sales of beer in recent years
The U.S. beer business is regulated by federal
 state
 and local governments. These regulations govern many parts of our operations
 including brewing
 marketing and advertising
 transportation
 distributor relationships
 sales
 and environmental issues. To operate our facilities
 we must obtain and maintain numerous permits
 licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies
 including the U.S. Treasury Department
 Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau
 the U.S. Department of Agriculture
 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 state alcohol regulatory agencies
 and state and federal environmental agencies.

The Canada segment also includes our partnership arrangements related to the distribution of beer in Ontario
 Brewers' Retail&#160;Inc. (BRI)
 and in the Western provinces
 Brewers' Distributor&#160;Ltd. (BDL). BRI and BDL are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The majority of ownership in BRI resides with MCC

 MCC uses jointly-owned distribution systems to deliver beer to on-premise customers along with products from Labatt Breweries of Canada LP and Sleeman Breweries Ltd.
 and other small participating brewers. In Quebec and Eastern Canada
 MCC primarily delivers directly. The on-premise channel

The off-premise channel includes sales to convenience stores
 grocery stores
 liquor stores and other specialty retail outlets

In Ontario
 beer is primarily purchased at retail outlets operated by BRI
 at government-regulated retail outlets operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario
 at approved agents of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario
 at certain licensed grocery stores
 or at any bar
 restaurant
 or tavern licensed by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario to sell alcohol for on-premise consumption. The BRI retail outlets operate under The Beer Store name. Brewers may deliver directly to BRI's outlets or may choose to use BRI's distribution centers to access retail stores in Ontario
 the Liquor Control Board of Ontario system
We
 together with certain other brewers
 have historically participated in the ownership of BRI in proportion to provincial market share relative to other brewers in the ownership group. Effective January 1
 2016
 we
 along with the other owners of BRI and the Province of Ontario
 agreed to revise the ownership structure of BRI. The new BRI shareholder agreement (&#8220;New Shareholder Agreement&#8221;) adjusted the existing BRI ownership structure to allow all other small and large Ontario based brewers the ability to participate in the ownership of BRI. As part of this change
 the board of directors of BRI has been expanded to include representation for these new ownership groups
 as well as independent director representation. The new owners are subject to the same fee structure as the current owners
 with the exception of smaller brewers
 who have discounted fees
 as they are not required to fund certain costs associated with pension obligations. BRI operates on a cash neutral basis under the new ownership structure. BRI also converted all existing capital stock into a new share class
 as well as created a separate new share class to facilitate new and existing brewer participation and governance. While governance and board of director participation continues to have the ability to fluctuate based on market share relative to the other owners
In Qu&#233;bec
 the distribution and sale of beer is governed by the Quebec Alcohol Corporation (SAQ). Beer is distributed to retail outlets directly by each brewer or through approved independent agents. We are the agent for the licensed brands we distribute. The brewer or agent distributes the products to permit holders for retail sales for on-premise consumption. Qu&#233;bec retail sales for off-premise consumption are made through grocery and convenience stores
In British Columbia
 the government's Liquor Distribution Branch controls the regulatory elements of distribution of all alcohol products in the province. BDL
 which we co-own with ABI
 manages the distribution of our products throughout British Columbia. Consumers can purchase beer at any Liquor Distribution Branch retail outlet
In Alberta
 the distribution of beer is managed by independent private warehousing and shipping companies or by a government sponsored system in the case of U.S. sourced products. All sales of liquor in Alberta are made through retail outlets licensed by the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission or licensees
 such as bars
Our products are distributed in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan through local liquor boards. Manitoba and Saskatchewan also have licensed private retailers. BDL manages the distribution of our products in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In the Maritime Provinces (other than Newfoundland)
 local liquor boards distribute and sell our products. In Yukon

Manufacturing
We source barley malt from one primary provider
 from which we have a committed supply through 2021. Hops are purchased from a variety of global suppliers in the U.S. and Europe through contracts that vary in length based on market conditions and cover our supply requirements through 2019. Other starch brewing adjuncts are sourced from two main suppliers
We operate seven breweries
 strategically located throughout Canada. These locations brew and package all owned and certain licensed brands sold in
 and exported from
 Canada. See Item&#160;2
We single source glass bottles and have a committed supply through December 2019. We source lids and cans from two primary providers with contracts ending February 2017 and December 2023. We currently utilize a hedging program for aluminum requirements and related transportation and storage costs in Canada. The distribution systems in each province generally provide the collection network for returnable bottles and aluminum cans. The standard bottle for beer brewed in Canada is the 341 ml returnable bottle and represents the vast majority of our bottle sales. Bottle sales continue to decline as we have experienced a shift in consumers' preference toward aluminum cans. This standard returnable bottle requires significant investment behind our returnable bottle inventory and bottling equipment. Therefore
 the trend away from returnable bottles could result in higher fixed cost deleverage related to these assets and an ultimate decreased need for the assets that support this packaging
 which could adversely impact profitability. A limited number of kegs are purchased every year
December 2018. Paperboard and labels are currently sourced from one supplier with contracts through December 2017 and December 2021

The Canadian brewing industry is a mature market and ABI and MCBC are the two largest brewers. It is characterized by aggressive competition for volume and market share from regional brewers
 microbrewers and certain foreign brewers
 as well as our main domestic competitor. These competitive pressures require significant annual investment in marketing and selling activities. In 
There are three major beer price segments: above premium
 which includes craft and most imports; premium
 which includes the majority of domestic brands and the light sub-segment; and value (below premium). Since 2001

Our brands compete with competitor beer brands and other alcohol beverages

The Canada brewing industry is composed principally of two major brewers
 MCBC and ABI. The following table summarizes the estimated percentage share of the Canadian beer market represented by MCBC
The decrease in MCBC's share in 2015 was largely driven by the loss of the contract with Miller Brewing Company (Miller)
brands in Canada and was terminated effective March 2015. As a result of the Acquisition
October&#160;11

 beer is generally distributed through either a two-tier system consisting of manufacturers and retailers
 or a three-tier system consisting of manufacturers
 distributors and retailers. Distribution activities for both the on-premise and off-premise channels are conducted primarily by third-party logistics providers. Most of our beer in the U.K. is sold directly to retailers. We have an agreement with Tradeteam Ltd. (Tradeteam
 a subsidiary of DHL) to provide the distribution of our products throughout the U.K. through 2023. We utilize several hundred third-party logistics providers across our Central European operations. We also conduct a small amount of secondary distribution in Czech Republic utilizing our own fleet of vehicles. It is also common in the U.K. for brewers to distribute beer
 wine
 spirits
other companies
 which we refer to as factored brands
&#32;represented factored brands. In addition
 we have an agreement with Heineken through December 2019
 whereby they sell
In Europe
 the on-premise channel includes sales to pubs and restaurants. The installation and maintenance of draught beer dispensing equipment in the on-premise channel is generally the responsibility of the brewer. Accordingly
 we own refrigeration units and other equipment used to dispense beer from kegs to consumers that are used in on-premise outlets. This includes beer lines
 cooling equipment
 taps
The off-premise channel includes sales to supermarkets
 convenience stores
 liquor stores
 distributors
 and wholesalers. The off-premise channel has become increasingly concentrated among a small number of super-store chains
Generally
 over the years
 volumes in Europe have shifted from the higher margin on-premise channel
 where products are consumed in pubs and restaurants
 to the lower margin off-premise channel
 also referred to as the take-home market. In 2016
 approximately 40% of sales were on-premise and 60% were off-premise. Consistent with prior years
Similar to other brewers
 we utilize loans in securing supply relationships with customers in the on-premise market in the U.K. These loans can be granted at below-market rates of interest
 with the outlet purchasing beer at lower-than-average discount levels to compensate. We reclassify a portion of sales revenue to interest income to reflect the economic substance of these loans. See Part&#160;II&#8212;Item&#160;8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

In Europe
 the beer industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations primarily influenced by holidays
 weather and by certain major televised sporting events. Weather conditions consisting of high temperatures and extended periods of warm weather favor increased consumption of our products
 while unseasonably cool or wet weather
 especially during the summer months
 adversely affects our sales volumes and net sales. Accordingly
 the peak selling seasons typically occur during the summer and during the Christmas and New Year holiday season. 
 driven by decreased beer consumption versus last year in some of the largest regions in which we operate. Since 2010
 the off-premise market share has increased in our European markets from 55% to nearly 60% of total volume
 and the on-premise market share has declined from 45% to approximately 40%. Europe beer industry retail shipments have declined by approximately 1% to 2% yearly since 2011

 prior to the segment change discussed below. The MCI portfolio of beers competes within the above-premium category in most of our markets. Our principal competitors include large global brewers
 as well as local brewers. As MCI's objective is to grow and expand our business
 we are developing scale and building market share in the countries where we operate. Many of the markets in which we operate are considered emerging beer markets
 with other brewers controlling the majority of the market share. Our beers compete not only with similar products from competitors
 but also with other alcohol beverages
 including wines
 spirits
 and ciders
 and thus our competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories. Effective January 1

 a complete prohibition of the sale and consumption of all forms of alcohol in the state of Bihar was implemented. The expected length of the prohibition is unclear but we continue to monitor legal proceedings impacting the regulatory environment as it relates to our ability to resume operations in the state. As a result of this ban

 our 2020 Sustainability Strategy integrates how we manage energy
 greenhouse gas emissions
 water and solid waste and sets out how we intend to meet our 2020 ambitions. The cornerstone of our 2020 Sustainability Strategy is a commitment to invest in waste water treatment and generate clean energy from this waste stream. These investments will alleviate the impact of our operations on municipal water treatment resources
Our operations are subject to a variety of extensive and changing federal
 state and local environmental laws
 regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse effects on human health or the environment. Such laws
 regulations or ordinances may impose liability for the cost of remediation

Investing in our Company involves risk. The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks set forth below are those that management believes are most likely to have a material adverse effect on us

 financial condition or results of operations in future periods. If the following risks or uncertainties
 individually or in combination
 actually occur
 they may have a material adverse effect on our business
The success of the Acquisition will depend
 in part
 on our ability to realize anticipated cost and operational synergies. Our success in realizing these cost synergies
 and the timing of this realization
 depends on the successful integration of our business and operations with the acquired business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the acquired businesses and operations successfully
The Acquisition subjects us to significant additional liabilities
We have assumed all of the liabilities of MillerCoors
 including
 among others
 significant pension and other post-employment benefit liabilities. The assumed liabilities put additional pressure on our ability to successfully meet our deleveraging commitments and grow our business over time as discussed further below. In addition
 as a result of the Acquisition
 we are subject to the risks of the U.S. beer market to a much greater extent
 and a significant majority of our overall business is in mature
 low growth beer markets
 such as the U.S.
&#32;brand portfolio
 and we cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term
 or at all. Integrations of acquired businesses are complex
 costly
 and time-consuming
 and such activities divert management&#8217;s time and attention. The assumption of liabilities in the Acquisition
 coupled with any delays
 additional costs
 or issues experienced during the integration period could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
We raised significant capital to fund the Acquisition
 including the issuance of our 2016 Notes
 as defined in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 and the borrowings on our term loan completed in October 2016
 in addition to our Class B common stock offering completed in February 2016. Ratings agencies may downgrade our credit ratings below their current investment grade levels if we are unable to meet our deleveraging commitments. A ratings downgrade could increase our costs of future borrowing and harm our ability to refinance our debt in the future on acceptable terms or access the capital markets. We currently intend to hold per share dividends constant and have suspended both our dividend target of 18% to 22% of trailing annualized EBITDA and our share repurchase program. We also intend to use cash from operations to reduce our debt level
&#32;brand portfolio from ABI at a time when it had no access to historical financial statements which were then in the possession of SABMiller. Accordingly

 financial condition
The global beer industry is constantly evolving
 and our position within the global beer industry and our markets in which we operate may fundamentally change. If we do not successfully transform along with the evolving industry and market dynamics
The brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years becoming an increasingly global beer market. For many years
 the industry operated primarily on local presence with modest international expansion achieved through export
 license and partnership arrangements
 whereas it has now become increasingly complex as the consolidation of brewers has occurred globally resulting in fewer major global market participants. At the same time
 smaller local brewers within certain geographies are seeing accelerated growth as consumers increasingly place value on&#160;locally-produced and/or regionally-sourced products.&#160;As a result of the increased global consolidation of brewers and the dynamic of an expanding new segment within the industry with new market entrants
 the markets in which we operate
 particularly the more mature markets
 may evolve at a disadvantage to our current market position and local governments may intervene
 which may fundamentally accelerate transformational changes to such markets. For example
 U.S. and Canada beer markets have long consisted of a select number of significant market participants with government-regulated routes to market.&#160;However
 recent evolution in these markets and emerging changes to consumer preferences have introduced a significant expansion of market entrants and resulted in increased consumer choice and market competition
 as well as increased government scrutiny.&#160;Specifically
 in the U.S.
 we have experienced vast expansion in the craft beer industry and have accordingly strategically acquired several craft breweries in the recent year. If our competitors are able to respond more quickly to the evolving trends within the craft beer industry
 or if our new products are not successful
 our U.S. business may be adversely impacted. In Canada
 changes to regulations
 distribution models
 and packaging requirements
 such as government-owned retail outlets and industry standard returnable bottles may be disadvantageous to us.&#160;Currently
 in Ontario and other provinces
enhance competition and choice.&#160;As further described below
 in addition to these risks related to growing competition and market evolution
 the existing Ontario distribution models may be changed in ways that are unfavorable to us and the industry standard returnable bottle agreement may change in ways that adversely impact our operating model across Canada. If we are unsuccessful in evolving with
 and navigating through
 the changes to the markets in which we operate
Competition in our markets could require us to reduce prices or increase capital and other expenditures or cause us to lose sales volume
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In most of our markets
 our primary competitors have substantially greater financial
 marketing
 production and distribution resources than we do
 and are more diverse in terms of their geographies and brand portfolios. In all of the markets in which we operate
 aggressive marketing strategies
 such as reduced pricing
 brand positioning
 and increased capital investments by these competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition
 continuing consolidation among major global brewers may lead to stronger or new competitors
 loss of partner brands
 negative impacts on our distributor networks and pressures from marketing and pricing tactics by competitors. Further
 distributor consolidation could reduce our ability to promote our brands in the market in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes their value
 as well as reduce our ability to manage our pricing effectively. Failure to generate significant cost savings and margin improvement through our ongoing initiatives could adversely affect our profitability and these factors could result in lower margins or loss of market share
 due to increased pressures for reduced pricing or difficulties in increasing prices while remaining competitive within our markets
 as well as the need for increased capital investment
 marketing and other expenditures. Moreover
 most of our major markets are mature
 so growth opportunities may be more limited to us than to our competitors. For example
&#32;of our total 2016 sales. The above risk
 if realized
Our success as an enterprise depends largely on the success of relatively few products in several mature markets specific to the beer industry; if consumer preferences shift away from our products or consumption of our products decline
&#32;brands in the U.S.
Coors Light
&#32;brands
&#32;in Canada
Carling

 Jelen
brands in Europe represented approximately half of each respective segment's sales volumes in 2016. Additionally
 several of our brands represent a significant share of their respective market
 therefore volatility in these markets could disproportionately impact the performance of these brands. Consequently
 any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands
 or from the categories in which they compete
 could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from our brands or beer generally due to
 among others
 changing taste preferences
 demographics
 downturn in economic conditions or perceived value
 as well as changes in consumers' perception of our brands due to negative publicity
 regulatory actions or litigation. Recently
 there has been more attention focused on the health concerns and harmful effects of alcoholic beverages which could result in a change in the social acceptability of beer and other alcoholic beverages which could materially impact our sales. Additionally
 in some of our major markets
 specifically Canada and the U.S.
 there has been a recent shift in consumer preferences within the total beer market away from premium brands to craft beer produced by small
 regional microbreweries
 as well as a shift within the total alcohol beverage market from beer to wine and spirits. Moreover
 several of our major markets are mature and we have significant share
 therefore small movements in consumer preference can disproportionately impact our results. As a result
The success of our business relies heavily on brand image
 reputation
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is important that we maintain and increase the image and reputation of our existing products. Concerns about product quality
 even when unsubstantiated
 could be harmful to our image and reputation of our products. While we have quality control programs in place
 in the event we experienced an issue with product quality
 we may experience recalls or liability in addition to business disruption which could further negatively impact brand image and reputation. Deterioration to our brand equity may be difficult to combat or reverse and could have a material effect on our business and financial results. In addition
 because our brands carry family names
 personal activities by certain members of the Molson or Coors families that harm their public image or reputation could have an adverse effect on our brands. Further
 our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights
 including trademarks
 patents
 domain names
We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate these rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights
Continued weak
 or further weakening of
Difficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets
 such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income driven by increases to inflation
 income taxes
 the cost of living
 unemployment levels
 political or economic instability or other country specific factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. For example
 we have continued to experience economic pressures in certain European markets
 resulting in an increased consumer trend toward value brands within the impacted markets. A continuation of this trend or further deterioration of the current economic conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A significant portion of our consolidated net sales revenues will be concentrated in the U.S. Therefore
 unfavorable macroeconomic conditions
 such as a recession or slowed economic growth
 in the U.S. could negatively affect consumer demand for our product in this important market. Under difficult economic conditions
Our debt level
 which increased significantly in 2016 to fund the Acquisition
 subjects us to financial and operating risks
Our indebtedness subjects us to financial and operating covenants
 including restrictions on priority indebtedness
 leverage thresholds
 liens
 certain types of secured debt and certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets
 which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement
 we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default would adversely affect our credit ratings
 may allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness
Our significant debt level and the terms of such debt could
&#32;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;debt
 thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions
 working capital
&#32;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;activities
limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital
 capital expenditures
&#32;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;opportunities
 including acquisitions or other investments
 to fund growth or for general corporate purposes
&#32;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity
Under the terms of each of our debt facilities
 we must comply with certain restrictions. These include restrictions on priority indebtedness (certain threshold percentages of secured consolidated net tangible assets)
 leverage thresholds
 liens
 and restrictions on certain types of sale lease-back transactions and transfers of assets. Failure to comply with these restrictions or maintain our credit rating may result in issues with our current financing structure and potential future financing requirements. A deterioration in our credit rating could also affect our ability to obtain future financing or refinance our current debt
 as well as increase our borrowing rates
As part of our risk management activities
 we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments
 including
 among others
 forward contracts
 commodity swap contracts
 option contracts
 with various financial institutions. In addition
 we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result
 we are exposed to the risk of default by
 or failure of
 counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy
proceedings. In the event of default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties
 we could incur significant losses
Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
 most significantly the Canadian dollar and the European operating currencies such as
 Euro
 British Pound
 Czech Koruna
 Croatian Kuna
 Serbian Dinar
 New Romanian Leu
We hold assets and incur liabilities
 earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies
 most significantly in Canada and throughout Europe. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars (USD)
 we must translate our assets
 liabilities
 income and expenses into USD. Increases and decreases in the value of the USD will affect
 perhaps adversely
 the value of these items in our financial statements
 even if their local currency value has not changed. Additionally
 we are exposed to currency transaction risks related to transactions denominated in currencies other than one of the functional currencies of our operating entities
 such as the purchase of certain raw material inputs or capital expenditures
 as well as sales transactions and debt issuances or other incurred obligations. Further
 certain actions by the government of any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results and financial position. To the extent that we fail to adequately manage these risks through our risk management policies intended to protect our exposure to currency movements
 which may affect our operations
 including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates
 our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. As a result the U.K. vote to leave the European Union
 the GBP experienced a significant decline in comparison to USD and EUR and continues to be volatile. Any significant further weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Additionally
 the recent strengthening of the USD against the Canadian dollar
 European currencies and various other global currencies
 if continued
Our operations face significant exposure to changes in commodity prices
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials
 some of which are purchased through supply contracts with third parties
 to produce our products
 including barley
 malted barley
 hops
 corn
 other various starches
 water and packaging materials
 including aluminum cans and bottles
 glass and polyethylene terephthalate (&#8220;PET&#8221;) containers
 as well as
 cardboard and other paper products. We also use a significant amount of diesel fuel
 natural gas and electricity in our operations. The supply and price of these raw materials and commodities can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control
 including market demand
 alternative sources for suppliers
 global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices and the resulting impact on diesel fuel prices)
 trade agreements among producing and consuming nations
 governmental regulations
 including tariffs
 frosts
 droughts and other weather conditions
 economic factors affecting growth decisions
 inflation
 plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the availability or prices of ingredients or packaging or our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks and we are not able to pass these increased costs along to customers
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In connection with various business combinations
 we have historically allocated material amounts of the related purchase prices to goodwill and other intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite useful lives. For example
 as a result of the Acquisition
&#32;and $7.7 billion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
 respectively. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually
 using estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions and changes in operating performance. Additionally
 in conjunction with the brand impairment tests
 we also reassess each brand's indefinite-life classification. Potential resulting charges from an impairment of goodwill or brand intangible
 as well as reclassification of an indefinite-lived to a definite-lived brand intangible
 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example
October&#160;1
 2016
brand indefinite-lived intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result
&#32;recorded within special items in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally
 during this review
Our most recent impairment analysis
October&#160;1
 2016
 the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter
 indicated that the fair value of our Canada reporting unit declined from the prior year
 while our Europe reporting unit fair value remained comparable with the prior year
 and therefore continues to be considered at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Specifically
&#32;in excess of their carrying values
 respectively. The Europe reporting unit is therefore at risk of a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged
 or further weakening of
 adverse economic conditions or significant unfavorable changes in tax
 environmental or other regulations
thereof)
 terminal growth rates
 market transaction multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis. Although the fair value in excess of the carrying value has increased for the Canada reporting unit from the October 1
 2015
 testing date
 the fair value is sensitive to potential unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows
 macroeconomic conditions
 market multiples or discount rates that could have an adverse impact. Any future impairment of the Europe or Canada reporting units or brands
 or reclassification of indefinite-lived brands to definite-lived
 may result in material charges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally
&#32;global business is unsuccessful due to
 for example
 unexpected challenges or difficulties
 or adverse economic
 market or industry conditions
 material impairment charges may be incurred in the future. The testing of our goodwill for impairment is predicated upon our determination of our reporting units. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test.

Note 11
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We manufacture and/or distribute products of other beverage companies through various joint venture
 licensing
 distribution
 contract brewing or other similar arrangements. The loss of one or more of these arrangements
 as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise
 could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example
brands in the U.K. Additionally
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We purchase certain types of packaging materials including aluminum cans and bottles
 glass bottles and paperboard from a small number of suppliers. Consolidation of packaging materials suppliers has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of supply disruptions. The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally
 if the financial condition of these suppliers deteriorates our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our suppliers&#8217; financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control
 including competitive and general market conditions in the locations in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes
 work stoppages
&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We have entered into several joint ventures
 including our joint ventures with Ball Corporation
 Rocky Mountain Metal Container
 and with Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc.
 Rocky Mountain Bottle Company
 for a portion of our aluminum and glass packaging supply in the United States. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic
 business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. In addition
 we compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. Our joint venture arrangements may require us
 among other matters
 to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner's consent to take certain actions. In addition
 our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents
 and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture. For example
 we terminated our MMI joint venture that imported
 distributed and marketed the Modelo beer brand portfolio across all Canadian provinces and territories
 which
 since termination in the first quarter of 2014
 has had an adverse effect on our Canadian volumes and financial results. The above risk
 if realized
brand portfolio outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico. In certain of these markets
 we have limited operating experience and may not succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section
 our operations in these markets expose us to additional risks
 including: changes in local political
 economic
 social and labor conditions; restrictions on foreign ownership and investments; repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.; import and export requirements; increased costs to ensure compliance with complex foreign laws and regulations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment
 which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; longer payment cycles
 increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; and other challenges caused by distance
 language
In addition
 as a global company
 we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption
 including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties
 criminal sanctions against us
 our officers
 or our employees
 prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries
 each of which could have a materially negative effect on our brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations
 including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act
 there can be no assurance that our employees
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many countries in which we operate regulate the distribution of alcohol products and if those regulations were changed
 it could alter our business practices and have material adverse effects on our business and financial results. For example
 in the U.S. market
 there is a three-tier distribution system that governs the sale of malt beverage products. That system
 consisting of required separation of manufacturers
 distributors and retailers
 dates back to the repeal of prohibition and is periodically subject to legal challenges. To the extent that such challenges are successful and allow changes to the three-tier system
 such changes could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. segment results of operations. Further
 in Canada
 our products are required to be distributed through each province's respective provincial liquor board. Additionally
 in certain provinces
 we rely on our joint venture arrangements
 such as BRI and BDL
 to distribute our products via retail outlets that are mandated and regulated by provincial government regulators. BRI owns and operates commercial retail outlets
 known as The Beer Store
 in Ontario
 and BDL facilitates the distribution of our products in the Western provinces. If provincial regulation should change
Changes in tax
 environmental
 trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our business is highly regulated by national
 state
 provincial and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding such matters as tariffs
 licensing requirements
 trade and pricing practices
 labeling
 advertising
 promotion and marketing practices
 relationships with distributors
 environmental matters
 smoking bans at on-premise locations and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent re-evaluation
&#32;in the fourth quarter of 2016. If these assessments are upheld in full or in part
 in addition to potentially recording an additional charge
 we would be subject to increased taxes on future sales of our products
 which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and operating income.&#160;In addition
 U.S. legislative initiatives to reform U.S. tax law could have a material impact on our tax rate and our cash tax expectations
 including our expected cash tax benefits related to the Acquisition. Modifications of U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment (including trade agreements and tariffs) could adversely affect our supply chain
 business and results of operations.&#160;Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws
 regulations
 or interpretations thereof
 or in tax
 environmental
 excise tax levels imposed or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss
 revocation or suspension of our licenses
 permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. Additionally
 uncertainties exist with respect to adding new tax laws
 the interpretation of
 and potential future developments in
 complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income.&#160;Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements
 differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made
 or future changes to such assumptions
 could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Finally
 advocates of prohibition and other severe restrictions on the marketing and sales of alcohol are becoming increasingly organized and coordinated on a global basis
 seeking to impose laws or regulations or to bring actions against us
alcohol
 including beer
 in developed and developing markets. To the extent such views gain traction in regulations of jurisdictions in which we do or plan to do business
 they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example
 in early 2016
 the government of Bihar
 India
 the largest state in India in which MCI operates
 announced a complete prohibition on the sale and distribution of alcohol
 which if not reversed
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in global weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of beer
 changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities
 such as hops
 barley and other cereal grains
 which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities
 disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition
 public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy
 transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Clean water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and climate change may increase water scarcity and cause a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain brewing operations. The competition for water among domestic
 agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in some of our brewing communities. Even where water is widely available
 water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations. The above risks
 if realized
Loss or closure of a major brewery or other key facility
 due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise
Our business and financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes
 hurricanes
 floods
 other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy one of our breweries or key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. Additionally
 certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies
 which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. In addition
 our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity
 including contract brewing and effect on priority of our brands if production capacity is limited. Further
 significant excess capacity at any of our breweries as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines
 could result in under-utilization of our assets
 which could lead to excess overhead expenses or additional costs incurred associated with the closure of one or more of our facilities. For example
 as part of a strategic review of our supply chain network
Failure to successfully identify
We have made a number of acquisitions and entered into several joint ventures. In order to compete in the consolidating global brewing industry
 we anticipate that we may
 from time to time
 in the future acquire additional businesses or enter into additional joint ventures that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business such as the Acquisition. See above Risks Specific to the Acquisition for further details. Potential risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures could include
 among other things: our ability to identify attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to offer potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners' competitive transaction terms; our ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to finance attractive acquisitions and joint ventures; our ability to realize the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition or joint venture; diversion of management's attention; our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of the acquired company; motivating
 recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards
 controls
 procedures and policies
 business cultures and compensation structures among our company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining sales
 marketing and corporate operations; potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies; loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition or entry into a joint venture. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations
Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect our business
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors
 such as the rates of return on the plans' assets
 discount rates
 the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans
 exchange rate fluctuations
 future government regulation
 global equity prices
 and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. While we comply with the minimum funding requirements
funding requirements may also require contributions even when there is no reported deficit. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets
 and depending upon the other factors as listed above
 we could be required to fund the plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations (or the timing of such contributions) could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows
 credit rating and cost of borrowing
 financial position and/or results of operations. For example
 following the completion of the triennial review of the U.K. pension plan with the plan's trustees in 2014
&#32;contribution to our U.K. pension plan in January 2015
We depend on key personnel
The loss of the services and expertise of any key employee could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify
 attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price
 our results of operations and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition
 we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization
 or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition
 in order to achieve our operating objectives
Due to a high concentration of workers represented by unions or trade councils in Canada
 Europe
 and at MillerCoors in the U.S.
 we could be significantly affected by labor strikes
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Approximately 50%
 28% and 36% of our Canadian
 U.S. and European workforces
 respectively
 are represented by trade unions. Stringent labor laws in certain of our key markets expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions in that market. A prolonged labor strike
 work stoppage or other employee-related issue
 could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example
 early in the first quarter of 2017
Because of our reliance on third-party service providers and internal and outsourced systems for our information technology and certain other administrative functions
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We rely extensively on information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network
 help desk
 hardware and software configuration. Additionally
 we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology
 including the internet and third-party hosted services
 to support a variety of business processes and activities
 including procurement and supply chain
 manufacturing
 distribution
 invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits
 as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting
 legal and tax requirements. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting
 human resources and other information technology functions to third-party service providers. As information systems are critical to many of our operating activities
 our business may be impacted by system shutdowns
 service disruptions or security breaches. Additionally
 if one of our service providers was to fail and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner
 we could be unable to properly administer our outsourced functions. Further
 our internal and outsourced systems may also be the target of a breach to our security
 which
 if successful
 could expose us to the loss of key business
 employee
 customer or vendor information and disruption of our operations. If our information systems suffer severe damage
 disruption or shutdown and our remediation plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner
 we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture
 distribute
 invoice and collect payments from our customers. Misuse
 leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations
 or damage our reputation and credibility. In addition
If the Pentland Trust and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders or if a super-majority of our board of directors do not agree on certain actions
 generally the matter will not be approved
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (the Pentland Trust) (a company controlled by the Molson family and related parties) and the Adolph Coors
 Jr. Trust (the Coors Trust)
 which together control more than 90% of our Class&#160;A common stock and Class&#160;A exchangeable shares
 have a voting trust agreement through which they have combined their voting power over the shares of our Class&#160;A common stock and the Class&#160;A exchangeable shares that they own. In the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors)
 the voting trustees are required to vote all of the Class&#160;A common stock and Class&#160;A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trust against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreement to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore
 if either the Pentland Trust or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a proposal that is subject to a stockholder vote
the proposal even if our board of directors
 management or other stockholders believe the proposal is beneficial to us. Similarly
 our bylaws require the authorization of a super-majority (two-thirds) of the board of directors to take certain transformational actions. Thus
&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over certain company actions requiring stockholder approval
 which could have a material adverse effect on Class B stockholders. See Part&#160;II-Item&#160;8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Note 8
Our U.S. business is highly dependent on independent distributors to sell our products
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We sell nearly all of our products
 including all of our imported products
 in the United States to independent distributors for resale to retail outlets. These independent distributors are entitled to exclusive territories and protected from termination by state statutes and regulations. Consequently
 if we are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors
 our business
 financial position and results of operation may be adversely affected
Craft breweries continue to expand in capacity
 geographic and in their brand options while distributors and retailers are making more shelf space available for these expanding craft beer brands. With the continued growth of the craft industry in the U.S. market
 we may not remain competitive and relevant with our product offerings and related innovations. An inability to remain competitive
 could adversely impact our results of operations and market share. Additionally
 due to competition with brewers and other alternative beverage companies in the U.S.
 an increase in the purchasing power of our large competitors
 may cause further pricing pressures which could prevent us from increasing prices to recover higher costs necessary to compete. Such pressures
The alcoholic beverage industry is regularly the subject of anti-alcohol activist activity related to the health concerns from the misuse of alcohol and concerns regarding underage drinking and exposure to alcohol advertisements. Negative publicity regarding beer and changes in consumer perceptions in relation to beer and other alcoholic beverages
 could adversely affect the sale and consumption of our products which could adversely affect our business and financial conditions. Additionally
 the concerns around alcohol
 could result in advertising
 selling and other restrictions imposed by regulators. Moreover
 it could result in increased taxes associated with alcohol sales
 which could also negatively impact our business
 results of operations
We may experience adverse effects on our Canada business and financial results due to declines in the overall Canadian beer industry
 continued price discounting
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the Canadian beer market continues to decline
 the impact to our financial results could be exacerbated due to our significant share of the overall market. Additionally
 continuation
 acceleration or the increase of price discounting
 in Ontario
 Qu&#233;bec
 Alberta or other provinces
 as well as increases in our cost of goods sold
 could adversely impact our business. Further
 changes in the Canadian tax legislation
 such as the potential for an increase in beer excise taxes
 could decrease our net sales. Moreover
 the future success and earnings growth of the Canada business depends
 in part
In the event that we are required to move away from the industry standard returnable bottle we use today
Along with ABI and other brewers in Canada
&#32;of total volume sales (excluding imports) in Canada. Changes to the Industry Standard Bottle Agreement could impact our use of the industry standard returnable bottle. If we cease to use the industry standard returnable bottle
&#32;of our consolidated net sales in 2016 came from the U.K.
 which is our largest market in Europe. In a referendum held on June 23
 2016
 a majority of voters in the U.K. voted in favor of the U.K. leaving the European Union. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union triggered a decline in the GBP in comparison to USD and EUR. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm the beer business
 and if such conditions emerge in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe
 it may have a material adverse effect on our Europe segment. In addition
 any significant further weakening of the GBP to the USD will have an adverse impact on our European revenues as reported in USD due to the importance of U.K. sales. Negotiations on exit terms may take two years to complete once the U.K. formally initiates its exit from the European Union and negotiations on new trade agreements may take longer. The U.K. will remain a member of the European Union until then and will be bound by its legal and treaty obligations. Because of the uncertain terms of the exit
Our European businesses have been
 and may continue to be
 adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and general economic and political conditions
 as well as a continued weakening of their respective currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally
 we face intense competition in certain of our European markets
 particularly with respect to price
 which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. In particular
 the on-going focus by large competitors in Europe to drive increased market share through aggressive pricing strategies could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition
 in recent years
 beer volume sales in Europe have been shifting from pubs and restaurants (on-premise) to retail stores (off-premise) as well as from premium or core brands to value brands
 for the industry in general. Margins on sales of value brands and sales to off-premise customers tend to be lower than margins on sales to on-premise customers
 and
 as a result
Our ability to grow our MCI segment in emerging markets depends on social
 economic and political conditions in those markets
 on our ability to create effective product distribution networks and consumer brand awareness in new markets and in many cases our ability to find appropriate local partners. Due to product price
 local regulatory changes
 local competition from competitors that are larger and have more resources than we do and cultural differences
 or absence of effective routes to market
 there is no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging market. If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging markets
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 2006
 we sold our 83% ownership interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza&#160;S.A. de C.V. (FEMSA). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for exposures related to certain tax
 civil and labor contingencies and certain purchased tax credits. The ultimate resolution of these claims is not under our control. These indemnity obligations are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets
 however
 we could incur future statement of operations charges as facts further develop resulting in changes to our estimates or changes in our assessment of probability of loss on these items as well as due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to the uncertainty involved in the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies

 a notice of action captioned David Hughes and 631992 Ontario Inc. v. Liquor Control Board of Ontario
 Brewers Retail Inc.
 Labatt Breweries of Canada LP
 Molson Coors Canada and Sleeman Breweries Ltd. No. CV-14-518059-00CP was filed in Ontario
 Canada in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Brewers' Retail&#160;Inc. (BRI) and its owners
 including Molson Coors Canada
 as well as the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) are named as defendants in the action. The plaintiffs allege that The Beer Store (retail outlets owned and operated by BRI) and LCBO improperly entered into an agreement to fix prices and market allocation within the Ontario beer market to the detriment of licensees and consumers. The plaintiffs seek to have the claim certified as a class action on behalf of all Ontario beer consumers and licensees and
 among other things
 damages in the amount of Canadian Dollar (CAD) 1.4 billion. We note that The Beer Store operates according to the rules established by the Government of Ontario for regulation
 sale and distribution of beer in the province. Additionally
 prices at The Beer Store are independently set by each brewer and are approved by the LCBO on a weekly basis. Accordingly
 we intend to vigorously assert and defend our rights in this lawsuit. See Part&#160;II&#8212;Item&#160;8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

We use certain operational measures
 such as sales-to-wholesalers (&#8220;STWs&#8221;) and sales-to-retailers (&#8220;STRs&#8221;)
 which we believe are important metrics.&#160;STW is a metric that we use in our U.S. business to reflect the sales from our operations to our direct customers
 generally wholesalers.&#160;We believe the STW metric is important because it gives an indication of the amount of beer and adjacent products that we have produced and shipped to customers. STR is a metric that we use in our Canada and U.S. businesses to refer to sales closer to the end consumer than STWs
 which generally means sales from our wholesalers or our company to retailers
 who in turn sell to consumers.&#160;We believe the STR metric is important because

 which was in-line with the mainstream lager market in U.K. which has declined approximately 5% compared to 2015. Despite this
&#32;global volume on a pro forma basis was relatively consistent in 2016 versus 2015
 as lower volumes in the U.S. and Canada were nearly offset by strong performance in Europe and MCI. Volumes in the U.S. were lower than prior year; however
 the brand gained share of the premium light segment for the seventh consecutive quarter. The declines in Canada were the result of ongoing competitive pressures in Quebec as well as a shift in preference to value brands in the West resulting from a weaker economy; however

 including royalty volume
 decreased by 3.7% during 2016 versus 2015
 primarily driven by lower volumes in Czech Republic and the Ukraine
As a result of the Acquisition
 we aligned our volume reporting policies resulting in adjustments to our historically reported volumes. Specifically
 financial volume for all consolidated segments has been recast to include contract brewing and wholesaler non-owned brand volumes (including factored brands in Europe and non-owned brands distributed in the U.S.)
 as the corresponding sales are reported within our gross sales amounts. Additionally
 financial volumes continue to include our owned beer brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographic markets
 net of returns and allowances. Worldwide beer volume reflects only owned beer brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographic markets
 net of returns and allowances
As outlined above
 worldwide beer volume (including adjacencies
 such as cider and hard soda) is comprised of our owned beer brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographic markets
 net of returns and allowances (financial volume

 royalty volume and our proportionate share of equity investment worldwide beer volume. Financial volume represents owned beer brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographical markets
 net of returns and allowances as well as contract brewing
 wholesale non-owned brand volume and company-owned distribution volume. Royalty beer volume consists of our brands produced and sold by third parties under various license and contract-brewing agreements and because this is owned volume
 it is included in worldwide beer volume. Equity investment worldwide beer volume represents our ownership percentage share of volume in our subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method

On a reported basis
 depreciation and amortization expense was 
 an increase of 
 primarily due to the incremental depreciation and amortization recorded for the U.S. segment from October 11
 2016
 through December 31
 2016
 as a result of the Acquisition. On a pro forma basis
 2016 depreciation and amortization of approximately $850 million was consistent with prior year
 excluding the higher accelerated depreciation expense recorded within special items
 net in 2016 compared to 2015 related to the closure of the Eden
 North Carolina
 brewery. On a reported basis
 depreciation and amortization expense was 
 a slight increase of 
 primarily due to increased amortization of our intangible assets as a result of reclassifying certain brands in our Europe segment to definite-lived in the third quarter of 2015 as well as accelerated depreciation related to bottling line and announced brewery closures
 partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.
. The increase in the effective income tax rate for 2016 versus 2015 was primarily driven by higher pretax income in 2016 resulting from the Acquisition related remeasurement gain on our previously held equity interest in MillerCoors
 along with the inclusion of 100% of MillerCoors' pretax income following the completion of the Acquisition
core brands intangible asset to the Canadian ordinary income tax rate upon reclassification from indefinite-lived to definite-lived assets subject to amortization. Our effective income tax rates in 2015 and 2014 were significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower effective income tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses
 driven by lower statutory income tax rates and tax planning impacts on statutory taxable income. In addition
 during 2015 and 2014
Our tax rate is volatile and may move up or down with changes in
 among other things
 the amount and source of income or loss
 our ability to utilize foreign tax credits
 excess tax benefits from share-based compensation
 changes in tax laws
 and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire
 positions are effectively settled
 or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions in which we do business that
 if enacted
 may have an impact on our effective tax rate. Additionally
 our effective tax rates prior to October 11
 2016
 do not incorporate the effects of the Acquisition
 which were a driver of the increase to our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016
 and which we expect will result in an increase to our effective tax rate on a go-forward basis as a result of the incremental 58% interest in the results of MillerCoors subject to U.S. federal and state income tax. See Part&#160;II&#8212;Item&#160;8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Our ongoing assessment of our supply chain strategies continued in 2016 in order to align with our cost saving objectives. As part of this process
 in October 2015
 we entered into an agreement to sell our Vancouver brewery for CAD 185.0 million
 with the intent to use the proceeds from the sale to help fund the construction of an efficient and flexible brewery in British Columbia. The sale was completed on March 31
 2016. Subsequently
 during the third quarter of 2016
 we completed the purchase of land in British Columbia for the site of the new brewery. We believe the decision to sell the brewery will help optimize the western Canada brewery network and allow for greater flexibility and future cost savings. Further
 in conjunction with the sale of the Vancouver brewery
 we agreed to leaseback the existing property to continue operations on an uninterrupted basis while the new brewery is being constructed. We also expect to incur significant capital expenditures associated with the construction of the new brewery

 announced plans to ban the sale of country liquor and to limit the sale of other forms of alcohol
 such as beer

 four days after the start of the ban on country liquor
 the government of the state of Bihar announced immediate changes to the ban

 our Molson Coors Cobra India business is currently not operating and is idled pending any future change in law or regulation. This ban does not impact our Mount Shivalik business operating outside of Bihar
 India. Due to this triggering event

 we performed an interim impairment assessment for the impacted tangible assets

 MCBC issued the 2016 Notes in order to partially fund the financing of the Acquisition. This issuance resulted in total proceeds of approximately $6.9 billion
 net of underwriting fees and discounts of $36.5 million and $17.7 million
 respectively. Total estimated amounts capitalized in connection with the 2016 Notes
 including underwriting fees
 discounts as well as other financing related costs
 were approximately $65 million and will be amortized over the terms of the 2016 Notes. The 2016 Notes began accruing interest upon issuance
 with semi-annual payments due on the USD Notes and CAD Notes in January and July beginning in 2017
As a result of the issuance of our 2016 Notes
 we terminated our outstanding 364-day bridge loan agreement concurrent with the receipt of these proceeds. There were no outstanding borrowings on the bridge loan upon termination. We also had a term loan agreement to partially fund the Acquisition that provided access to a total term loan commitment of up to $1.5 billion in a 3-year tranche and up to $1.5 billion in a 5-year tranche
 for an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.0 billion. On October&#160;11
 2016
 in connection with the closing of the Acquisition
 we borrowed $1.0 billion under the 3-year tranche and $1.5 billion under the 5-year tranche

 we were required to early terminate these swaps at the approximate time we issued the previously forecasted debt. At the time of issuance of the 2015 Notes
 the government of Canada bond rates were trading at a yield lower than that locked in by the interest rate swaps
 resulting in an aggregate loss of CAD 39.2 million ($29.5 million at settlement)
 which was recorded in other comprehensive income and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the associated note. During 2014
 we also entered into interest rate swaps to economically convert our fixed rate $500 million 3.5% notes due 2022 to floating rate debt. Additionally
 in the first quarter of 2015
 we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and a cross currency swap with a notional amount of EUR 265 million ($300 million upon execution) to economically convert our fixed rate $300 million 2.0% notes due in 2017 to floating rate
 Euro denominated debt. During the fourth quarter of 2015
 we voluntarily cash settled all of our interest rate swaps which resulted in cash receipts of $18.8 million as well as our cross currency swap which resulted in cash receipts of $16.0 million.

Foreign exchange risk is inherent in our operations primarily due to the significant operating results that are denominated in currencies other than USD. Our approach is to reduce the volatility of cash flows and reported earnings which result from currency fluctuations rather than business related factors. Therefore
 we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to foreign currency fluctuations. Our financial risk management policy is intended to offset a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share.

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements
 we are required to make judgments and estimates that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on historical experience
 current trends and various other assumptions we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. We review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly
 including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates
 to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. However
 due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates

Our defined benefit pension plans cover certain current and former employees in the U.S.
 Canada
 the U.K. (within our Europe segment) and Japan (within our MCI segment). Benefit accruals for the majority of employees in our U.S. plan have been frozen and the plans are closed to new entrants. In the U.S.
 we also participate in
 and make contributions to
 multi-employer pension plans. Our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans provide medical benefits for retirees and their eligible dependents as well as life insurance and
 in some cases
 dental and vision coverage
 for certain retirees in Canada
 the U.S. (MillerCoors and Corporate)
 and Europe. The U.S.
 Canada and U.K. defined benefit pension plans are primarily funded
Accounting for pension and OPEB plans requires that we make assumptions that involve considerable judgment which are significant inputs in the actuarial models that measure our net pension and OPEB obligations and ultimately impact our earnings. These include the discount rate
 long-term expected rate of return on assets
 compensation trends
 inflation considerations
 health care cost trends and other assumptions
Specifically
 the discount rates
 as well as the expected rates of return on assets and plan asset fair value determination
 are important assumptions used in determining the plans' funded status and annual net periodic pension and OPEB benefit costs. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. We also
 with the help of actuaries
 periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors
 such as retirement age
 mortality and turnover
 and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate
The assumed discount rates are used to present-value future benefit obligations based on each plan's respective duration. Our pension and postretirement discount rates are based on our annual evaluation of high quality corporate bonds in the various markets based on appropriate indices and actuarial guidance. We believe that our discount rate assumptions are appropriate; however

The assumed long-term expected return on assets (&#8220;EROA&#8221;) is used to estimate the actual return that will occur on each individual funded plan's respective plan assets in the upcoming year. We determine each plan's EROA with substantial input from independent investment specialists
 including our actuaries and other consultants. In developing each plan's EROA
 we consider current and expected asset allocations
 historical market rates as well as historical and expected returns on each plan's individual asset classes. In developing future return expectations for each of our plan's assets
 we evaluate general market trends as well as key elements of asset class returns such as expected earnings growth
includes inputs for interest
 inflation
 credit
 and risk premium (active investment management) rates and fees paid to service providers. Based on the above factors and expected asset allocations
 we have assumed
 on a weighted-average basis
. We believe that our EROA assumptions are appropriate; however
To compute the expected return on plan assets
 we apply the EROA to the market-related value of the pension plans assets adjusted for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets and projected contributions to the plan assets. We have elected to recognize actual returns on these assets ratably over a five year period when computing our market-related value of plan assets. The unrecognized portion of actual returns on these assets is included in accumulated other comprehensive income. This method has the effect of reducing the impact of market volatility that may be experienced from year to year. Specifically
 while employer contributions and realized gains and losses (such as dividends received or gains and losses on sales of assets) are reflected immediately in the market-related value of assets
 each year's unrealized gains and losses are recognized into the market-related value over five years. Therefore
 significant divergences of actual returns from expected returns may not have an immediate impact on each of our plan's future net periodic pension costs; rather
 such differences will be recognized into the market-related value over the five years
 following the event. Therefore
&#32;(and at October 11
 2016
We recognize our defined benefit pension plans as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on their underfunded or overfunded status as of our year end and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur within other comprehensive income. Our funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is measured as the difference between each plan's projected benefit obligation (&#8220;PBO&#8221;) and its assets' fair values. The fair value of plan assets is determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However
 considerable judgment is required in selecting an appropriate methodology and interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value
Equity assets are diversified between domestic and other international investments. Relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. See Part&#160;II&#8212;Item&#160;8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Note 15
December&#160;31
Our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are also influenced by the potential amortization (or non-amortization) from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of deferred gains and losses
 which occur when actual experience differs from estimates. We employ the corridor approach for determining each plan's amortization. This approach defines the &#8220;corridor&#8221; as the greater of 10% of the PBO or 10% of the market-related value of plan assets (as discussed above) and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants. For our closed plans
 the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants (including retirees) is used. If our actuarial losses significantly exceed this corridor in the future
 significant incremental pension and postretirement costs could result. As of year end 
 the deferred losses of several of our Canadian plans
 as well as those in our U.K. plan
The assumed health care cost trend rates represent the rates at which health care costs are assumed to increase and are based on actuarial input and consideration of historical and expected experience. We use these trends as a significant assumption in determining our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense of our postretirement health care plan. We believe that our health care cost trend rate assumptions are appropriate; however

Contingencies

 environmental and litigation reserves are recorded
 when probable
 using our best estimate of loss. This estimate
 involving significant judgment
 is based on an evaluation of the range of loss related to such matters and where the amount and range can be reasonably estimated. These matters are generally resolved over a number of years and only when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Following our initial determination
 we regularly reassess and revise the potential liability related to any pending matters as new information becomes available. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP
 environmental and legal costs are expensed when incurred. We disclose pending loss contingencies when the loss is deemed reasonably possible
 which requires significant judgment. As a result of the inherent uncertainty of these matters
 the ultimate conclusion and actual cost of settlement may materially differ from our estimates. We recognize contingent gains upon the determination that realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt
 regardless of the perceived probability of a favorable outcome prior to achieving that assurance. In the instance of gain contingencies resulting from favorable litigation
 due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in a legal proceeding
 gain contingencies resulting from legal settlements are not recognized in income until cash or other forms of payment are received. If significant and probable

Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment
 or a business unit one level below that operating segment
 for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. As of the date of our annual impairment test
 performed as of October 1
 the operations in each of the specific regions within our Canada
 Europe and MCI segments are components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. Therefore
 the components within each respective segment must be evaluated for aggregation to determine if the components have similar economic characteristics. As a result
 in certain cases
 we have aggregated business units
 within an operating segment
 into one reporting unit if the specific aggregation criteria under U.S. GAAP is met. Specifically
 we have concluded that the components within the Canada and Europe segment each meet the criteria as having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the Canada and Europe reporting units
 respectively. Therefore
 the Canada and Europe reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. However
 for our India business
 the reporting unit is one level below the MCI operating segment. Any change to the conclusion of our reporting units or the aggregation of components within our reporting units could result in a different outcome to our annual impairment test. As of the date of our annual impairment test

 following the completion of the Acquisition on October 11
 2016
We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that would indicate that impairment may have taken place. Our annual impairment test was performed as of October 1
Our annual evaluation involves comparing each reporting unit's fair value to its respective carrying value
 including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds carrying value
unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value
 a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. This step
 if required
 would include valuing all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit
 excluding goodwill. Then
goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill were to exceed the implied fair value of the goodwill
We use a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units
 and an excess earnings approach to determine the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our discounted cash flow projections include assumptions for growth rates for sales
 costs and profits
 which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans of each reporting unit or each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Additionally
 discount rates used in our goodwill analysis are based on weighted-average cost of capital
 driven by the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate
 as well as the credit ratings
 financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit
 among other factors. Discount rates for the indefinite-lived intangible analysis by brand largely reflect the rates supporting the overall reporting unit valuation but may differ slightly to adjust for country or market specific risk associated with a particular brand. Our market-based valuations utilize earnings multiples of comparable public companies
 which are reflective of the market in which each respective reporting unit operates
Changes in the factors used in our fair value estimates
 including declines in industry or company-specific beer volume sales
 margin erosion
 termination of brewing and/or distribution agreements with other brewers
 and discount rates used
&#32;annual goodwill impairment testing determined that the fair value of our Canada reporting unit declined from the prior year
 largely due to continued economic and competitive challenges negatively impacting our business
&#32;core brands as further discussed below. Our Europe reporting unit fair value remained comparable with the prior year
 and continues to be considered at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Specifically

 in addition to the fair value of the reporting unit benefiting from improved cost savings estimates and favorable tax rate changes
 which positively impacted the forecasted future cash flows for the Europe reporting unit. While the fair value of our Canada reporting unit declined from the prior year

As of the date of our annual impairment test

 or further weakening of
 adverse economic conditions or significant unfavorable changes in tax
 environmental or other regulations
 including interpretations thereof)
 terminal growth rates
 market transaction multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. For testing purposes
 management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. Current projections used for our Europe reporting unit testing reflect continued challenging environments in the future followed by growth resulting from a longer term recovery of the macroeconomic environment
 as well as the benefit of anticipated cost savings and specific brand-building and innovation activities. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result
 there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows
 specifically
 a decrease in sales volume and increase in costs that could significantly impact our immediate and long-range results
 a decrease in sales volume driven by a prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends
 a continuation of the trend away from core brands in certain of our markets
 especially in markets where our core brands represent a significant portion of the market
 unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets
 (ii)&#160;adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a recession or worsening of the overall European economy)
 (iii)&#160;volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital
 (iv) sensitivity to market multiples; and (v) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing

 we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items
 as well as related potential implications
 as part of our annual assessment and incorporate into the analyses as appropriate.&#160;These facts and circumstances are subject to change and may impact future analyses.

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business
 there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally
We are periodically subject to tax return audits by both foreign and domestic tax authorities
 which can involve questions regarding our tax positions. Settlement of any challenge resulting from these audits can result in no change
 a complete disallowance
 or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits. We measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our estimated liabilities related to these matters are adjusted in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled
 the statute of limitations for examination expires or when additional information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits requires the use of assumptions and significant judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income
 including the reversal of existing temporary differences
 historical and projected operating results
 and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of tax benefits is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount
 an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period a determination was made. Likewise
 should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future
In February 2016
issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance
 lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
 measured on a discounted basis
 at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally
 this guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases
 including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance should be applied under a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the adoption-period financial statements. Any leases that expire before the initial application date will not require any accounting adjustment. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those annual periods
In May 2014
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. The guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements which are intended to help financial statement users better understand the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue being recognized. Subsequent to the release of this guidance
 the FASB has issued additional updates intended to provide interpretive clarifications and to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue recognition standard both at transition and on an ongoing basis. The new standard and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within that annual reporting period. Upon adoption of the new standard
 the use of either a full retrospective or cumulative effect transition method is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact this new guidance will have on our financial statements and do not anticipate early adoption. We have not completed this evaluation and therefore
 cannot conclude whether the guidance will have a significant impact on our financial statements at this time. However
 based on preliminary work completed
 we are considering the implications that the new standard may have on our contract brewing arrangements
 presentation of certain customer related trade spend
 as well as the timing of recognition of certain promotional discounts
 which are areas that could potentially be impacted by the adoption of the new guidance. We currently anticipate that we will utilize the cumulative effect transition method

 as well as the tax effect of the other pro forma adjustments impacting pretax income discussed above

In the normal course of business
 we actively manage our exposure to various market risks by entering into various supplier-based and market-based hedging transactions
The counterparties to our market-based transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We perform assessments of their credit risk regularly. Our market-based transactions include a variety of derivative financial instruments
Due to the completion of the Acquisition on October 11
 2016
December&#160;31
. As we previously accounted for our 42% interest in MillerCoors as an equity method investment
 the related exposures are not included as of December 31
 2015. Further
 in order to finance the Acquisition
December&#160;31
We are exposed to volatility in interest rates with regard to current and future debt offerings. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates
 Canadian government rates and LIBOR. To mitigate this exposure as it pertains to future debt offerings and to achieve our desired fixed-to-floating rate debt profile
We use commodities in the production and distribution of our products. To manage the related price risk for these costs
 we utilize market-based derivatives and long-term supplier-based contracts. Our primary objective when entering into these transactions is to achieve price certainty for commodities used in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders

The preparation
 integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and all other financial information included in this annual report are the responsibility of the management of Molson Coors Brewing Company. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
December&#160;31
. In making this assessment
. Based upon its assessment
 management concluded that
December&#160;31
 2016
 the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. We acquired full control of MillerCoors LLC on October 11
 2016
 upon completion of the Acquisition. As such
 the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control over financial reporting at MillerCoors LLC. This exclusion is consistent with the SEC Staff's guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition. MillerCoors LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary and represented 68% of the Company's total consolidated assets and 32% of the Company's consolidated net sales as of and for the year ended December 31
 2016
PricewaterhouseCoopers&#160;LLP
 the Company's independent registered public accounting firm
 provides an objective
 independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. Their accompanying report is based upon an examination conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
 including tests of accounting procedures
The Board of Directors
 operating through its Audit Committee composed of independent
 outside directors
 monitors the Company's accounting control systems and reviews the results of the Company's auditing activities. The Audit Committee meets at least quarterly
 either separately or jointly

December&#160;31
December&#160;31
 2015
December&#160;31
&#32;in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition
 in our opinion
 the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly
 in all material respects
 the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion
 the Company maintained
 in all material respects
December&#160;31
 2016
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule
 for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
 included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
 on the financial statement schedule
 and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
As described in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A
 management has excluded MillerCoors LLC from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2016 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2016. We have also excluded MillerCoors LLC from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. MillerCoors LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net sales represent 68 percent and 32 percent
 respectively
 of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31

On November 11
 2015
 Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (&#8220;ABI&#8221;) announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SABMiller plc (SABMiller) (&#8220;ABI/SABMiller transaction&#8221;) and concurrently
 on November 11
 2015
 we entered into a purchase agreement (as amended
 the Purchase Agreement) with ABI to acquire
 contingent upon the closing of the ABI/SABMiller transaction
&#32;voting interest in MillerCoors and all trademarks
&#32;in cash
October&#160;11
 2016
 the Acquisition was completed and MillerCoors
 previously a joint venture between MCBC and SABMiller
 became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC. Accordingly
October&#160;11
 2016
&#32;economic ownership interest in MillerCoors was accounted for under the equity method of accounting
 and
 therefore
 its results of operations were reported as equity income in MillerCoors in the consolidated statements of operations
&#32;share of MillerCoors' net assets were reported as investment in MillerCoors in the consolidated balance sheets. Beginning October 11
 2016
 MillerCoors was fully consolidated and continues to be reported as our U.S. segment. Additionally
 our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31
 2016
 includes our acquired assets and liabilities
Note 4
Unless otherwise indicated
 information in this report is presented in U.S. dollars (USD or $) and comparisons are to comparable prior periods. Our primary operating currencies
 other than USD
 include the Canadian Dollar (CAD)
 the British Pound (GBP)
 and our Central European operating currencies such as the Euro (EUR)
 Czech Koruna (CZK)
Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.&#160;GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates
 judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates
 judgments and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable
 based on information available at the time they are made. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results
Our net sales represent the sale of beer and other malt beverages (including adjacencies
 such as cider and hard soda) net of excise taxes
 the vast majority of which are brands that we own and brew ourselves. We import or brew and sell certain non-owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. In addition
 we contract manufacture for other brewers in some of our markets
Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership
 including the risk of loss
 are transferred to the customer or distributor depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms. The cost of various programs
 such as price promotions
 rebates and coupon programs are treated as a reduction of sales. In certain of our markets
 slotting or listing fees are paid to customers and are also treated as a reduction of sales. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms. Sales are stated net of incentives
We do not have standard terms that permit return of product; however
In addition to supplying our own brands
 the U.K. business (within our Europe segment) sells other beverage companies' products to on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. We refer to this as the factored brand business. Sales from this business are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold.  In the factored brand business
 we normally purchase inventory
 which includes excise taxes charged by the vendor
 take orders from customers for such brands
 and invoice customers for the product and related costs of delivery. In accordance with guidance pertaining to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent
Payments made to customers are conditional on the achievement of volume targets
 marketing commitments
 or both. If paid in advance
&#32;years). Where there is no sufficiently separate identifiable benefit
 and the payment is linked to volumes
 or fair value cannot be established
 the amortization of the prepayment or the cost as incurred is included in sales discounts as a reduction to sales and where there are specific marketing activities/commitments
 the cost is included as marketing

 loans are extended to a portion of the retail outlets that sell our brands. We reclassify a portion of beer revenue to interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these loans. In fiscal years 
 
 these amounts were 
 
 and 
 respectively
Excise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on beer shipments. Excise taxes on beer shipments are shown in a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of sales. Excise taxes are recognized as a liability
Our cost of goods sold includes costs we incur to make and ship beer. These costs include brewing materials
 such as barley
 hops and various grains. Packaging materials
 such as glass bottles
 aluminum cans
 cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Additionally
 our cost of goods sold include both direct and indirect labor
 shipping and handling including freight costs
 utilities
 maintenance costs
 warehousing costs
 purchasing and receiving costs
 depreciation
 promotional packaging
 other manufacturing overheads and costs to purchase factored brands from suppliers
Marketing
Our marketing
 general and administrative expenses include media advertising (television
 radio
 digital
 print)
 tactical advertising (signs
 banners
 point-of-sale materials) and promotion costs on both local and national levels within our operating segments. The creative portion of our advertising activities is expensed as incurred. Production costs of advertising and promotional materials are expensed when the advertising is first run. Marketing
 general and administrative expenses also include acquisition and integration costs of 
 respectively
This classification includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance
 legal
 human resources and information technology
 along with acquisition and integration costs as noted above
 which consist primarily of labor and outside services
 as well as bad debt expense related to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP
 legal costs are expensed when incurred. These costs also include our marketing and sales organizations
 including labor and other overheads. This line item additionally includes amortization costs associated with intangible assets
Share-based compensation is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period of the awards. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. Our share-based compensation plan and the awards within it contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon change in control
 retirement
the award is no longer contingent on providing service
 which for certain awards can result in immediate recognition for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or accelerated recognition for awards granted to individuals that will become retirement eligible within the stated vesting period. Also
 if less than the stated vesting period
Our special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that either we do not believe to be indicative of our core operations
 or we believe are significant to our current operating results warranting separate classification; specifically
infrequent or unusual items
impairment or asset abandonment-related losses
restructuring charges and other atypical employee-related costs
The items classified as special items are not necessarily non-recurring
 however
 they are deemed to be incremental to income earned or costs incurred by the company in conducting normal operations
On October 11
 2016
 following the close of the Acquisition
 MillerCoors became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC and as a result
&#32;of the outstanding equity and voting interests of MillerCoors. Prior to October 11
 2016
 MCBC's equity income in MillerCoors represented our proportionate share for the period of the net income of our investment in MillerCoors accounted for under the equity method. This amount reflected adjustments to eliminate intercompany gains and losses
 and to amortize
 if appropriate
Interest Expense
Our interest costs are associated with borrowings to finance our operations. In addition to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents across our business
 interest income in the Europe segment is associated with trade loans receivable from customers
 primarily in the U.K. As noted above
 this includes a portion of beer revenue which is reclassified to interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these loans. Changes in estimates (if any) to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest liabilities
 which are presented within other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet
&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Our other income (expense) classification primarily includes gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to brewing and selling beer. For instance
 aggregate unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement and settlement of foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities
 as well as certain gains or losses on sales of non-operating assets are classified in this line item. These gains and losses are reported in the operating segment in which they occur; however
 foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances are reported within the Corporate segment. The initial recording of foreign-denominated transactions are classified based on the nature of the transaction
 with the unrealized or realized foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the subsequent remeasurement of the monetary asset or liability
 and its ultimate settlement
Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets
 liabilities
 and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We apply the intraperiod tax allocation rules to allocate our provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings
 such as discontinued operations and other comprehensive income (loss) when we meet the criteria prescribed by the guidance. We provide for taxes that may be payable if undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries were to be remitted to the U.S.
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest
Other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) represents income and losses for the reporting period
 including the related tax impacts
 which are excluded from net income (loss) and recognized directly within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) as a component of equity. OCI also includes amounts reclassified to income during the reporting period that were previously recognized within AOCI. Amounts remaining within AOCI are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI in the future
 at which point they will be recognized within the consolidated statement of operations as a component of net income (loss). We recognize OCI related to the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than USD
 unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion of our derivatives designated in cash flow and net investment hedging relationships
 actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
 as well as our proportionate share of our equity method investments' OCI. Additionally
 we do not have the expectation or intent to cash settle certain of our intercompany note receivable and note payable positions in the foreseeable future; therefore
Cash consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with multiple
Supplementary cash flow includes non-cash issuances of share-based awards. We also have non-cash investing activities related to movements in our guarantee of indebtedness of certain equity method investments
&#32;related to the receipt of a note upon the sale of our U.K. malting facility in 2015. In addition
 total Acquisition consideration also includes non-cash investing activity related to the issuance of replacement share-based compensation awards

We record accounts and notes receivable at net realizable value. This carrying value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts and notes receivable balances. We calculate this allowance based on our country-specific history of write-offs
 level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with and the economic status of our customers

 which are kept on hand for repairs and maintenance of machinery and equipment. The majority of spare parts within our business include motors
 fillers and other components that are required to maintain a normal level of production in the event that expected maintenance and/or repairs are required. These parts are inventoried within current assets as they are reasonably expected to be used during the normal operating cycle of the business and are reserved for excess and obsolescence

Properties are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
&#32;years. Land is not depreciated
 and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Costs of enhancements or modifications that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated accordingly. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss

Returnable containers are recorded at acquisition cost and consist of returnable bottles
 kegs
 pallets and crates that are both in our direct control within our breweries
 warehouses and distribution facilities and those that we indirectly control in the market through our agreements with our customers and other brewers and for which a deposit is received. The deposits received on our returnable containers in the market are recorded as deposit liabilities
 included as current liabilities within accounts payable and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We estimate that the loss

The costs of acquiring or developing internal-use computer software
 including directly-related payroll costs for internal resources
Properties held under capital lease are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term
 whichever is shorter
Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment
 or a business unit one level below that operating segment
 for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. As of the date of our annual impairment test
 performed as of October 1
 the operations in each of the specific regions within our Canada
 Europe and MCI segments are considered components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. We have concluded that the components within the Canada and Europe segments each meet the criteria as having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the Canada and Europe reporting units
 respectively. Additionally
 we determined that the components within our MCI segment do not meet the criteria for aggregation with the exception of the operations of our India businesses
 which constitute a separate reporting unit. As required
&#32;owned investments where we exercise significant influence or VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We use the cumulative earnings approach for determining cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investees. Distributions received are included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities
 unless the cumulative distributions exceed our portion of the cumulative equity in the net earnings of the equity method investment

We use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest
 foreign currency exchange
 commodity
 production and packaging material costs and for other strategic purposes related to our core business. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only
 including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize our derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value and are classified in either current or non-current assets or liabilities based on each contract's respective unrealized gain or loss position and each contract's respective maturity. Our policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis
 without regard to counterparty master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Further
 our current derivative agreements do not allow us to net positions with the same counterparty and therefore
Changes in fair values (to the extent of hedge effectiveness) of outstanding cash flow and net investment hedges are recorded in OCI
 until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the underlying hedged item or the sale of the underlying net investment
 respectively. Effective cash flow hedges offset the gains or losses recognized on the underlying exposure in the consolidated statements of operations
 or for net investment hedges
We record realized gains and losses from derivative instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Changes in unrealized gains and losses for derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recorded directly in earnings each period and are also recorded in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Cash flows from the settlement of derivatives
 including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships
In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance
 we do not record the fair value of derivatives for which we have elected the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exemption. We account for these contracts on an accrual basis
We maintain retirement plans for the majority of our employees. We offer different types of plans within each segment
 including defined benefit plans
 defined contribution plans and other postretirement benefit plans (OPEB). Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. Our equity investments
 BRI and BDL
 maintain defined benefit
We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur within OCI. The funded status of a plan
 measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation
to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensation
 if applicable
We employ the corridor approach for determining each plan's potential amortization from AOCI of deferred gains and losses
 which occur when actual experience differs from estimates
&#32;of the market-related value of plan assets and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants. For plans closed to new entrants and the future accrual of benefits
The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value as recorded due to the short-term nature of these instruments. In addition
 the carrying amounts of our trade loan receivables

U.S. GAAP guidance for fair value includes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach
Level&#160;2&#8212;Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets

In March 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify and improve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The guidance includes amendments that require excess tax benefits or deficiencies resulting from share-based payments be recognized in the income statement as a component of the provision for income taxes
 whereas previously these were recognized within additional paid-in-capital. Further
 the new guidance provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new standard also amends the presentation of employee share-based payment-related items in the statement of cash flows by requiring that: (i) excess tax benefits be classified as cash inflows provided by operating activities (MCBC previously included within cash flows from financing activities)
 and (ii) cash paid to taxing authorities arising from the withholding of shares from employees be classified as cash outflows used in financing activities (MCBC previously included within cash flows from operating activities). We early adopted this guidance during the quarter ended September 30
December&#160;31
 2016
benefits generated during 2016 being recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes as opposed to additional paid-in-capital. The amendments also impacted our calculation of diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method
 as excess tax benefits and deficiencies resulting from share-based payments are no longer included in the assumed proceeds calculation. These provisions of the new guidance have been adopted on a prospective basis as of January 1
 2016
 which is the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. As permitted by this standard
 the Company has elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. The cash flow impacts of the adoption of this guidance were applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. These impacts resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities

Note 20
In August 2016
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The amendment addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. We have early adopted this guidance effective for our year ended December 31
In January 2017
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance
 the recognition of an impairment charge is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value; however
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis
 and is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1
In February 2016
issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance
 lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
 measured on a discounted basis
 at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally
 this guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases
 including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance should be applied under a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the adoption-period financial statements. Any leases that expire before the initial application date will not require any accounting adjustment. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those annual periods
In July 2015
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify the measurement of inventory. The amendment requires entities to measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value
requirement to measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost or market
 which considers replacement cost
 net realizable value
 and net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2016. The amendment should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption of this guidance
In May 2014
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. The guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements which are intended to help financial statement users better understand the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue being recognized. Subsequent to the release of this guidance
 the FASB has issued additional updates intended to provide interpretive clarifications and to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue recognition standard both at transition and on an ongoing basis. The new standard and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within that annual reporting period. Upon adoption of the new standard
 the use of either a full retrospective or cumulative effect transition method is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact this new guidance will have on our financial statements and do not anticipate early adoption. We have not completed this evaluation and therefore
 cannot conclude whether the guidance will have a significant impact on our financial statements at this time. However
 based on preliminary work completed
 we are considering the implications that the new standard may have on our contract brewing arrangements
 presentation of certain customer related trade spend
 as well as the timing of recognition of certain promotional discounts
 which are areas that could potentially be impacted by the adoption of the new guidance. We currently anticipate that we will utilize the cumulative effect transition method
 however
Other than the items noted above
 there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective or adopted in the current year that we believe have a significant impact
 or potential significant impact

The acquisition of MillerCoors was reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a step acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. As such
&#32;equity interest in MillerCoors to fair value as discussed above. The fair value measurement of our previously held equity interest immediately prior to the completion of the Acquisition is based on significant inputs not observable in the market
 and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Specifically
&#32;equity interest in MillerCoors
&#32;purchase price attributable to the Acquisition and the nature of the Acquisition
Under the acquisition method
 MCBC recorded all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition-date fair values. The excess of total consideration
 including the estimated fair value of our previously held equity interest in MillerCoors
 over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. We have completed the preliminary detailed valuation analyses necessary to assess the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized as of the Acquisition date. The amounts shown below for certain assets and liabilities
&#32;equity interest
 are preliminary in nature and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the Acquisition date. Upon completion of detailed valuation analyses

BRI is a beer distribution and retail network for the Ontario region of Canada
 with majority of the ownership residing with MCC
 Labatt Breweries of Canada LP (a subsidiary of ABI) and Sleeman Breweries Ltd. (a subsidiary of Sapporo International). BRI charges its owners administrative fees that are designed so the entity operates on a cash neutral basis. This administrative fee is based on costs incurred
 net of other revenues earned
 and is allocated in accordance with the operating agreement to its owners based on volume of products. Contractual provisions cause participation in governance and other interests to fluctuate based on this calculated market share requiring frequent primary beneficiary evaluations. However
 based on the existing structure
 control is shared
 and remains shared through such changes
 and therefore we do not anticipate becoming the primary beneficiary in the foreseeable future. We consider BRI an affiliate. See Affiliate Transactions section below summarizing our transactions and balances with affiliates
In 2015
 we
 along with the other owners of BRI and the Province of Ontario
 agreed to revise the ownership structure of BRI. The new BRI shareholder agreement (&#8220;New Shareholder Agreement&#8221;) incorporating these changes became effective at the beginning of 2016
 at which time BRI converted all existing capital stock into a new share class
 as well as created a separate share class to facilitate new and existing brewer participation and governance. While governance and board of director participation continues to have the ability to fluctuate based on market share relative to the other owners
 our equity interest has become fixed under the New Shareholder Agreement. We have evaluated the changes within the New Shareholder Agreement from a primary beneficiary perspective and concluded that we will continue to account for BRI as an equity method investment
We have an obligation to proportionately fund BRI's operations. As a result of this obligation
 we continue to record our proportional share of BRI's net income or loss and OCI activity

The increase in the effective income tax rate for 2016 versus 2015 was primarily driven by higher pretax income in 2016 resulting from the Acquisition related revaluation gain discussed above
&#32;of MillerCoors' pretax income following the completion of the Acquisition
 each of which were taxed at the U.S. federal and state income tax rates. Additionally
 deferred tax expense was not required to be recorded on the difference between our historical tax basis in goodwill and the new book basis in goodwill resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in MillerCoors. This resulted in a partially offsetting decrease to the effective tax rate
 which is presented in the Acquisition related permanent items line in the table above
&#32;primarily due to lower effective income tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses
. In addition

MillerCoors continues to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes following the completion of the Acquisition. Accordingly
&#32;deferred tax liability recognized on the fair value remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in MillerCoors. This increase was partially offset by the recognition of deferred tax assets in acquisition accounting related to certain temporary differences associated with the acquired 58% interest in MillerCoors. This increase was also partially offset by the acceleration of taxable income in 2016 related to our investment in MillerCoors
 which was previously deferred
Separately
 during 2016
 we recorded additional tax loss carryforwards in certain European jurisdictions in the aggregate of 
 primarily driven by investment losses recognized based on local statutory accounting requirements. As the carryforwards were generated in jurisdictions where we do not have operations
 we concluded that it was more likely than not that the net operating losses would not be realized
 and thus recorded a full valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets. The recognition of these deferred tax assets and fully offsetting valuation allowance resulted in a zero net impact to the consolidated statement of operations
 balance sheet and statement of cash flows. This valuation allowance increase was partially offset by the release of valuation allowances in certain U.S.
 Canada and European jurisdictions
Our deferred tax valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if
 based upon available evidence
 it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income
 including the reversal of existing temporary differences
 historical and projected operating results and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on this analysis

 under this program
 we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (&#8220;ASRs&#8221;) with a financial institution. In exchange for up-front payments
 the financial institution delivered shares of our common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered
 and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share
 was determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume weighted-average price of our common stock during that period. The up-front payments for the treasury stock were accounted for as a reduction to shareholders&#8217; equity in the consolidated balance sheet in the periods the payments are made. We reflected each ASR as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to our own common stock. Each ASR met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification

 and concluded there were no impairments of goodwill within our Europe
 Canada or India reporting units; however
&#32;core brands impairment
 there were no other impairments of our indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the annual review process. However
 as further discussed below
 we identified a triggering event in our India reporting unit in April 2016
 and as a result
As of the date of our annual impairment test
 performed as of October 1
 2016
 the operations in each of the specific regions within our Canada
 Europe and MCI segments are considered components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. We have concluded that the components within the Canada and Europe segments each meet the criteria as having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the Canada and Europe reporting units
 respectively. Additionally
our MCI segment do not meet the criteria for aggregation
 and therefore
&#32;annual goodwill impairment testing determined that the fair value of our Canada reporting unit declined from the prior year
 largely due to continued economic and competitive challenges negatively impacting our business
&#32;core brands as further discussed below. Our Europe reporting unit fair value remained comparable with the prior year
 and continues to be considered at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Specifically
&#32;in excess of carrying value
 respectively
 as of the October 1
 2016
 testing date. The excess of the fair value over the carrying value of the Europe reporting unit slightly improved from the prior year. The improvement in the current year was driven by a decrease to the carrying value of the reporting unit versus the prior year
 in addition to the fair value of the reporting unit benefiting from improved cost savings estimates and favorable tax rate changes
 which positively impacted the forecasted future cash flows for the Europe reporting unit. While the fair value of our Canada reporting unit declined from the prior year
&#32;core brands impairment charge resulting in a reduction to the overall carrying value of the reporting unit. The Canada reporting unit
 continued to face challenging market dynamics during the year
core brands
 resulting in a reduction of forecasted results in comparison to the prior year
 which were slightly off-set by incremental cost savings initiatives included in the current year forecast. Although the fair value in excess of the carrying value has increased for the Canada reporting unit from the October 1
 2015
 testing date
 the fair value is sensitive to further unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows
 macroeconomic conditions
 market multiples or discount rates that could have an adverse impact. The fair value of the India reporting unit approximated its carrying value
Note 1
During the annual impairment testing as of October 1
 2016
brand indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value
&#32;portfolio. Specific changes included a continued decline in performance throughout 2016 which drove a downward shift in management's forecasts
 a challenging market dynamic and competitive conditions not expected to subside in the near-term
 as well as an increased discount rate. As a result
&#32;core brand impairment during our annual testing
&#32;core brands had characteristics that indicated a definite-life assignment was more appropriate
 including prolonged weakness in consumer demand driven by increased economic and competitive pressures. These factors have resulted in sustained declines in brand performance
 and it is unclear when these ongoing pressures on the brands will subside. These brands were therefore reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets with the remaining aggregate fair value of approximately 
 which equals the carrying value as of October 1
 2016
Our Europe indefinite-lived intangibles' fair values
brands
 continue to be sufficiently in excess of their respective carrying values as of the annual testing date. During 2015 and 2014
 we also recognized impairment charges on certain European indefinite-lived brands of 
 respectively. These brands were reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets as of September 30
 2015
&#32;years. Separately
indefinite-lived brands in the U.S. were recognized at their fair values upon completion of the Acquisition on October 11
We utilized Level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets
As of the date of our annual impairment test
 performed as of October 1
 the Europe reporting unit goodwill is at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged
 or further weakening of
 adverse economic conditions or significant unfavorable changes in tax
 environmental or other regulations
including interpretations thereof)
 terminal growth rates
 market multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. For testing purposes
 management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. Current projections used for our Europe reporting unit testing reflect continued challenging environments in the future followed by growth resulting from a longer term recovery of the macroeconomic environment
 as well as the benefit of anticipated cost savings and specific brand-building and innovation activities. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result
 there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows
 specifically
 a decrease in sales volume and increase in costs that could significantly impact our immediate and long-range results
 a decrease in sales volume driven by a prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends
 a continuation of the trend away from core brands in certain of our markets
 especially in markets where our core brands represent a significant portion of the market
 unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets
 (ii)&#160;adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a recession or worsening of the overall European economy)
 (iii)&#160;volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital
 (iv) sensitivity to market multiples; and (v) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing
Based on known facts and circumstances
 we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items
 as well as related potential implications
While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets in excess of carrying values
 if our assumptions are not realized
Regarding definite-lived intangibles
 we continuously monitor the performance of the underlying asset for potential triggering events suggesting an impairment review should be performed. Excluding the definite-lived intangible asset impairment charge associated with the triggering event which occurred in Bihar
 India further discussed below
. In addition
 no such triggering events were identified in 2015 or 2014
 with the exception of the license agreement litigation settlement with Miller in Canada
In the fourth quarter of 2015
 a newly elected government in the state of Bihar
 India announced plans to ban the sale of country liquor and to limit the sale of other forms of alcohol

 2016. On April 5
 2016
 four days after the start of the ban on country liquor
 the government of the state of Bihar announced immediate changes to the ban
 implementing a complete prohibition of the sale and consumption of all forms of alcohol. Due to this triggering event
 and as the expected length of the prohibition was unclear and was expected to remain in effect for the foreseeable future
 we performed an interim impairment assessment for the impacted tangible assets
 intangible assets and the India reporting unit goodwill. Specifically
 upon identification of the triggering event we completed step one of the goodwill impairment test comparing the fair value of the India reporting unit to its carrying value using a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches
 which resulted in the need to complete step two. Upon completion of step two
 we recorded an impairment of tangible assets of

 largely resulted from the inclusion of the MillerCoors pension and OPEB plans and change in the nature of the global economic environment
The obligations of our defined benefit pension plans in the U.S.
 Canada and the U.K. are supported by assets held in trusts for the payment of future benefits. The business segments are obligated to adequately fund these asset trusts. The underlying investments within our defined benefit pension plans include: cash and short-term instruments
 debt securities
 equity securities
 investment funds
 and other investments including derivatives
Each plan's respective allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given a focus on a long-term time horizon for fulfilling the plans' obligations. All assets are managed by external investment managers with a mandate to either match or outperform their benchmark. The plans use different asset managers in the U.S.
Our investment strategies for our defined benefit pension plans also consider the funding status for each plan. For defined benefit pension plans that are highly funded
 assets are invested primarily in fixed income holdings that have a similar duration to the associated liabilities. For plans with lower funding levels
 the fixed income component is managed in a similar manner to the highly funded plans. In addition to this liability-matching fixed income allocation
 these plans also contain exposure to return generating assets including: equities
 real estate
 debt
 and other investments held with the goal of producing higher returns
Both our U.K. and Canadian plans hedge a portion of the foreign exchange exposure between plan assets that are not denominated in the local plan currency and the local currency as the Canadian and U.K. pension liabilities will be settled in CAD and GBP
December&#160;31
December&#160;31
 2016
However
 we currently have significant plan assets invested in U.K.
Further
 as our benefit plans maintain exposure to non-government investments
 a significant system-wide increase in credit spreads would also negatively impact the reported plan asset values. In general
 equity and fixed income risks have been mitigated by company-specific concentration limits and by utilizing multiple equity managers. We do have significant amounts of assets invested with individual fixed income and hedge fund managers
 therefore
We use a variety of industry accepted valuation techniques to value our plan assets. The techniques vary depending upon instrument type. Whenever possible
 we prioritize the use of observable market data in our valuation processes. We use market
Note 1
December&#160;31
 2016
Cash and short-term instruments&#8212;Includes cash
 trades awaiting settlement
 bank deposits
 short-term bills and short-term notes. Our trades awaiting settlement category includes payables and receivables associated with asset purchases and sales that are awaiting final cash settlement as of year end due to the use of trade date accounting for our pension plans assets. These payables normally settle within a few business days of the purchase or sale of the respective asset. The respective assets are included in or removed from our year end plan assets and categorized in their respective asset categories in the fair value hierarchy below. We include these items in Level&#160;1 of this hierarchy
 as the values are derived from quoted prices in active markets. Short-term instruments are included in Level&#160;2 of the fair value hierarchy as these are highly liquid instruments that are valued using observable inputs
Debt securities&#8212;Includes various government and corporate fixed income securities
 interest and inflation-linked assets such as bonds and swaps
 collateralized securities
 and other debt securities. The majority of the plans' fixed income assets trade on over the counter exchanges
 which provides observable inputs that are the primary data used to determine each individual investment's fair value. We also use independent pricing vendors
 as well as matrix pricing techniques. Matrix pricing uses observable data from other similar investments as the primary input to determine the individual security's fair value. Government and corporate fixed income securities are generally classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using observable inputs. Assets included in our collateralized securities include mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations
Equities&#8212;Includes publicly traded common and other equity-like holdings
NAV per share practical expedient&#8212;Includes our debt funds
 equity funds
 hedge fund of funds
Other&#8212;Includes derivatives
 repurchase agreements
 recoverable taxes for taxes paid and awaiting reclaim due to the tax exempt nature of the pension plan
 venture capital
 and private equity. Derivatives are priced using observable inputs including yields
 interest rate curves and spreads. Exchange traded derivatives are typically priced using the last trade price. Repurchase agreements are agreements where our plan has created an asset exposure using borrowed assets
 creating a repurchase agreement liability
 to facilitate the trade. The assets associated with the repurchase agreement are included in the other category in the fair value hierarchy
 and the repurchase agreement liability is classified as Level&#160;1 in the hierarchy
 as the liability is valued using quoted prices in active markets. When determining the presentation of our target and asset allocations for repurchase agreements
 we are viewing the asset type
 as opposed to the investment vehicle
 and accordingly include the associated assets within fixed income
recoverable tax items in Level&#160;1 of this hierarchy

 the plan liabilities were equal to the plan assets and were included in other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets
We use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
To achieve our objectives
 we enter into a variety of financial derivatives
 including foreign currency exchange
 commodity
While
 by policy
 the counterparties to any of the financial derivatives we enter into are major institutions with investment grade credit ratings of at least A- by Standard&#160;&amp; Poor's (or the equivalent) or A3 by Moody's
 we are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties. This credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts
We have established a counterparty credit policy and guidelines that are monitored and reported to management according to prescribed guidelines to assist in managing this risk. As an additional measure
 we utilize a portfolio of institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries that we conduct our business. In calculating the fair value of our derivative balances
 we also record an adjustment to recognize the risk of counterparty credit and our own non-performance risk
We base the fair value of our derivative instruments upon market rates and prices. The volatility of these rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. The current fair values of our contracts could differ significantly from the cash settled values with our counterparties. As such
We may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date upon the occurrence of certain contractual triggers including a change of control
 termination event or other breach of agreement. This could have a negative impact on our liquidity. For derivative contracts that we have designated as hedging instruments
 early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the forecasted transaction or firm commitment. We may also decide to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date through negotiations with our counterparties
Due to the nature of our counterparty agreements
 we are not able to net positions with the same counterparty across business units. Thus
 in the event of default
 we may be required to early settle all out-of-the-money contracts
We do not receive and are not required to post collateral unless a change of control event occurs. This termination event would give either party the right to early terminate all outstanding swap transactions in the event that the other party consolidates
 merges with
 or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
 another entity
December&#160;31
 2016
Our foreign currency forwards are designated in hedging relationships as cash flow hedges. Prior to settlements discussed below
 our forward starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges
 our interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges and our cross currency swaps were designated as net investment hedges. In certain situations
 we may execute derivatives that do not qualify for
 or we do not otherwise seek
 hedge accounting but are determined to be important for managing risk. For example
 our commodity swaps
Note 4
&#32;were not designated in a hedge accounting relationship. These outstanding economic hedges are measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. We have historically elected to apply the NPNS exemption to certain contracts
We formally document all relationships receiving hedge accounting treatment between hedging instruments and hedged items
 as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions pursuant to prescribed guidance. We also formally assess effectiveness both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis
We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1)&#160;the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a forecasted future transaction; (2)&#160;the derivative expires or is sold
 terminated
When we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively
 but it continues to be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period
 the existing gain or loss on the derivative remains in AOCI for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or in the carrying value of the hedged item for fair value hedges and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However
 if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter
remains outstanding
 we carry the derivative at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheets until maturity
During the first quarter of 2016
&#32;for the option to enter into and exercise swaps with a forward starting effective date. These swaptions were not designated in hedge accounting relationships as the hedges were entered into in association with the Acquisition and
 accordingly
 all mark-to-market fair value adjustments were reflected within interest expense. During the second quarter of 2016
 we terminated and cash settled these swaptions in anticipation of the issuance of the 2016 Notes
Separately
 prior to issuing the EUR Notes and the CAD Notes on July 7
 2016
 we entered into foreign currency forward agreements in the second quarter of 2016 with a total notional amount of EUR 
 representing a majority of the anticipated net proceeds from the issuance of the respective CAD Notes and EUR Notes
 to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of the associated notes against the USD prior to issuance and to convert the proceeds to USD upon issuance through gross settlement. We settled these foreign currency forwards on July 7

Additionally
&#32;private placement notes in Canada
 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in order to manage our exposure to the volatility of the interest rates associated with the future interest payments on the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps had effective dates mirroring the terms of the forecasted debt issuance. Under these agreements we were required to early terminate these swaps at the approximate time we issued the previously forecasted debt. We had designated these contracts as cash flow hedges of a portion of the interest payments on a future forecasted debt issuance. As a result

We received floating interest payments quarterly based on a credit spread plus the three month LIBOR (USD coupon) and paid a floating rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread plus EURIBOR (EUR coupon). As a result of this cross currency swap and the above mentioned interest rate swaps

We have financial commodity swap and option contracts in place to hedge changes in the prices of natural gas

 corn
 barley and diesel. These contracts allow us to swap our floating exposure to changes in these commodity prices for a fixed rate. These contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships. As such
 changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. We hedge forecasted purchases of natural gas up to 
 aluminum up to

 in line with our risk management policy. For purposes of measuring segment operating performance
 the unrealized changes in fair value of the swaps not designated in hedge accounting relationships are reported in Corporate outside of the segment specific operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing is realized. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from Corporate to the operating segment
We utilize market approaches to estimate the fair value of our derivative instruments by discounting anticipated future cash flows derived from the derivative's contractual terms and observable market interest
 foreign exchange and commodity rates. The fair values of our derivatives also include credit risk adjustments to account for our counterparties' credit risk

In 2006
 we sold our entire equity interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza&#160;S.A. de C.V. (FEMSA). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for certain exposures related to tax
 civil and labor contingencies arising prior to FEMSA's purchase of Kaiser. In addition
 we provided an indemnity to FEMSA for losses Kaiser may incur with respect to tax claims associated with certain previously utilized purchased tax credits. We settled a portion of our tax credit indemnity obligation during 2010. The maximum potential claims amount for the remainder of the purchased tax credits (which we believe present less risk than those previously settled)

Our estimates consider a number of scenarios for the ultimate resolution of these issues
 the probabilities of which are influenced not only by legal developments in Brazil but also by management's intentions with regard to various alternatives that could present themselves leading to the ultimate resolution of these issues. The liabilities are impacted by changes in estimates regarding amounts that could be paid
 the timing of such payments
Additionally
 we also provided FEMSA with indemnity related to all other tax

Future settlement procedures and related negotiation activities associated with these contingencies are largely outside of our control. The sale agreement requires annual cash settlements relating to the tax

 and labor indemnities. Indemnity obligations related to purchased tax credits must be settled upon notification of FEMSA's settlement. Due to the uncertainty involved with the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies
 significant adjustments to the carrying values of the indemnity obligations have been recorded to date
 and additional future adjustments may be required. These liabilities are denominated in Brazilian Reais and are therefore
 subject to foreign exchange gains or losses

 we believe that any payments

 for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to our results from operations

 we believe that any reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements
In addition to the specific cases discussed below
 we are involved in other disputes and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings
 in our opinion
 based on a review with legal counsel
 none of these disputes or legal actions are expected to have a material impact on our business

During the fourth quarter of 2014
 and first quarters of 2015 and 2016
 we received assessments from a local country regulatory authority related to indirect tax calculations in our Europe operations during the 
December&#160;31
.&#160;While we continue to challenge the validity of these assessments and defend our position regarding the method of calculation
 if the assessments
 as issued
 are ultimately upheld
 they could materially affect our results of operations
 including excise taxes
 net sales revenue and resulting impacts to other consolidated financial statement line items. Based on the assessments received and related impacts
 we estimate a current range of loss of up to approximately 
December&#160;31
 2016
During the fourth quarter of 2016
 following on-going discussions with the regulatory authority and consideration of existing facts and circumstances
 we have concluded that a portion of this estimated range of loss is deemed probable. As a result
 we recorded a charge of approximately 
 based on foreign exchange rates at December 31
 2016
 within the excise taxes line item on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31
 2016. While this provision was estimated based on the best information available at this time
 significant judgment is required and the ultimate outcome of the assessments is inherently uncertain. Therefore
We continue to follow the required regulatory procedures in order to proceed with our appeal of the assessments and are proactively engaged with the regulatory authority to mutually resolve this matter. The indirect tax calculation methodology challenged in the assessments continues to be applied by us while the regulatory appeal process remains ongoing
 and
 as a result
 the related range of loss is expected to increase until ultimately resolved. Moreover
 if the assessments are upheld in full or in part
 in addition to potentially recording an additional charge
 we would be subject to increased indirect taxes on future sales on an ongoing basis
Separately
 in 2013 we became aware of potential liabilities in several European countries primarily related to local country regulatory matters associated with StarBev Holdings S.a.r.l. (StarBev) pre-acquisition periods. We recorded liabilities related to these matters in the second quarter of 2013 as we finalized purchase price accounting related to the acquisition of StarBev. During the first quarter of 2014
 these matters were favorably resolved and we released the associated indirect-tax and income-tax-related reserves

 Canada. BRI and its owners
 including Molson Coors Canada
 as well as the LCBO are named as defendants in the action. The plaintiffs allege that The Beer Store (retail outlets owned and operated by BRI) and LCBO improperly entered into an agreement to fix prices and market allocation within the Ontario beer market to the detriment of licensees and consumers. The plaintiffs seek to have the claim certified as a class action on behalf of all Ontario beer consumers and licensees and
 among other things
. We note that The Beer Store operates according to the rules established by the Government of Ontario for regulation
 sale and distribution of beer in the province. Additionally
 prices at The Beer Store are independently set by each brewer and are approved by the LCBO on a weekly basis. As such

As a result of our adoption of the FASB's recently issued share-based compensation guidance in the third quarter of 2016
 we recast our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented. The adoption of this guidance also impacted our previously reported quarterly results for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For purposes of this supplemental guarantor information

In conjunction with the issuance of the 2016 Notes

During the fourth quarter of 2016
 we corrected the allocation of income tax expense assigned to the subsidiary guarantors and subsidiary non guarantors to derive equity income (loss) in subsidiaries in 2015 and 2014.

 the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal control over financial reporting at MillerCoors LLC as of December 31

 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that
 by their nature
 can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. Also
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule&#160;13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&#160;pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&#160;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)&#160;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of the inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective due to changes in conditions

 the cash retainer is the fixed amount payable to a director by reason of his or her being a member of the board of directors of MCBC and any committee thereof
 including amounts payable due to chairmanship of the board or a committee
The number of shares of common stock to be issued will be determined by dividing the cash retainer payment due (either 100% or 50% of the cash payment
 depending on the director&#8217;s election) by the fair market value (FMV) of the common stock on that date as determined under the MCBC Incentive Compensation Plan.  Per the Incentive Compensation Plan
If a director has chosen to defer receipt of common stock by electing DSUs
 then instead of issuing the shares
Because DSUs represent a right to receive common stock in the future
 and not actual shares
 there are no voting rights associated with them. However
 cash dividend equivalents will be credited with respect to the DSUs. In the event of an adjustment in MCBC&#8217;s capitalization
The shares of common stock represented by the DSUs will be issued upon a director&#8217;s termination as a member of the Board.  The shares will be issued in a single payout
 no later than thirty days after the director&#8217;s board service terminates.  The shares will be issued to the director&#8217;s brokerage account.  Accrued cash dividend equivalents will be paid at the same time
The following discussion addresses the U.S. and Canadian federal income tax consequences of participation in the Plan
 based upon current laws
 rulings and regulations.  Tax considerations under state
 provincial
 local or other foreign laws
 or laws pertaining to taxes other than income taxes
.  The fair market value of the shares of common stock is taxed as ordinary income in the year received.  Accordingly
 if a director elects to receive common stock currently
 he or she will be taxed currently on the value of the shares on the date issued to the director
.  If a director elects to defer receipt of the common stock by electing DSUs
 he or she will not be taxed currently
 but instead will be taxed at the time in the future when the shares of common stock are issued.  At that time
&#160;- MCBC reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan
 in whole or in part
&#32;MCBC has filed a Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) with respect to the shares of common stock which may be issued under the Incentive Compensation Plan.  Pursuant to the rules of the SEC
 this Summary Description does not contain all of the information set forth in the Registration Statement and exhibits thereto
MCBC will provide
 without charge
 to each person to whom this Summary Description is delivered
 upon written or oral request of such person
In addition
 a copy of MCBC&#8217;s most recent Annual Report to Stockholders accompanies this Summary Description or has been furnished previously.  MCBC will provide to each director who has received this Summary Description copies of all reports
and other communications distributed to its stockholders generally.  In the event a recipient of this Summary Description misplaces any such documents
 another will be furnished
 without charge
 upon written request.  Requests for copies of any of the documents referred to above
 or any questions regarding the Plan or its administration
 should be directed to the office of the Global Chief People Officer
 Molson Coors Brewing Company

 Suite 3200
 Denver
&#32;- The Plan does not apply any specific restrictions on the resale of shares of common stock issued to directors under the Plan.  However
Under the Securities Act
 all directors of MCBC may be deemed to be &#8220;affiliates&#8221; for purposes of the Securities Act.  Sales of common stock by such persons may be deemed to be sales of common stock by MCBC.  Rule 144
 promulgated under the Securities Act
 sets forth a &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; procedures for affiliates to sell shares yet not have the sale be deemed a distribution of common stock on behalf of MCBC.  Rule 144 restricts the number of shares of common stock which may be sold by an affiliate during any 90-day period
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act provides that
 in certain circumstances
 the profit realized by a director on the purchase and sale
 or sale and purchase
 of common stock within a six-month time frame
 is recoverable by MCBC from the affiliate if it is a prohibited &#8220;short-swing profit&#8221;.  Accordingly
.  Molson Coors Brewing Company (MCBC) establishes this Molson Coors Brewing Company Directors' Stock Plan (the Plan) as a Non-Employee Director award under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan subject to the terms and provisions thereof effective July&#160;26
 2006. This plan shall be administered by the Global Chief People Officer of MCBC (the Administrator). The purpose of the Plan is to provide an incentive to certain MCBC directors who are not employees of MCBC to own additional shares of Common Stock of MCBC (Common Stock)
 thereby aligning their interests more closely with the interests of the stockholders of MCBC. The effective date of this amended and restated Plan (the Amended and Restated Plan) shall be May 31
.  Any director of MCBC who is not an employee of MCBC or any of its subsidiaries may elect to participate in the Plan by filing an election with the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 neither the Chairman nor Vice Chairman of the Board shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Elections to participate shall apply to the calendar year commencing after the date the election is filed. Once an election has been filed with the Administrator
 the director shall participate in the Plan for the entire year for which he or she has elected to participate and to the extent provided by the Administrator
 for all subsequent years until the director timely files&#160;a new election for such subsequent year. To be effective
&#160;preceding the year (or such other deadline in such preceding year established by the Administrator) for which it is to take effect. Such election shall become irrevocable on the applicable deadline. In the case of an individual who first becomes an eligible director during a calendar year
 such individual may irrevocably elect to participate for the remainder of such year by filing an election within 30&#160;days of becoming eligible
.  Commencing as of the first day of the year a director elects to participate
 all or 50% (as elected) of the cash retainer amount payable to the director shall be paid in shares of Common Stock until the director shall cease to serve as a member of the MCBC board of directors or until a subsequent year in which the director shall file&#160;a timely new election
 whichever first occurs. Cash retainers for this purpose shall be the fixed amount payable to a director by reason of his or her being a member of the board of directors of MCBC and any committee thereof
 including amounts payable due to chairmanship of the board or a committee
&#32;&#32;Subject to the timing requirements of paragraph&#160;2
 directors who participate in the Plan may elect to defer receipt of their shares of Common Stock otherwise payable under the Plan and
 in lieu thereof
 MCBC shall maintain on its books deferred stock units (DSUs) representing an obligation to issue shares of Common Stock. DSUs shall be credited to the director at the time and in the amount that shares of Common Stock would otherwise have been paid in the absence of an election to defer. As of each of the Company&#8217;s dividend payment dates after the effective date of the Amended and Restated Plan
 each director who has been credited with DSUs shall be credited with a cash amount (a cash dividend equivalent) equal to the aggregate amount of cash dividends
 if any
 that would have been payable on the number of shares of Common Stock that equals the number of DSUs credited to the director (as determined on the applicable dividend payment date)
 including
 for the avoidance of doubt
 DSUs credited to the director prior to the effective date of the Amended and Restated Plan.  Upon the termination of service as a director
 MCBC shall pay to the director in a lump sum (i) one share of Common Stock for each DSU and (ii) an amount of cash equal to the total amount of the director's accrued cash dividend equivalents credited with respect to the DSUs
) day after the director ceases to be a director of MCBC. Ceases to be a director or words of similar import
 as used in this Plan mean
 for purposes of any payments under this Plan that are payments of deferred compensation subject to Code Section&#160;409A
.  Shares paid to directors under the Plan shall be paid with newly issued shares of Common Stock of MCBC
 or treasury shares of Common Stock held by MCBC. No fractional shares shall be issued.  Whenever the computation of the number of shares to be paid results in a fractional amount
&#32;&#32;In the event that any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock occurs by reason of a stock dividend
 stock split
 recapitalization
 merger
 consolidation
 combination
 share exchange or similar corporate change
.  Neither a director nor his or her duly designated beneficiary shall have any right to assign
 transfer
any Common Stock or DSUs hereunder
 and any such attempted assignment
 transfer
.  A director may designate a beneficiary which is to receive any unpaid Common Stock or Common Stock payable with respect to DSUs credited at the director's death. Such designation shall be effective by filing a written notification with the Administrator and may be changed from time to time by similar action. If no such designation is made by a director
 any such balance shall be paid to the director's surviving spouse
 and in the absence of a surviving spouse
.  The Plan may be amended or terminated at any time by action of the Board of Directors of MCBC
 but no amendment shall adversely affect a director's rights with respect to cash retainer payments earned but not yet paid in Common Stock or any DSUs without the director's written consent.

The consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;).  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Given the significance of MillerCoors' financial results to the consolidated results of Molson Coors
 the consolidated financial statements of MillerCoors as of and for the period ended October 10
 2016 are included as an exhibit within Molson Coors' Annual Report on Form 10-K.  All adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of financial results as of and for the period ended October 10
 2016 have been made; however
 those financial results are not comparable with prior fiscal periods.  In addition
 the financial results for the period ended October 10
The Company's fiscal year ends on December&#160;31.  The 2016 financial statements are prepared as of and for the period ended October 10
 2016
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make certain estimates
 judgments and assumptions.  The Company believes that the estimates
 judgments and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable based on information available at the time they are made.  To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results
During the period ended October 10
 2016
The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value.  This carrying value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances.  The Company calculates this allowance based on its history of write-offs

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined by the first-in
 first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) method.  The Company regularly assesses the shelf-life of its inventories and reserves for those inventories when it becomes apparent the product will not be brewed
Property
Property
 plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.  Buildings and improvements and land improvements are depreciated over useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years
 limited to the minimum lease term for leasehold improvements.  Machinery and equipment are depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 25 years.  Containers are depreciated over a useful life of 15 years.  Land is not depreciated
 and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.  The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property
 plant and equipment retired
 or otherwise disposed of
The Company capitalizes the costs of obtaining or developing internal-use computer software
 including directly related payroll costs.  Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software
 ranging from 3 to 8 years.  The cost and related accumulated depreciation of computer software retired
 or otherwise disposed of
 are removed from the consolidated balance sheets.  Any gain or loss is included in earnings.  Internally generated costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are expensed as incurred.  Computer software is classified in property
The Company reviews property
 plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of property
 plant and equipment is measured by comparing the carrying value to the projected undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate.  If such assets are considered to be impaired
Finite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization using a straight-line basis and impairment losses
 if any.  Cost is determined as the amount paid by the Company
 unless the asset has been acquired as part of a business combination.  Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets and is included within marketing
Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements.  See Note 6
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for disclosures related to goodwill impairment testing
 Note 7
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements
&#8221; for disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities
 Note 10
 &#8220;Employee Retirement Plans
&#8221; for disclosures related to pension assets and Note 17
The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at their estimated fair value in its consolidated balance sheets.  The change in a derivative's fair value is recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
 depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and if so
 the type of hedge transaction.  See Note 7
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements
&#8221; and Note 8
 &#8220;Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments
There are certain share-based compensation plans where employees of the Company were granted awards while employed by the Shareholders prior to the formation of the Company.  Compensation cost related to these plans is recognized based on the fair value of the grants at every period end for unvested awards because the employees are earning their share-based compensation while working at the Company.  In addition
 because the Company is an unconsolidated subsidiary of the Shareholders

Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that either the Company does not believe to be indicative of its core operations
 or the Company believes are significant to its current operating results warranting separate classification; specifically
infrequent or unusual items
impairment or asset abandonment-related losses
restructuring charges and other atypical employee-related costs
The items classified as special items are not necessarily non-recurring; however
 they are deemed to be incremental to income earned or costs incurred by the Company in conducting normal operations
The Shareholders of the Company have elected to treat the Company as a partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. &#160;Accordingly
In May 2015
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an amendment to the fair value measurement guidance that applies to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment using the net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. Under the new guidance
 investments for which fair value is measured
 or are eligible to be measured
 using the NAV per share practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The amendment also removes certain disclosure requirements for these investments.  The adoption of this guidance in 2016 resulted in revisions to the prior year presentation of the fair value hierarchy within Note 10
 Employee Retirement Plans. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial position or results of operations. See Note 10
In August 2016
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The amendment addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. These updates are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied retrospectively unless it is impractical to do so; in which case
In February 2016
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance
 lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
 measured on a discounted basis
 at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally
 this guidance will require disclosures to help financial statement users to better understand the amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases
 including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance should be applied under a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the adoption-period financial statements. Any leases that expire before the initial application date will not require any accounting adjustment. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those annual periods
In July 2015
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify the measurement of inventory. The amendment requires entities to measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value
requirement to measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost or market
 which considers replacement cost
 net realizable value
 and net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2016. The amendment should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption of this guidance
In May 2014
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. Subsequent to the release of this guidance
 the FASB has issued additional updates intended to provide interpretive clarifications and to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue recognition standard both at transition and on an ongoing basis. The new standard and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within that annual reporting period. Upon adoption of the new standard
Other than the items noted above
 there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective or adopted in the current year that are expected to have a significant impact
 or potential significant impact
Once an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;)
 the party with the controlling financial interest
 the primary beneficiary
 is required to consolidate the entity.&#160; The Company has investments in VIEs
 of which the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary based on various characteristics of the arrangements
 including the Company&#8217;s position as the primary recipient of the output of the arrangements.&#160; These are RMMC and RMBC (each as defined below).&#160; Accordingly
Authoritative guidance related to the consolidation of VIEs requires that the Company continually reassess whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of VIEs in which it has an interest. As such
 the conclusion regarding the primary beneficiary status is subject to change
Rocky Mountain Metal Container (&#8220;RMMC&#8221;)
 a Colorado limited liability company
 is a joint venture with Ball Corporation (&#8220;Ball&#8221;) in which the Company holds a 50% interest.  The Company has a can and end supply agreement with RMMC.  Under this agreement
 the Company purchases substantially all of the output of RMMC.  RMMC manufactures cans and ends at the Company's facilities
 which RMMC is operating under a use and license agreement.  As RMMC is a limited liability company (&#8220;LLC&#8221;)
Rocky Mountain Bottle Company (&#8220;RMBC&#8221;)
 a Colorado limited liability company
 is a joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container
 Inc. (&#8220;Owens&#8221;) in which the Company holds a 50% interest.  The Company has a supply agreement with RMBC under which the Company agrees to purchase output approximating the agreed upon annual plant capacity of RMBC.  RMBC manufactures bottles at the Company's facilities
 which RMBC is operating under a lease agreement.  As RMBC is a LLC
The Company has incurred charges it does not believe to be indicative of its core operations or that are significant to operating results warranting separate classification.  As such
Special items
 as reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
During the third quarter of 2015
 MillerCoors announced plans to close its brewery in Eden
 North Carolina
 in an effort to optimize the brewery footprint and streamline operations for greater efficiencies. Products produced in Eden were transitioned to other breweries in the MillerCoors network and the Eden brewery is now closed. Total net special charges for the period of January 1
 2016
 through October 10
 2016 related to the Eden closure were $94.1 million
 including accelerated depreciation on Eden fixed assets of $103.2 million.  Accelerated depreciation represents costs in excess of normal depreciation of Eden assets
 which is classified in cost of goods sold. The restructuring charges of $14.0 million relate primarily to employee related costs
 including severance of $8.5 million. Special items during the period of January 1
 2016
 through October 10
 2016 also include a postretirement medical benefit curtailment gain related to the closure of Eden of $25.7 million.  See Note 11
For the year ended December 31
 2015
 MillerCoors incurred special charges of $67.7 million related to the closure of the Eden brewery
 including $61.3 million of accelerated depreciation in excess of normal depreciation. The restructuring charges of $4.0 million relate to severance. MillerCoors expects to continue to incur special charges during 2017 related to the closure of the brewery. Total special charges associated with the Eden closure are expected to be up to approximately $180 million
 of which $161.8 million have been incurred through the period ended October 10
 2016
 consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation. However
 this estimate is uncertain
 and actual results could differ from these estimates due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate net cost associated with the disposition of assets
 contract termination costs
During the period of January 1
 2016
 through October 10
 2016
 MillerCoors recognized a gain of $8.5 million in special items for the excess of the fair value of its previously held equity interest in a craft brewer over its carrying value as of the acquisition date. See Note 17
During 2015
 the Company recognized a pension settlement loss of $42.4 million. The settlement loss related to an offer to certain terminated vested plan participants for a one-time opportunity to receive the present value of their accrued monthly pension benefit under the plan in the form of a lump sum distribution. Settlement payments made from plan assets under this offer in 2015
 when combined with lump sum payments made during 2015 under the plan's normal terms
 triggered a partial settlement event and increased net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10
During 2014
 the Company continued restructuring activities impacting approximately 200 salaried employees in order to reduce fixed costs.  Related to this restructuring program
 the Company recorded charges for the year ended December 31
 2014 of $1.4 million.  Severance costs included in total restructuring charges for the year ended December 31

 the carrying value of goodwill resulted primarily from the Shareholders' transactions prior to the formation of the joint venture.  The Company is required to perform goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances.  As of October 10
 2016
 the annual November goodwill impairment test had not been performed for the period of January 1
 2016
 through October 10
 2016
 due to the timing of the Acquisition.  However
 there have been no indicators of impairment identified that require the Company to perform an impairment test.  The increase in Goodwill for the period of January 1

The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.  The derivative assets and liabilities are valued using the listed markets if market data for identical contracts exist or a combination of listed markets and published prices if market data for similar contracts exist.  As such
 these derivative instruments are classified within Level 1 or Level 2

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]





Unless otherwise noted in this report
 any description of we
 us or our includes Molson Coors Brewing Company (MCBC or the Company)
 principally a holding company
 and its operating and non-operating subsidiaries included within our reporting segments and Corporate. Our reporting segments include: MillerCoors&#160;LLC (MillerCoors or U.S. segment)
 operating in the United States (U.S.); Molson Coors Canada (MCC or Canada segment)
 operating in Canada; Molson Coors Europe (Europe segment)
 operating in Bulgaria
 Croatia
 Czech Republic
 Hungary
 Montenegro
 Republic of Ireland
 Romania
 Serbia
 the United Kingdom (U.K.) and various other European countries; and Molson Coors International (MCI or MCI segment)
On November 11
 2015
 Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (&#8220;ABI&#8221;) announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SABMiller plc (SABMiller) (&#8220;ABI/SABMiller transaction&#8221;) and concurrently
 on November 11
 2015
 we entered into a purchase agreement (as amended
 the Purchase Agreement) with ABI to acquire
 contingent upon the closing of the ABI/SABMiller transaction
 voting interest in MillerCoors and all trademarks
 in cash
October&#160;11
 2016
 the Acquisition was completed and MillerCoors
 previously a joint venture between MCBC and SABMiller
 became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC. Accordingly
October&#160;11
 2016
 economic ownership interest in MillerCoors was accounted for under the equity method of accounting
 and
 therefore
 its results of operations were reported as equity income in MillerCoors in the consolidated statements of operations
 share of MillerCoors' net assets were reported as investment in MillerCoors in the consolidated balance sheets. Beginning October 11
 2016
 MillerCoors was fully consolidated and continues to be reported as our U.S. segment. Additionally
 our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31
 2016
 includes our acquired assets and liabilities
Note 4
Unless otherwise indicated
 information in this report is presented in U.S. dollars (USD or $) and comparisons are to comparable prior periods. Our primary operating currencies
 other than USD
 include the Canadian Dollar (CAD)
 the British Pound (GBP)
 and our Central European operating currencies such as the Euro (EUR)
 Czech Koruna (CZK)
Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.&#160;GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates
 judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates
 judgments and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable
 based on information available at the time they are made. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results
Our net sales represent the sale of beer and other malt beverages (including adjacencies
 such as cider and hard soda) net of excise taxes
 the vast majority of which are brands that we own and brew ourselves. We import or brew and sell certain non-owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. In addition
 we contract manufacture for other brewers in some of our markets
Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership
 including the risk of loss
 are transferred to the customer or distributor depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms. The cost of various programs
 such as price promotions
 rebates and coupon programs are treated as a reduction of sales. In certain of our markets
 slotting or listing fees are paid to customers and are also treated as a reduction of sales. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms. Sales are stated net of incentives
We do not have standard terms that permit return of product; however
In addition to supplying our own brands
 the U.K. business (within our Europe segment) sells other beverage companies' products to on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. We refer to this as the factored brand business. Sales from this business are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold.  In the factored brand business
 we normally purchase inventory
 which includes excise taxes charged by the vendor
 take orders from customers for such brands
 and invoice customers for the product and related costs of delivery. In accordance with guidance pertaining to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent
Payments made to customers are conditional on the achievement of volume targets
 marketing commitments
 or both. If paid in advance
 years). Where there is no sufficiently separate identifiable benefit
 and the payment is linked to volumes
 or fair value cannot be established
 the amortization of the prepayment or the cost as incurred is included in sales discounts as a reduction to sales and where there are specific marketing activities/commitments
 the cost is included as marketing
In the U.K.
 loans are extended to a portion of the retail outlets that sell our brands. We reclassify a portion of beer revenue to interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these loans. In fiscal years 
 
 these amounts were 
 
 and 
 respectively
Excise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on beer shipments. Excise taxes on beer shipments are shown in a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of sales. Excise taxes are recognized as a liability
Our cost of goods sold includes costs we incur to make and ship beer. These costs include brewing materials
 such as barley
 hops and various grains. Packaging materials
 such as glass bottles
 aluminum cans
 cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Additionally
 our cost of goods sold include both direct and indirect labor
 shipping and handling including freight costs
 utilities
 maintenance costs
 warehousing costs
 purchasing and receiving costs
 depreciation
 promotional packaging
 other manufacturing overheads and costs to purchase factored brands from suppliers
Marketing
Our marketing
 general and administrative expenses include media advertising (television
 radio
 digital
 print)
 tactical advertising (signs
 banners
 point-of-sale materials) and promotion costs on both local and national levels within our operating segments. The creative portion of our advertising activities is expensed as incurred. Production costs of advertising and promotional materials are expensed when the advertising is first run. Marketing
 general and administrative expenses also include acquisition and integration costs of 
 respectively
This classification includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance
 legal
 human resources and information technology
 along with acquisition and integration costs as noted above
 which consist primarily of labor and outside services
 as well as bad debt expense related to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP
 legal costs are expensed when incurred. These costs also include our marketing and sales organizations
 including labor and other overheads. This line item additionally includes amortization costs associated with intangible assets
Share-based compensation is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period of the awards. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. Our share-based compensation plan and the awards within it contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon change in control
 retirement
 disability or death of eligible employees and directors. Our share-based awards are considered vested when the employee's retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing service
 which for certain awards can result in immediate recognition for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or accelerated recognition for awards granted to individuals that will become retirement eligible within the stated vesting period. Also
 if less than the stated vesting period
Our special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that either we do not believe to be indicative of our core operations
 or we believe are significant to our current operating results warranting separate classification; specifically
infrequent or unusual items
impairment or asset abandonment-related losses
restructuring charges and other atypical employee-related costs
The items classified as special items are not necessarily non-recurring
 however
 they are deemed to be incremental to income earned or costs incurred by the company in conducting normal operations
On October 11
 2016
 following the close of the Acquisition
 MillerCoors became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC and as a result
 of the outstanding equity and voting interests of MillerCoors. Prior to October 11
 2016
 MCBC's equity income in MillerCoors represented our proportionate share for the period of the net income of our investment in MillerCoors accounted for under the equity method. This amount reflected adjustments to eliminate intercompany gains and losses
 and to amortize
 if appropriate
Interest Expense
Our interest costs are associated with borrowings to finance our operations. In addition to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents across our business
 interest income in the Europe segment is associated with trade loans receivable from customers
 primarily in the U.K. As noted above
 this includes a portion of beer revenue which is reclassified to interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these loans. Changes in estimates (if any) to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest liabilities
 which are presented within other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet
          Our other income (expense) classification primarily includes gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to brewing and selling beer. For instance
 aggregate unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement and settlement of foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities
 as well as certain gains or losses on sales of non-operating assets are classified in this line item. These gains and losses are reported in the operating segment in which they occur; however
 foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances are reported within the Corporate segment. The initial recording of foreign-denominated transactions are classified based on the nature of the transaction
 with the unrealized or realized foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the subsequent remeasurement of the monetary asset or liability
 and its ultimate settlement
Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets
 liabilities
 and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We apply the intraperiod tax allocation rules to allocate our provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings
 such as discontinued operations and other comprehensive income (loss) when we meet the criteria prescribed by the guidance. We provide for taxes that may be payable if undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries were to be remitted to the U.S.
 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest
Other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) represents income and losses for the reporting period
 including the related tax impacts
 which are excluded from net income (loss) and recognized directly within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) as a component of equity. OCI also includes amounts reclassified to income during the reporting period that were previously recognized within AOCI. Amounts remaining within AOCI are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI in the future
 at which point they will be recognized within the consolidated statement of operations as a component of net income (loss). We recognize OCI related to the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than USD
 unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion of our derivatives designated in cash flow and net investment hedging relationships
 actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
 as well as our proportionate share of our equity method investments' OCI. Additionally
 we do not have the expectation or intent to cash settle certain of our intercompany note receivable and note payable positions in the foreseeable future; therefore
Cash consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with multiple
Supplementary cash flow includes non-cash issuances of share-based awards. We also have non-cash investing activities related to movements in our guarantee of indebtedness of certain equity method investments
 related to the receipt of a note upon the sale of our U.K. malting facility in 2015. In addition
 total Acquisition consideration also includes non-cash investing activity related to the issuance of replacement share-based compensation awards

We record accounts and notes receivable at net realizable value. This carrying value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts and notes receivable balances. We calculate this allowance based on our country-specific history of write-offs
 level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with and the economic status of our customers

 which are kept on hand for repairs and maintenance of machinery and equipment. The majority of spare parts within our business include motors
 fillers and other components that are required to maintain a normal level of production in the event that expected maintenance and/or repairs are required. These parts are inventoried within current assets as they are reasonably expected to be used during the normal operating cycle of the business and are reserved for excess and obsolescence

Properties are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 years. Land is not depreciated
 and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Costs of enhancements or modifications that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated accordingly. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss

Returnable containers are recorded at acquisition cost and consist of returnable bottles
 kegs
 pallets and crates that are both in our direct control within our breweries
 warehouses and distribution facilities and those that we indirectly control in the market through our agreements with our customers and other brewers and for which a deposit is received. The deposits received on our returnable containers in the market are recorded as deposit liabilities
 included as current liabilities within accounts payable and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We estimate that the loss

The costs of acquiring or developing internal-use computer software
 including directly-related payroll costs for internal resources
Properties held under capital lease are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term
 whichever is shorter
Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment
 or a business unit one level below that operating segment
 for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. As of the date of our annual impairment test
 performed as of October 1
 the operations in each of the specific regions within our Canada
 Europe and MCI segments are considered components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. We have concluded that the components within the Canada and Europe segments each meet the criteria as having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the Canada and Europe reporting units
 respectively. Additionally
 we determined that the components within our MCI segment do not meet the criteria for aggregation with the exception of the operations of our India businesses
 which constitute a separate reporting unit. As required
 owned investments where we exercise significant influence or VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We use the cumulative earnings approach for determining cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investees. Distributions received are included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities

We use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest
 foreign currency exchange
 commodity
 production and packaging material costs and for other strategic purposes related to our core business. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only
 including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize our derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value and are classified in either current or non-current assets or liabilities based on each contract's respective unrealized gain or loss position and each contract's respective maturity. Our policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis
 without regard to counterparty master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Further
 our current derivative agreements do not allow us to net positions with the same counterparty and therefore
Changes in fair values (to the extent of hedge effectiveness) of outstanding cash flow and net investment hedges are recorded in OCI
 until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the underlying hedged item or the sale of the underlying net investment
 respectively. Effective cash flow hedges offset the gains or losses recognized on the underlying exposure in the consolidated statements of operations
 or for net investment hedges
We record realized gains and losses from derivative instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Changes in unrealized gains and losses for derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recorded directly in earnings each period and are also recorded in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Cash flows from the settlement of derivatives
 including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships
In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance
 we do not record the fair value of derivatives for which we have elected the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exemption. We account for these contracts on an accrual basis
We maintain retirement plans for the majority of our employees. We offer different types of plans within each segment
 including defined benefit plans
 defined contribution plans and other postretirement benefit plans (OPEB). Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. Our equity investments

 maintain defined benefit
We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur within OCI. The funded status of a plan
 measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation
Projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the measurement date of all benefits attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date using assumptions as to future compensation levels and years of service if the plan benefit formula is based on those future compensation levels and years of service. Accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or unvested) attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensation
 if applicable
We employ the corridor approach for determining each plan's potential amortization from AOCI of deferred gains and losses
 which occur when actual experience differs from estimates
 of the market-related value of plan assets and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants. For plans closed to new entrants and the future accrual of benefits
The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value as recorded due to the short-term nature of these instruments. In addition
 the carrying amounts of our trade loan receivables
 net of allowances
 approximate fair value. The fair value of derivatives is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows utilizing observable market interest

 for additional information. Based on current market rates for similar instruments

In March 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify and improve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The guidance includes amendments that require excess tax benefits or deficiencies resulting from share-based payments be recognized in the income statement as a component of the provision for income taxes
 whereas previously these were recognized within additional paid-in-capital. Further
 the new guidance provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new standard also amends the presentation of employee share-based payment-related items in the statement of cash flows by requiring that: (i) excess tax benefits be classified as cash inflows provided by operating activities (MCBC previously included within cash flows from financing activities)
 and (ii) cash paid to taxing authorities arising from the withholding of shares from employees be classified as cash outflows used in financing activities (MCBC previously included within cash flows from operating activities). We early adopted this guidance during the quarter ended September 30
December&#160;31
 2016
 as a result of excess tax benefits generated during 2016 being recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes as opposed to additional paid-in-capital. The amendments also impacted our calculation of diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method
 as excess tax benefits and deficiencies resulting from share-based payments are no longer included in the assumed proceeds calculation. These provisions of the new guidance have been adopted on a prospective basis as of January 1
 2016
 which is the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. As permitted by this standard
 the Company has elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. The cash flow impacts of the adoption of this guidance were applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. These impacts resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities

Note 20
In August 2016
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The amendment addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. We have early adopted this guidance effective for our year ended December 31
In January 2017
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance
 the recognition of an impairment charge is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value; however
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis
 and is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1
In February 2016
issued authoritative guidance intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance
 lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
 measured on a discounted basis
 at the commencement date for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Additionally
 this guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases
 including qualitative and quantitative requirements. The guidance should be applied under a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the adoption-period financial statements. Any leases that expire before the initial application date will not require any accounting adjustment. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those annual periods
In July 2015
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify the measurement of inventory. The amendment requires entities to measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 and replaces the current requirement to measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost or market
 which considers replacement cost
 net realizable value
 and net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2016. The amendment should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption of this guidance
In May 2014
 the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. The guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements which are intended to help financial statement users better understand the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue being recognized. Subsequent to the release of this guidance
 the FASB has issued additional updates intended to provide interpretive clarifications and to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue recognition standard both at transition and on an ongoing basis. The new standard and related amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within that annual reporting period. Upon adoption of the new standard
 the use of either a full retrospective or cumulative effect transition method is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact this new guidance will have on our financial statements and do not anticipate early adoption. We have not completed this evaluation and therefore
 cannot conclude whether the guidance will have a significant impact on our financial statements at this time. However
 based on preliminary work completed
 we are considering the implications that the new standard may have on our contract brewing arrangements
 presentation of certain customer related trade spend
 as well as the timing of recognition of certain promotional discounts
 which are areas that could potentially be impacted by the adoption of the new guidance. We currently anticipate that we will utilize the cumulative effect transition method
 however
Other than the items noted above
 there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective or adopted in the current year that we believe have a significant impact
 or potential significant impact
 to our consolidated financial statements.

The acquisition of MillerCoors was reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a step acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. As such

Under the acquisition method
 MCBC recorded all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition-date fair values. The excess of total consideration
 including the estimated fair value of our previously held equity interest in MillerCoors
 over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. We have completed the preliminary detailed valuation analyses necessary to assess the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized as of the Acquisition date. The amounts shown below for certain assets and liabilities

BRI is a beer distribution and retail network for the Ontario region of Canada
 with majority of the ownership residing with MCC
 Labatt Breweries of Canada LP (a subsidiary of ABI) and Sleeman Breweries Ltd. (a subsidiary of Sapporo International). BRI charges its owners administrative fees that are designed so the entity operates on a cash neutral basis. This administrative fee is based on costs incurred
 net of other revenues earned
 and is allocated in accordance with the operating agreement to its owners based on volume of products. Contractual provisions cause participation in governance and other interests to fluctuate based on this calculated market share requiring frequent primary beneficiary evaluations. However
 based on the existing structure
 control is shared
 and remains shared through such changes
 and therefore we do not anticipate becoming the primary beneficiary in the foreseeable future. We consider BRI an affiliate. See Affiliate Transactions section below summarizing our transactions and balances with affiliates
In 2015
 we
 along with the other owners of BRI and the Province of Ontario
 agreed to revise the ownership structure of BRI. The new BRI shareholder agreement (&#8220;New Shareholder Agreement&#8221;) incorporating these changes became effective at the beginning of 2016
 at which time BRI converted all existing capital stock into a new share class
 as well as created a separate share class to facilitate new and existing brewer participation and governance. While governance and board of director participation continues to have the ability to fluctuate based on market share relative to the other owners
 our equity interest has become fixed under the New Shareholder Agreement. We have evaluated the changes within the New Shareholder Agreement from a primary beneficiary perspective and concluded that we will continue to account for BRI as an equity method investment
We have an obligation to proportionately fund BRI's operations. As a result of this obligation
 we continue to record our proportional share of BRI's net income or loss and OCI activity

The increase in the effective income tax rate for 2016 versus 2015 was primarily driven by higher pretax income in 2016 resulting from the Acquisition related revaluation gain discussed above
 of MillerCoors' pretax income following the completion of the Acquisition
 each of which were taxed at the U.S. federal and state income tax rates. Additionally
 deferred tax expense was not required to be recorded on the difference between our historical tax basis in goodwill and the new book basis in goodwill resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in MillerCoors. This resulted in a partially offsetting decrease to the effective tax rate
 which is presented in the Acquisition related permanent items line in the table above
 primarily due to lower effective income tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses
. In addition

MillerCoors continues to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes following the completion of the Acquisition. Accordingly
 deferred tax liability recognized on the fair value remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in MillerCoors. This increase was partially offset by the recognition of deferred tax assets in acquisition accounting related to certain temporary differences associated with the acquired 58% interest in MillerCoors. This increase was also partially offset by the acceleration of taxable income in 2016 related to our investment in MillerCoors
 which was previously deferred
Separately
 during 2016
 we recorded additional tax loss carryforwards in certain European jurisdictions in the aggregate of 
 primarily driven by investment losses recognized based on local statutory accounting requirements. As the carryforwards were generated in jurisdictions where we do not have operations
 we concluded that it was more likely than not that the net operating losses would not be realized
 and thus recorded a full valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets. The recognition of these deferred tax assets and fully offsetting valuation allowance resulted in a zero net impact to the consolidated statement of operations
 balance sheet and statement of cash flows. This valuation allowance increase was partially offset by the release of valuation allowances in certain U.S.
 Canada and European jurisdictions
Our deferred tax valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if
 based upon available evidence
 it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income
 including the reversal of existing temporary differences
 historical and projected operating results and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on this analysis

 we received proceeds of approximately

 shares of our Class B common stock. See Class B Common Stock Equity Issuance below for further discussion. During 2015
 we repurchased Class B common shares which results in a lower number of outstanding shares compared to issued shares. See Share Repurchase Program below for further discussion. For all other classes
The Class&#160;A exchangeable shares and Class&#160;B exchangeable shares were issued by Molson Coors Canada&#160;Inc. (MCCI)
 a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The exchangeable shares are substantially the economic equivalent of the corresponding shares of Class&#160;A and Class&#160;B common stock that a Molson shareholder would have received in the Merger if the holder had elected to receive shares of Molson Coors common stock. Holders of exchangeable shares also receive
 through a voting trust
 the benefit of Molson Coors voting rights
Each holder of record of Class A common stock
 Class B common stock
 Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares is entitled to one vote for each share held
 without the ability to cumulate votes on the election of directors. Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over company actions requiring stockholder approval. Specifically
 holders of Class B common stock voting together as a single class have the right to elect three directors of the Molson Coors Board of Directors
 as well as the right to vote on certain additional matters as outlined in the our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended
 the &#8220;Certificate&#8221;)
 such as merger agreements that require approval under applicable law
 sales of all or substantially all of the our assets to unaffiliated third parties
 proposals to dissolve MCBC
 and certain amendments to the Certificate that require approval under applicable law
 each as further described and limited by the Certificate. The Certificate also provides that holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock shall vote together as a single class
 on an advisory basis
The Certificate provides for the right of holders of Class&#160;A common stock to convert their stock into Class&#160;B common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time. The exchangeable shares are exchangeable at any time
On February 3
 2016
 we completed an underwritten public offering of our Class B common stock
 which increased the number of Class B common shares issued and outstanding by 
 net of issuance costs. The proceeds from the issuance were utilized to partially fund the completion of the Acquisition on October 11

 of our Class A and Class B common stock. The number
 price and timing of the repurchases will be at the Company&#8217;s sole discretion and will be evaluated depending on market conditions
 liquidity needs or other factors. The Company&#8217;s board of directors may suspend
 modify or terminate the program at any time without prior notice. This repurchase program replaces and supersedes any repurchase programs previously approved by the board of directors. Under Delaware state law
 these shares are not retired
 and we have the right to resell any of the shares repurchased. Beginning in April 2015
 under this program
 we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (&#8220;ASRs&#8221;) with a financial institution. In exchange for up-front payments
 the financial institution delivered shares of our common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered
 and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share
 was determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume weighted-average price of our common stock during that period. The up-front payments for the treasury stock were accounted for as a reduction to shareholders&#8217; equity in the consolidated balance sheet in the periods the payments are made. We reflected each ASR as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to our own common stock. Each ASR met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification
 and therefore
During the last three quarters of 2015
. As a result of the Acquisition
 we suspended the share repurchase program and thus
 there have been no shares of Class A or Class B common stock repurchased in 2016. There were no share repurchases in 2014.

We completed our required annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing as of October 1

 the first day of our fourth quarter
 and concluded there were no impairments of goodwill within our Europe
 Canada or India reporting units; however
 core brands impairment
 there were no other impairments of our indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the annual review process. However
 as further discussed below
 we identified a triggering event in our India reporting unit in April 2016
 and as a result
As of the date of our annual impairment test
 performed as of October 1
 2016
 the operations in each of the specific regions within our Canada
 Europe and MCI segments are considered components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. We have concluded that the components within the Canada and Europe segments each meet the criteria as having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the Canada and Europe reporting units
 respectively. Additionally
 we determined that the components within our MCI segment do not meet the criteria for aggregation
 and therefore
 annual goodwill impairment testing determined that the fair value of our Canada reporting unit declined from the prior year
 largely due to continued economic and competitive challenges negatively impacting our business
 core brands as further discussed below. Our Europe reporting unit fair value remained comparable with the prior year
 and continues to be considered at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Specifically
 in excess of carrying value
 respectively
 as of the October 1
 2016
 testing date. The excess of the fair value over the carrying value of the Europe reporting unit slightly improved from the prior year. The improvement in the current year was driven by a decrease to the carrying value of the reporting unit versus the prior year
 in addition to the fair value of the reporting unit benefiting from improved cost savings estimates and favorable tax rate changes

 resulting in a reduction of forecasted results in comparison to the prior year

 the fair value is sensitive to further unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows

During the annual impairment testing as of October 1

brand indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value
 portfolio. Specific changes included a continued decline in performance throughout 2016 which drove a downward shift in management's forecasts
 a challenging market dynamic and competitive conditions not expected to subside in the near-term
 as well as an increased discount rate. As a result
 core brand impairment during our annual testing
 core brands had characteristics that indicated a definite-life assignment was more appropriate
 including prolonged weakness in consumer demand driven by increased economic and competitive pressures. These factors have resulted in sustained declines in brand performance
 and it is unclear when these ongoing pressures on the brands will subside. These brands were therefore reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets with the remaining aggregate fair value of approximately 
 which equals the carrying value as of October 1
 2016
Our Europe indefinite-lived intangibles' fair values
brands
 continue to be sufficiently in excess of their respective carrying values as of the annual testing date. During 2015 and 2014
 we also recognized impairment charges on certain European indefinite-lived brands of 
 respectively. These brands were reclassified as definite-lived intangible assets as of September 30

 years. Separately
indefinite-lived brands in the U.S. were recognized at their fair values upon completion of the Acquisition on October 11
We utilized Level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets
As of the date of our annual impairment test
 performed as of October 1
 the Europe reporting unit goodwill is at risk of future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows (including prolonged
 or further weakening of
 adverse economic conditions or significant unfavorable changes in tax
 environmental or other regulations
 including interpretations thereof)
 terminal growth rates
 market multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses. For testing purposes
 management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. Current projections used for our Europe reporting unit testing reflect continued challenging environments in the future followed by growth resulting from a longer term recovery of the macroeconomic environment
 as well as the benefit of anticipated cost savings and specific brand-building and innovation activities. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result
 there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows
 specifically
 a decrease in sales volume and increase in costs that could significantly impact our immediate and long-range results
 a decrease in sales volume driven by a prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends
 a continuation of the trend away from core brands in certain of our markets
 especially in markets where our core brands represent a significant portion of the market
 unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets
 (ii)&#160;adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a recession or worsening of the overall European economy)
 (iii)&#160;volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital
 (iv) sensitivity to market multiples; and (v) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing
Based on known facts and circumstances
 we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items
 as well as related potential implications
While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets in excess of carrying values
 if our assumptions are not realized
Regarding definite-lived intangibles
 we continuously monitor the performance of the underlying asset for potential triggering events suggesting an impairment review should be performed. Excluding the definite-lived intangible asset impairment charge associated with the triggering event which occurred in Bihar
 India further discussed below
. In addition
 no such triggering events were identified in 2015 or 2014
 with the exception of the license agreement litigation settlement with Miller in Canada
In the fourth quarter of 2015
 a newly elected government in the state of Bihar
 India announced plans to ban the sale of country liquor and to limit the sale of other forms of alcohol
 such as beer
 to certain government owned outlets
 effective April 1
 2016. On April 5
 2016
 four days after the start of the ban on country liquor
 the government of the state of Bihar announced immediate changes to the ban
 implementing a complete prohibition of the sale and consumption of all forms of alcohol. Due to this triggering event
 and as the expected length of the prohibition was unclear and was expected to remain in effect for the foreseeable future
 we performed an interim impairment assessment for the impacted tangible assets
 intangible assets and the India reporting unit goodwill. Specifically
 upon identification of the triggering event we completed step one of the goodwill impairment test comparing the fair value of the India reporting unit to its carrying value using a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches
 which resulted in the need to complete step two. Upon completion of step two
 we recorded an impairment of tangible assets of 
 based on foreign exchange rates at December 31
 2016
 is associated with cash flows in other states in India
 where alcohol sales are not prohibited. We continue to monitor legal proceedings impacting the regulatory environment as it relates to our ability to resume operations in the state. In addition
 if the facts or circumstances associated with the expected collectibility of certain Bihar receivables due from the government of approximately 
 based on foreign exchange rates at December 31
 2016
 adversely change or if future cash flows are adversely impacted relative to the projected cash flows used in the impairment analysis
 we may incur additional impairment or other losses in future periods.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
 Net of Tax [Abstract]





Other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) represents income and losses for the reporting period
 including the related tax impacts
 which are excluded from net income (loss) and recognized directly within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) as a component of equity. OCI also includes amounts reclassified to income during the reporting period that were previously recognized within AOCI. Amounts remaining within AOCI are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI in the future
 at which point they will be recognized within the consolidated statement of operations as a component of net income (loss). We recognize OCI related to the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than USD
 unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion of our derivatives designated in cash flow and net investment hedging relationships
 actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
 as well as our proportionate share of our equity method investments' OCI. Additionally
 we do not have the expectation or intent to cash settle certain of our intercompany note receivable and note payable positions in the foreseeable future; therefore

We maintain retirement plans for the majority of our employees. Depending on the benefit program
 we provide either defined benefit pension or defined contribution plans to our employees in each of our segments. Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. We have defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. (MillerCoors)
 U.K.
 Canada and Japan. All retirement plans for MCBC Corporate employees in the U.S. are defined contribution pension plans. Additionally
 we offer OPEB plans to a portion of our Canadian
 U.S. (MillerCoors and Corporate) and Central European employees; these plans are not funded. BRI and BDL maintain defined benefit
 defined contribution and postretirement benefit plans as well; however
 for the post-Acquisition period of October 11
 2016
 through December 31
 2016. Additionally
 MillerCoors' postretirement health plan qualifies for the federal subsidy under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (&#8220;the Act&#8221;) because the prescription drug benefits provided under the Company's postretirement health plan for Medicare eligible retirees generally require lower premiums from covered retirees and have lower co-payments and deductibles than the benefits provided in Medicare Part D and
 accordingly
 are actuarially equivalent to or better than the benefits provided under the Act. The benefits paid

 largely resulted from the inclusion of the MillerCoors pension and OPEB plans and change in the nature of the global economic environment
The obligations of our defined benefit pension plans in the U.S.
 Canada and the U.K. are supported by assets held in trusts for the payment of future benefits. The business segments are obligated to adequately fund these asset trusts. The underlying investments within our defined benefit pension plans include: cash and short-term instruments
 debt securities
 equity securities
 investment funds
 and other investments including derivatives
Each plan's respective allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given a focus on a long-term time horizon for fulfilling the plans' obligations. All assets are managed by external investment managers with a mandate to either match or outperform their benchmark. The plans use different asset managers in the U.S.
Our investment strategies for our defined benefit pension plans also consider the funding status for each plan. For defined benefit pension plans that are highly funded
 assets are invested primarily in fixed income holdings that have a similar duration to the associated liabilities. For plans with lower funding levels
 the fixed income component is managed in a similar manner to the highly funded plans. In addition to this liability-matching fixed income allocation
 these plans also contain exposure to return generating assets including: equities
 real estate
 debt
 and other investments held with the goal of producing higher returns
Both our U.K. and Canadian plans hedge a portion of the foreign exchange exposure between plan assets that are not denominated in the local plan currency and the local currency as the Canadian and U.K. pension liabilities will be settled in CAD and GBP

 we did not have any individual underlying asset position that composed a significant concentration of each plan's overall assets. However
 we currently have significant plan assets invested in U.K.
Further
 as our benefit plans maintain exposure to non-government investments
 a significant system-wide increase in credit spreads would also negatively impact the reported plan asset values. In general
 equity and fixed income risks have been mitigated by company-specific concentration limits and by utilizing multiple equity managers. We do have significant amounts of assets invested with individual fixed income and hedge fund managers
 therefore
We use a variety of industry accepted valuation techniques to value our plan assets. The techniques vary depending upon instrument type. Whenever possible
 we prioritize the use of observable market data in our valuation processes. We use market

Cash and short-term instruments&#8212;Includes cash
 trades awaiting settlement
 bank deposits
 short-term bills and short-term notes. Our trades awaiting settlement category includes payables and receivables associated with asset purchases and sales that are awaiting final cash settlement as of year end due to the use of trade date accounting for our pension plans assets. These payables normally settle within a few business days of the purchase or sale of the respective asset. The respective assets are included in or removed from our year end plan assets and categorized in their respective asset categories in the fair value hierarchy below. We include these items in Level&#160;1 of this hierarchy
 as the values are derived from quoted prices in active markets. Short-term instruments are included in Level&#160;2 of the fair value hierarchy as these are highly liquid instruments that are valued using observable inputs
Debt securities&#8212;Includes various government and corporate fixed income securities
 interest and inflation-linked assets such as bonds and swaps
 collateralized securities
 and other debt securities. The majority of the plans' fixed income assets trade on over the counter exchanges
 which provides observable inputs that are the primary data used to determine each individual investment's fair value. We also use independent pricing vendors
 as well as matrix pricing techniques. Matrix pricing uses observable data from other similar investments as the primary input to determine the individual security's fair value. Government and corporate fixed income securities are generally classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using observable inputs. Assets included in our collateralized securities include mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations
Equities&#8212;Includes publicly traded common and other equity-like holdings
NAV per share practical expedient&#8212;Includes our debt funds

Other&#8212;Includes derivatives
 repurchase agreements
 recoverable taxes for taxes paid and awaiting reclaim due to the tax exempt nature of the pension plan
 venture capital
 and private equity. Derivatives are priced using observable inputs including yields
 interest rate curves and spreads. Exchange traded derivatives are typically priced using the last trade price. Repurchase agreements are agreements where our plan has created an asset exposure using borrowed assets
 creating a repurchase agreement liability
 to facilitate the trade. The assets associated with the repurchase agreement are included in the other category in the fair value hierarchy
 and the repurchase agreement liability is classified as Level&#160;1 in the hierarchy
 as the liability is valued using quoted prices in active markets. When determining the presentation of our target and asset allocations for repurchase agreements
 we are viewing the asset type
 as opposed to the investment vehicle
 and accordingly include the associated assets within fixed income
 specifically interest and inflation linked assets. We include recoverable tax items in Level&#160;1 of this hierarchy

We use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
To achieve our objectives
 we enter into a variety of financial derivatives
 including foreign currency exchange
 commodity
While
 by policy
 the counterparties to any of the financial derivatives we enter into are major institutions with investment grade credit ratings of at least A- by Standard&#160;&amp; Poor's (or the equivalent) or A3 by Moody's
 we are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties. This credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts
We have established a counterparty credit policy and guidelines that are monitored and reported to management according to prescribed guidelines to assist in managing this risk. As an additional measure
 we utilize a portfolio of institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries that we conduct our business. In calculating the fair value of our derivative balances
 we also record an adjustment to recognize the risk of counterparty credit and our own non-performance risk
We base the fair value of our derivative instruments upon market rates and prices. The volatility of these rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. The current fair values of our contracts could differ significantly from the cash settled values with our counterparties. As such
We may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date upon the occurrence of certain contractual triggers including a change of control
 termination event or other breach of agreement. This could have a negative impact on our liquidity. For derivative contracts that we have designated as hedging instruments
 early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the forecasted transaction or firm commitment. We may also decide to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date through negotiations with our counterparties
Due to the nature of our counterparty agreements
 we are not able to net positions with the same counterparty across business units. Thus
 in the event of default
 we may be required to early settle all out-of-the-money contracts
We do not receive and are not required to post collateral unless a change of control event occurs. This termination event would give either party the right to early terminate all outstanding swap transactions in the event that the other party consolidates
 merges with
 or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
 another entity

Our foreign currency forwards are designated in hedging relationships as cash flow hedges. Prior to settlements discussed below
 our forward starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges
 our interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges and our cross currency swaps were designated as net investment hedges. In certain situations
 we may execute derivatives that do not qualify for
 or we do not otherwise seek
 hedge accounting but are determined to be important for managing risk. For example
 our commodity swaps
Note 4
 were not designated in a hedge accounting relationship. These outstanding economic hedges are measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. We have historically elected to apply the NPNS exemption to certain contracts
We formally document all relationships receiving hedge accounting treatment between hedging instruments and hedged items
 as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions pursuant to prescribed guidance. We also formally assess effectiveness both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis
We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1)&#160;the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a forecasted future transaction; (2)&#160;the derivative expires or is sold
 terminated
When we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively
 but it continues to be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period
 the existing gain or loss on the derivative remains in AOCI for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or in the carrying value of the hedged item for fair value hedges and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However
 if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter
 the gains and losses in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding
 we carry the derivative at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheets until maturity

In 2006
 we sold our entire equity interest in Kaiser to FEMSA Cerveza&#160;S.A. de C.V. (FEMSA). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for certain exposures related to tax
 civil and labor contingencies arising prior to FEMSA's purchase of Kaiser. In addition
 we provided an indemnity to FEMSA for losses Kaiser may incur with respect to tax claims associated with certain previously utilized purchased tax credits.

 we believe that any payments

 we believe that any reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements
In addition to the specific cases discussed below
 we are involved in other disputes and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings
 in our opinion
 based on a review with legal counsel
 none of these disputes or legal actions are expected to have a material impact on our business

During the fourth quarter of 2014
 and first quarters of 2015 and 2016
 we received assessments from a local country regulatory authority related to indirect tax calculations in our Europe operations during the 
December&#160;31
.&#160;While we continue to challenge the validity of these assessments and defend our position regarding the method of calculation
 if the assessments
 as issued
 are ultimately upheld
 they could materially affect our results of operations

 we estimate a current range of loss of up to approximately 
December&#160;31
 2016
During the fourth quarter of 2016
 following on-going discussions with the regulatory authority and consideration of existing facts and circumstances
 we have concluded that a portion of this estimated range of loss is deemed probable. As a result
 we recorded a charge of approximately 
 based on foreign exchange rates at December 31
 2016
 within the excise taxes line item on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31
 2016. While this provision was estimated based on the best information available at this time
 significant judgment is required and the ultimate outcome of the assessments is inherently uncertain. Therefore
We continue to follow the required regulatory procedures in order to proceed with our appeal of the assessments and are proactively engaged with the regulatory authority to mutually resolve this matter. The indirect tax calculation methodology challenged in the assessments continues to be applied by us while the regulatory appeal process remains ongoing
 and
 as a result
 the related range of loss is expected to increase until ultimately resolved. Moreover
 if the assessments are upheld in full or in part
 in addition to potentially recording an additional charge
 we would be subject to increased indirect taxes on future sales on an ongoing basis
Separately
 in 2013 we became aware of potential liabilities in several European countries primarily related to local country regulatory matters associated with StarBev Holdings S.a.r.l. (StarBev) pre-acquisition periods. We recorded liabilities related to these matters in the second quarter of 2013 as we finalized purchase price accounting related to the acquisition of StarBev. During the first quarter of 2014
 these matters were favorably resolved and we released the associated indirect-tax and income-tax-related reserves

 Canada. BRI and its owners
 including Molson Coors Canada
 as well as the LCBO are named as defendants in the action. The plaintiffs allege that The Beer Store (retail outlets owned and operated by BRI) and LCBO improperly entered into an agreement to fix prices and market allocation within the Ontario beer market to the detriment of licensees and consumers. The plaintiffs seek to have the claim certified as a class action on behalf of all Ontario beer consumers and licensees and
 among other things

 sale and distribution of beer in the province. Additionally
 prices at The Beer Store are independently set by each brewer and are approved by the LCBO on a weekly basis. As such
When we determine it is probable that a liability for environmental matters or other legal actions exists and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable
 an estimate of the future costs is recorded as a liability in the financial statements. Costs that extend the life

During the fourth quarter of 2016
 we corrected the allocation of income tax expense assigned to the subsidiary guarantors and subsidiary non guarantors to derive equity income (loss) in subsidiaries in 2015 and 2014.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]










Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries
 as well as certain variable interest entities (VIEs) for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 




Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.&#160;GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates
 judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates
 judgments and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable
 based on information available at the time they are made. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results
 our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.




Our net sales represent the sale of beer and other malt beverages (including adjacencies
 such as cider and hard soda) net of excise taxes
 the vast majority of which are brands that we own and brew ourselves. We import or brew and sell certain non-owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. In addition
 we contract manufacture for other brewers in some of our markets
Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership
 including the risk of loss
 are transferred to the customer or distributor depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms. The cost of various programs
 such as price promotions
 rebates and coupon programs are treated as a reduction of sales. In certain of our markets
 slotting or listing fees are paid to customers and are also treated as a reduction of sales. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms. Sales are stated net of incentives
We do not have standard terms that permit return of product; however
In addition to supplying our own brands
 the U.K. business (within our Europe segment) sells other beverage companies' products to on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. We refer to this as the factored brand business. Sales from this business are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold.  In the factored brand business
 we normally purchase inventory
 which includes excise taxes charged by the vendor
 take orders from customers for such brands
 and invoice customers for the product and related costs of delivery. In accordance with guidance pertaining to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent
Payments made to customers are conditional on the achievement of volume targets
 marketing commitments
 or both. If paid in advance
 years). Where there is no sufficiently separate identifiable benefit
 and the payment is linked to volumes
 or fair value cannot be established
 the amortization of the prepayment or the cost as incurred is included in sales discounts as a reduction to sales and where there are specific marketing activities/commitments
 the cost is included as marketing
In the U.K.
 loans are extended to a portion of the retail outlets that sell our brands. We reclassify a portion of beer revenue to interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these loans. In fiscal years 
 
 these amounts were 
 
 and 
 respectively
 included in the Europe segment.




Excise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on beer shipments. Excise taxes on beer shipments are shown in a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of sales. Excise taxes are recognized as a liability
 with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority.




Our cost of goods sold includes costs we incur to make and ship beer. These costs include brewing materials
 such as barley
 hops and various grains. Packaging materials
 such as glass bottles
 aluminum cans
 cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Additionally
 our cost of goods sold include both direct and indirect labor
 shipping and handling including freight costs
 utilities
 maintenance costs
 warehousing costs
 purchasing and receiving costs
 depreciation
 promotional packaging
 other manufacturing overheads and costs to purchase factored brands from suppliers
 as well as the estimated cost to facilitate product returns.



Marketing
 General and Administrative Expenses
Our marketing
 general and administrative expenses include media advertising (television
 radio
 digital
 print)
 tactical advertising (signs
 banners
 point-of-sale materials) and promotion costs on both local and national levels within our operating segments. The creative portion of our advertising activities is expensed as incurred. Production costs of advertising and promotional materials are expensed when the advertising is first run. Marketing
 general and administrative expenses also include acquisition and integration costs of 
 respectively
This classification includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance
 legal
 human resources and information technology
 along with acquisition and integration costs as noted above
 which consist primarily of labor and outside services
 as well as bad debt expense related to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP
 legal costs are expensed when incurred. These costs also include our marketing and sales organizations
 including labor and other overheads. This line item additionally includes amortization costs associated with intangible assets
Share-based compensation is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period of the awards. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. Our share-based compensation plan and the awards within it contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon change in control
 retirement
 disability or death of eligible employees and directors. Our share-based awards are considered vested when the employee's retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing service
 which for certain awards can result in immediate recognition for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or accelerated recognition for awards granted to individuals that will become retirement eligible within the stated vesting period. Also
 if less than the stated vesting period
 we recognize these costs over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved.




Our special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that either we do not believe to be indicative of our core operations
 or we believe are significant to our current operating results warranting separate classification; specifically
infrequent or unusual items
impairment or asset abandonment-related losses
restructuring charges and other atypical employee-related costs
The items classified as special items are not necessarily non-recurring
 however
 they are deemed to be incremental to income earned or costs incurred by the company in conducting normal operations
 and therefore are presented separately from other components of operating income. 




On October 11
 2016
 following the close of the Acquisition
 MillerCoors became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCBC and as a result
 of the outstanding equity and voting interests of MillerCoors. Prior to October 11
 2016
 MCBC's equity income in MillerCoors represented our proportionate share for the period of the net income of our investment in MillerCoors accounted for under the equity method. This amount reflected adjustments to eliminate intercompany gains and losses
 and to amortize
 if appropriate
 any difference between cost and underlying equity in net assets upon the formation of MillerCoors.



Interest Expense
 Policy
Our interest costs are associated with borrowings to finance our operations. In addition to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents across our business
 interest income in the Europe segment is associated with trade loans receivable from customers
 primarily in the U.K. As noted above
 this includes a portion of beer revenue which is reclassified to interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these loans. Changes in estimates (if any) to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest liabilities
 which are presented within other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet
 are also recognized within interest expense. 




Our other income (expense) classification primarily includes gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to brewing and selling beer. For instance
 aggregate unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement and settlement of foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities
 as well as certain gains or losses on sales of non-operating assets are classified in this line item. These gains and losses are reported in the operating segment in which they occur; however
 foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances are reported within the Corporate segment. The initial recording of foreign-denominated transactions are classified based on the nature of the transaction
 with the unrealized or realized foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the subsequent remeasurement of the monetary asset or liability
 and its ultimate settlement

Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets
 liabilities
 and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We apply the intraperiod tax allocation rules to allocate our provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings
 such as discontinued operations and other comprehensive income (loss) when we meet the criteria prescribed by the guidance. We provide for taxes that may be payable if undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries were to be remitted to the U.S.
 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest
 penalties and offsetting positions related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 




Other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) represents income and losses for the reporting period
 including the related tax impacts
 which are excluded from net income (loss) and recognized directly within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) as a component of equity. OCI also includes amounts reclassified to income during the reporting period that were previously recognized within AOCI. Amounts remaining within AOCI are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI in the future
 at which point they will be recognized within the consolidated statement of operations as a component of net income (loss). We recognize OCI related to the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than USD
 unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion of our derivatives designated in cash flow and net investment hedging relationships
 actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
 as well as our proportionate share of our equity method investments' OCI. Additionally
 we do not have the expectation or intent to cash settle certain of our intercompany note receivable and note payable positions in the foreseeable future; therefore

We have significant levels of net assets denominated in currencies other than the USD due to our operations in foreign countries
 and therefore we recognize OCI gains and/or losses when those items are translated to USD. The foreign currency translation losses recognized during 2016 are due to the weakening of the GBP and other currencies of our Europe operations versus the USD partially offset by slight strengthening of the CAD versus the USD. The foreign currency translation losses recognized during 2015 and 2014 are due to the weakening of the CAD

Cash consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with multiple
Supplementary cash flow includes non-cash issuances of share-based awards. We also have non-cash investing activities related to movements in our guarantee of indebtedness of certain equity method investments

We record accounts and notes receivable at net realizable value. This carrying value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts and notes receivable balances. We calculate this allowance based on our country-specific history of write-offs

 which are kept on hand for repairs and maintenance of machinery and equipment. The majority of spare parts within our business include motors
 fillers and other components that are required to maintain a normal level of production in the event that expected maintenance and/or repairs are required. These parts are inventoried within current assets as they are reasonably expected to be used during the normal operating cycle of the business and are reserved for excess and obsolescence

Properties are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 years. Land is not depreciated
 and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Costs of enhancements or modifications that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated accordingly. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss

Returnable containers are recorded at acquisition cost and consist of returnable bottles
 kegs
 pallets and crates that are both in our direct control within our breweries
 warehouses and distribution facilities and those that we indirectly control in the market through our agreements with our customers and other brewers and for which a deposit is received. The deposits received on our returnable containers in the market are recorded as deposit liabilities
 included as current liabilities within accounts payable and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We estimate that the loss

 including directly-related payroll costs for internal resources
Properties held under capital lease are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term
 whichever is shorter
 and the related depreciation is included in depreciation expense. 




Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment
 or a business unit one level below that operating segment
 for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. As of the date of our annual impairment test
 performed as of October 1
 the operations in each of the specific regions within our Canada
 Europe and MCI segments are considered components based on the availability of discrete financial information and the regular review by segment management. We have concluded that the components within the Canada and Europe segments each meet the criteria as having similar economic characteristics and therefore have aggregated these components into the Canada and Europe reporting units
 respectively. Additionally
 we determined that the components within our MCI segment do not meet the criteria for aggregation with the exception of the operations of our India businesses
 which constitute a separate reporting unit. As required
 we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that would indicate that impairment may have taken place. Our annual test is performed as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter. We continuously monitor the performance of our other definite-lived intangible assets and evaluate for impairment when evidence exists that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. Definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets as this approximates the pattern in which the assets economic benefits are consumed. 




 owned investments where we exercise significant influence or VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We use the cumulative earnings approach for determining cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investees. Distributions received are included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities
 unless the cumulative distributions exceed our portion of the cumulative equity in the net earnings of the equity method investment

We use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest
 foreign currency exchange
 commodity
 production and packaging material costs and for other strategic purposes related to our core business. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only
 including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize our derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value and are classified in either current or non-current assets or liabilities based on each contract's respective unrealized gain or loss position and each contract's respective maturity. Our policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis
 without regard to counterparty master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Further
 our current derivative agreements do not allow us to net positions with the same counterparty and therefore
Changes in fair values (to the extent of hedge effectiveness) of outstanding cash flow and net investment hedges are recorded in OCI
 until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the underlying hedged item or the sale of the underlying net investment
 respectively. Effective cash flow hedges offset the gains or losses recognized on the underlying exposure in the consolidated statements of operations
 or for net investment hedges
We record realized gains and losses from derivative instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Changes in unrealized gains and losses for derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recorded directly in earnings each period and are also recorded in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Cash flows from the settlement of derivatives
 including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships
In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance
 we do not record the fair value of derivatives for which we have elected the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exemption. We account for these contracts on an accrual basis
 recording realized settlements related to these contracts in the same financial statement line items as the corresponding transaction.




We maintain retirement plans for the majority of our employees. We offer different types of plans within each segment
 including defined benefit plans
 defined contribution plans and other postretirement benefit plans (OPEB). Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. Our equity investments
 BRI and BDL
 maintain defined benefit
We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur within OCI. The funded status of a plan
 measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation
Projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the measurement date of all benefits attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date using assumptions as to future compensation levels and years of service if the plan benefit formula is based on those future compensation levels and years of service. Accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or unvested) attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensation
 if applicable
We employ the corridor approach for determining each plan's potential amortization from AOCI of deferred gains and losses
 which occur when actual experience differs from estimates
 of the market-related value of plan assets and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants. For plans closed to new entrants and the future accrual of benefits
 the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants (including retirees) is used. 




The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value as recorded due to the short-term nature of these instruments. In addition
 the carrying amounts of our trade loan receivables
 net of allowances
 approximate fair value. The fair value of derivatives is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows utilizing observable market interest

 for additional information. Based on current market rates for similar instruments

U.S. GAAP guidance for fair value includes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach
Level&#160;2&#8212;Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less active

&#160;interest rates
 yield curves
 etc.)
 and inputs that are derived principally from
 or corroborated by
Level&#160;3&#8212;Unobservable inputs that reflect the assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. We develop these inputs based on the best information available

Disclosure of accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents
 including the policy for determining which items are treated as cash equivalents. Other information that may be disclosed includes (1) the nature of any restrictions on the entity's use of its cash and cash equivalents
 (2) whether the entity's cash and cash equivalents are insured or expose the entity to credit risk
 (3) the classification of any negative balance accounts (overdrafts)
 and (4) the carrying basis of cash equivalents (for example
 at cost) and whether the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

 core brand intangible asset to the Canadian ordinary income tax rate upon reclassification from indefinite-lived to definite-lived subject to amortization (see Note 11
 &#8220;Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221;). This incremental deferred tax expense more than offset the deferred tax benefit associated with the pretax impairment charge. These increases were also slightly offset by the release of certain valuation allowances in 2016.

State income taxes
Other
The increase in the effective income tax rate for 2016 versus 2015 was primarily driven by higher pretax income in 2016 resulting from the Acquisition related revaluation gain discussed above
 of MillerCoors' pretax income following the completion of the Acquisition
 each of which were taxed at the U.S. federal and state income tax rates. Additionally
 deferred tax expense was not required to be recorded on the difference between our historical tax basis in goodwill and the new book basis in goodwill resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in MillerCoors. This resulted in a partially offsetting decrease to the effective tax rate
 which is presented in the Acquisition related permanent items line in the table above
 primarily due to lower effective income tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses
. In addition
 during 2015 and 2014
 our effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax benefits in various taxing jurisdictions as further discussed below.

MillerCoors continues to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes following the completion of the Acquisition. Accordingly
 deferred tax liability recognized on the fair value remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in MillerCoors. This increase was partially offset by the recognition of deferred tax assets in acquisition accounting related to certain temporary differences associated with the acquired 58% interest in MillerCoors. This increase was also partially offset by the acceleration of taxable income in 2016 related to our investment in MillerCoors
 which was previously deferred
Separately
 during 2016
 we recorded additional tax loss carryforwards in certain European jurisdictions in the aggregate of 
 primarily driven by investment losses recognized based on local statutory accounting requirements. As the carryforwards were generated in jurisdictions where we do not have operations
 we concluded that it was more likely than not that the net operating losses would not be realized
 and thus recorded a full valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets. The recognition of these deferred tax assets and fully offsetting valuation allowance resulted in a zero net impact to the consolidated statement of operations
 balance sheet and statement of cash flows. This valuation allowance increase was partially offset by the release of valuation allowances in certain U.S.
 Canada and European jurisdictions
Our deferred tax valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if
 based upon available evidence
 it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income
 including the reversal of existing temporary differences
 historical and projected operating results and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on this analysis

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

The actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the period
 which is calculated as net of expected employee contributions.






















































































Increase (Decrease) in Defined Benefit Plan
 Accumulated Benefit Obligation




























For defined benefit pension plans
 the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or nonvested) attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered before a specified date and based on employee service and compensation (if applicable) before that date. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that it includes no assumption about future compensation levels. For plans with flat-benefit or nonpay-related pension benefit formulas
 the accumulated benefit obligation and the projected benefit obligation are the same.




























The pretax total of net gain (loss)
 prior service cost (credit)
 and transition assets (obligations)
 as well as minimum pension liability if still remaining
 included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan(s) because they have yet to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
























































The pretax net amount of gains and losses that are not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost
 and that are recognized as increases or decreases in other comprehensive income as they arise. Gains and losses are due to changes in the value of either the benefit obligation or the plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from a change in an actuarial assumption
 or the consequence of a decision to temporarily deviate from the substantive plan.




























Amount related to the pretax cost of benefit changes attributable to plan participants' prior service pursuant to a plan amendment or a plan initiation
 which has not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.




























The difference between fair value of plan assets at the end of the period and the fair value at the beginning of the period
 adjusted for contributions and payments of benefits during the period
 and after adjusting for taxes and other expenses
 as applicable.




























Amount of gain (loss) related to change in benefit obligation resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions
 for example
 but not limited to
 interest
 mortality
 employee turnover
 salary
 and temporary deviation from the substantive plan.




























The aggregate net amount recognized in the balance sheet associated with the defined benefit plan(s). Will normally be the same as the Defined Benefit Plan
 Funded Status of Plan
 Total.





















































































1) For defined benefit pension plans
 the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation
 which is the actuarial present value as of a date of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to that date.  2) For other postretirement defined benefit plans
 the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
 which is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee service rendered to a particular date.




























The amount of payments made for which participants are entitled under a pension plan
 including pension benefits
 death benefits
 and benefits due on termination of employment. Also includes payments made under a postretirement benefit plan
 including prescription drug benefits
 health care benefits
 life insurance benefits
 and legal
 educational and advisory services. This item represents a periodic decrease to the plan obligations and a decrease to plan assets.







































































































































































































































Fair value of assets that have been segregated and restricted to provide pension or postretirement benefits. Assets include
 but are not limited to
 stocks
 bonds
 other investments
 earnings from investments
 and contributions by the employer and employees.






















































































The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. Will normally be the same as the net Defined Benefit Plan
 Amounts Recognized in Balance Sheet
 Total.
























































The amount of increase or decrease due to a change in the terms of an existing plan or the initiation of a new plan. A plan amendment may increase or decrease benefits
 including those attributed to years of service already rendered.
