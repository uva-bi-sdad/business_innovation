 which typically have an average size of approximately 100 square feet.&nbsp;We anticipate that the cost of establishing its first retail location - standalone or mall-based store- will be approximately $250

 we currently have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal.

 we set aside one hour out of the day
 Monday through Friday
 for customer&#146;s appointment to provide consultation for the cake that customers would like to order for their event. During the consultation
 we discuss the details about the event and recommend to our customers the type of cake or other baked goods that we believe would be a good fit for that event. Instead of the traditional approach of picking from a book of other cakes
 we brainstorm with our customers and come up with new and creative custom ideas to figure out an individualized cake just for the customers and their event.

Our goal is to maintain the quality of our product and to obtain the resources sufficient to open our first retail location in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. &nbsp;We anticipate that the cost of establishing additional retail locations will be approximately $250

 we will cease our development and/or marketing operations until we raise money. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult. As such
 if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment. &nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to raise additional capital through private placements
 but there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve any capital-raising. If we need additional cash but are unable to raise it
 we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph
 we have no other financing plans.&nbsp;







 we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis.








 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. &nbsp;The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. &nbsp;The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:








        

        

        


        

        

        


        

        


 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.

 as the requisite conditions of competitive

 if made
 shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.




 new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the our company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed
 we believe that recently issued accounting pronouncements adopted do not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.


 the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#148; (&#147;ASU 2014-09&#148;).


 creating a new Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customer. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.





 an entity should apply the following steps:













 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue recognition and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. &nbsp;Qualitative and quantitative information is required about the following:



 disaggregation of revenue
 and information about contract balances and performance obligations (including the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations)


 and determining the transaction price and amounts allocated to performance obligations

 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period for all public entities. &nbsp;Early application is not permitted.


 the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements&#151;Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (&#147;ASU 2014-15&#148;).


 an entity&#146;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management&#146;s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The term probable is used consistently with its use in Topic 450
 Contingencies.


 management should consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. The mitigating effect of management&#146;s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented and
 if so
 (2) it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.


 but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#146;s plans
 the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand all of the following (or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the footnotes):









 and substantial doubt is not alleviated after consideration of management&#146;s plans
 an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that there is substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). Additionally
 the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand all of the following:













 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.


 the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14 &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date&#148; (&#147;ASU 2015-14&#148;).


 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.

 when adopted

517 and $22
916 for the fiscal year ended July 31

202 for the fiscal year ended July 31
 2015. The Company had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $425 for the fiscal year ended July 31
 2015. &nbsp;


 particularly if we are unable to continue generating positive cash flow as a result of our operations. &nbsp;We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions
 that our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations
 without further financing
 for up to 12 months. In addition
 our company may
 from time to time
&nbsp;receive continued funding and capital resources from related parties. However
 as of the date of this 




 such related parties do not have any existing obligation to advance funds or working capital to support our business
 nor can our company rely on any advance funds from such related parties. Other than working capital
 we presently have no other alternative source of working capital. We may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations. We may need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses
 pay our obligations
 and grow our company. We do not anticipate we will be profitable in 2016. &nbsp;Therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. &nbsp;Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities
 obtaining credit facilities
 or other financing mechanisms. However
 a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required
 it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses
 fail to collect amounts owed to us
 or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore
 if we issue additional equity or debt securities
 stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights
 preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our Common Stock. The inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing
 we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations.&nbsp;


 we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore
 our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.


 costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements
 including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. &nbsp;




 which contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.


 we had an accumulated deficit at July 31
 2015
 a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt from our auditor about our ability to continue as a going concern.


 our cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. &nbsp;While we believe in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds
 there can be no assurances to that effect. &nbsp;The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in our ability to raise additional funds.

 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. &nbsp;An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. &nbsp;An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. &nbsp;We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of July 31
 2015 and 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the reporting periods then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


 the Company had an accumulated deficit at July 31

Management&#146;s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 3. &nbsp;The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Sweets &amp; Treats
 Inc. (&#147;CA Corp&#148;)


 Inc. (&#147;Predecessor&#148;) was incorporated on April 13

 cupcakes
 desserts and special events catering.

Sweets &amp; Treats
 Inc. (&#147;DE Corp&#148;)


 Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated on July 7
 2014 under the laws of the State of Delaware for the sole purpose of acquiring all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Predecessor. Upon formation
 the Company issued 10
000
000 shares of its common stock to the President of the Company as founder&#146;s shares valued at par value of $0.00001 and recorded as compensation of $100. 


 2014
 the Company issued 5
000
000 shares of the newly formed corporation&#146;s common stock to the President of the Predecessor for all of the Predecessor&#146;s issued and outstanding capital stock. &nbsp;No value was given to the common stock issued by the newly formed corporation. Therefore
 the shares were recorded to reflect the $0.00001 par value and paid in capital was recorded as a negative amount of ($50). The acquisition process utilizes the capital structure of the Company and the assets and liabilities of Predecessor
 which are recorded at historical cost.


 by reclassifying the Predecessor&#146;s undistributed retained earnings of $942 at July 17
 2014 to additional paid-in capital.





The Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application. &nbsp;Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company&#146;s financial condition and results and require management&#146;s most difficult
 subjective
 or complex judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company&#146;s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.





















: Management&#146;s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical sales
 historical loss levels
 and an analysis of the collectability of individual accounts; and general economic conditions that may affect a client&#146;s ability to pay. The Company evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the allowance in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business

Management assumes that the realization of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carry&#150;forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly
 the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses
 (b) general economic conditions
 and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering
 among other factors.


 and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.


 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.


 changes in facts and circumstances
 historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations
 if deemed appropriate
 those estimates are adjusted accordingly.





of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) to determine whether and how to consolidate another entity. &nbsp;Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned subsidiaries&#151;all entities in which a parent has a controlling financial interest&#151;shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest with the parent
 the majority owner; (2) if the parent is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely to be temporary; (3) consolidation by an investment company within the scope of Topic 946 of a non-investment-company investee. &nbsp;Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8 the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest
 and
 therefore
 as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. &nbsp;The power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership
 for example
 by contract
 lease
 agreement with other stockholders
 or by court decree. The Company consolidates all less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries
 if any
 in which the parent&#146;s power to control exists.

 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. &nbsp;The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. &nbsp;The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.


 such as cash
 accounts receivable
 prepaid professional fees
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 customer deposits and sales tax payable approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.


 as the requisite conditions of competitive
 free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties
 if made
 shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.

 to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c.&nbsp;trusts for the benefit of employees
 such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e.&nbsp;management of the Company; f.&nbsp;other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g.&nbsp;other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.


 other than compensation arrangements
 expense allowances
 and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However
 disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: &nbsp;a.&nbsp;the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. &nbsp;a description of the transactions
 including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed
 for each of the periods for which income statements are presented
 and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c.&nbsp;the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d.&nbsp;amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and

 the terms and manner of settlement.




 which may result in a loss to the Company 





 and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. &nbsp;In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings
 the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.


 then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. &nbsp;If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible
 or is probable but cannot be estimated
 then the nature of the contingent liability
 and an estimate of the range of possible losses
 if determinable and material
 would be disclosed.

 nonemployee directors acting in their role as members of a board of directors are treated as employees if those directors were elected by the employer&#146;s shareholders or appointed to a board position that will be filled by shareholder election when the existing term expires. However
 that requirement applies only to awards granted to nonemployee directors for their services as directors. Awards granted to nonemployee directors for other services shall be accounted for as awards to non-employees.


 i.e.
 the cost of services received from employees in exchange for awards of share-based compensation generally shall be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued or the fair value of the liabilities incurred/settled.


 to exercise share options). That estimate is based on the share price and other pertinent factors
 such as expected volatility
 at the grant date. As such
 the fair value of an equity share option or similar instrument shall be estimated using a valuation technique such as an option pricing model. For this purpose
 a similar instrument is one whose fair value differs from its intrinsic value
 that is
 an instrument that has time value.


 however
 if the Company&#146;s common shares are thinly traded the use of share prices established in its most recent private placement memorandum (&#147;PPM&#148;)
 or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.


 an entity shall estimate the fair value of that instrument using a valuation technique or model that meets the requirements in paragraph 718-10-55-11 and takes into account
 at a minimum
 all of the following factors:












        

        
        


        


 taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees&#146; expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding. &nbsp;Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1
 it may be appropriate to use the 

 expected term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2)
 if (i) A company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time its equity shares have been publicly traded; (ii) A company significantly changes the terms of its share option grants or the types of employees that receive share option grants such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term; or (iii) A company has or expects to have significant structural changes in its business such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options and similar instruments as the company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.
        


        

        
        


        


 an entity would likely consider characteristics such as industry
 stage of life cycle
 size
 and financial leverage. Because of the effects of diversification that are present in an industry sector index
 the volatility of an index should not be substituted for the average of volatilities of otherwise similar entities in a fair value measurement. &nbsp;Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1 if shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market. &nbsp;The Company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected term of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility.
        


        

        
        


        


 the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model.



 such as the inability either to exercise a non-vested equity share option or to sell non-vested shares
 is not reflected in estimating the fair value of the related instruments at the grant date. Instead
 those restrictions are taken into account by recognizing compensation cost only for awards for which employees render the requisite service and a non-vested equity share or non-vested equity share unit awarded to an employee shall be measured at its fair value as if it were vested and issued on the grant date.


 with a corresponding credit to equity (generally
 paid-in capital). The requisite service period is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award
 which often is the vesting period. &nbsp;The total amount of compensation cost recognized at the end of the requisite service period for an award of share-based compensation shall be based on the number of instruments for which the requisite service has been rendered (that is
 for which the requisite service period has been completed). An entity shall base initial accruals of compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. That estimate shall be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments is likely to differ from previous estimates. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be or has been rendered shall be recognized in compensation cost in the period of the change. Previously recognized compensation cost shall not be reversed if an employee share option (or share unit) for which the requisite service has been rendered expires unexercised (or unconverted).










 until July 17
 2014 during which time the Company was treated as a pass through entity for federal income tax purposes. &nbsp;Under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code stockholder of an S corporation are taxed separately on their distributive share of the S corporation&#146;s income whether or not that income is actually distributed.


 2014
 the Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. &nbsp;Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. &nbsp;Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. &nbsp;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.


 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. &nbsp;The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. &nbsp;Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition

 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.


 as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.


 the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management&#146;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.

 the Company carried out an evaluation
 with the participation of the Company's management
 including the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the Company's principal executive officer and interim principal accounting officer)
 of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation
 the Company's Chief Executive Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management
 including Chief Executive Officer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




 in general
 provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements
 but because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


 2015. The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled &#147; Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework&#148; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment
 Based on that evaluation
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
 as of July 31
 2015. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that amounted to material weaknesses.


 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives of having segregation of the initiation of transactions
 the recording of transactions and the custody of assets; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. &nbsp;The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of July 31
 2015.


 management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present
 in all material respects
 our financial position
 results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.




 we plan to initiate
 the following series of measures:


 we plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives of having separate individuals perform (i) the initiation of transactions
 (ii) the recording of transactions and (iii) the custody of assets.&nbsp;Second
 we will create a senior position to focus on financial reporting and standardizing and documenting our accounting procedures with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of the internal controls in preventing and detecting misstatements of accounting information. Third
 we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.





 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
 will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. We did not implement the said remedial measures in fiscal year ended July 31
 2015. We anticipate that these remedial measures will be implemented when our financial conditions permit.

 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements&#13;and related disclosures




 such as cash
 accounts receivable
 prepaid professional fees
 accounts&#13;payable
 accrued expenses

 as the requisite conditions of competitive
 free-market dealings&#13;may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties
 if made

    

 with respect to any specified Person
 any other&#13;Person that
 directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries
 controls
 is controlled by or is under common control with&#13;such Person
 as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act); b.&amp;#160;entities for which investments&#13;in their equity securities would be required
 absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection&#13;of Section 825&amp;#150;10&amp;#150;15
 to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c.&amp;#160;trusts for the benefit&#13;of employees

 other than compensation arrangements
 expense allowances
 and other similar&#13;items in the ordinary course of business. However
 disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated&#13;or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a.&amp;#160;the nature of the&#13;relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions
 including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were&#13;ascribed
 for each of the periods for which income statements are presented
 and such other information deemed necessary to an&#13;understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c.&amp;#160;the dollar amounts of transactions for each&#13;of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms&#13;from that used in the preceding period; and d.&amp;#160;amounts due from or to &lt;font style=color: windowtext&gt;related parties&lt;/font&gt;&#13;as of the date of each balance sheet presented and
 if not otherwise apparent


 which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when&#13;one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment inherently&#13;involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company&#13;or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings

 then the estimated&#13;liability would be accrued in the Company&amp;#146;s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential&#13;material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible
 or is probable but cannot be estimated
 then the nature of&#13;the contingent liability
 and an estimate of the range of possible losses
 if determinable and material



 (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer
 (iii)&#13;the sales price is fixed or determinable


 until July 17

 2014

 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more&#13;likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits&#13;of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the&#13;largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25&#13;also provides guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes


 the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in&#13;these jurisdictions. In management&amp;#146;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual&#13;taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates


 classifies cash receipts&#13;and payments according to whether they stem from operating
 investing
 or financing activities and provides definitions of each&#13;category
 and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (&amp;#147;Indirect method&amp;#148;) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25&#13;of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile&#13;it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and&#13;payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income&#13;that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency&#13;cash flows


 the term is&#13;used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards&#13;Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available&#13;to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the&#13;period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred&#13;stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned)&#13;from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation&#13;of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional&#13;common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect&#13;the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement

 stock purchase contracts
 and partially paid&#13;stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260&amp;#150;10&amp;#150;55&amp;#150;23). Anti-dilutive contracts
 such as purchased put options and&#13;purchased call options
 shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a.&amp;#160;Exercise of options and warrants&#13;shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance



 the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they&#13;are widely distributed to users

    
    
    


 Inc. (&amp;#147;Predecessor&amp;#148;)&#13;was incorporated on April 13

 Inc. (the &amp;#147;Company&amp;#148;)&#13;was incorporated on July 7
 2014 under the laws of the State of Delaware for the sole purpose of acquiring all of the issued and&#13;outstanding capital stock of the Predecessor. Upon formation

000 shares of the newly formed corporation&amp;#146;s common stock to the President of the Predecessor for all of the Predecessor&amp;#146;s&#13;issued and outstanding capital stock. No value was given to the common stock issued by the newly formed corporation.&amp;#160;Therefore
&#13;the shares were recorded to reflect the $0.00001 par value and paid in capital was recorded as a negative amount of ($50). The&#13;acquisition process utilizes the capital structure of the Company and the assets and liabilities of Predecessor

 the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management&#13;made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses
 (b) general economic conditions
 and (c) its ability&#13;to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering

&#13;historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations
 if deemed appropriate

 the majority owner; (2) if the parent is a broker-dealer within the scope&#13;of Topic 940 and control is likely to be temporary; (3) consolidation by an investment company within the scope of Topic 946 of&#13;a non-investment-company investee. &lt;/font&gt;Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8 &lt;font style=color: #252525&gt;the usual condition&#13;for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest
 and
 therefore
 as a general rule ownership by&#13;one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition&#13;pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership
 for example
 by contract
&#13;lease
 agreement with other stockholders
 or by court decree&lt;/font&gt;. The Company consolidates &lt;font style=color: #252525&gt;all&#13;less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries

 nonemployee directors acting in their role as members of a board of directors are treated as employees if those directors&#13;were elected by the employer&amp;#146;s shareholders or appointed to a board position that will be filled by shareholder election&#13;when the existing term expires.

 to exercise share options). That&#13;estimate is based on the share price and other pertinent factors
 such as expected volatility
 at the grant date. As such
 the&#13;fair value of an equity share option or similar instrument shall be estimated using a valuation technique such as an option pricing&#13;model. For this purpose
 a similar instrument is one whose fair value differs from its intrinsic value
 that is

 however
 if the Company&amp;#146;s common shares are thinly traded the use of share prices&#13;established in its most recent private placement memorandum (&amp;#147;PPM&amp;#148;)

 at a minimum

 taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees&amp;#146; expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1
 it may be appropriate to use the &lt;i&gt;simplified method&lt;/i&gt;

 expected term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2)&lt;/i&gt;

 an entity would likely consider characteristics such as industry
 stage of life cycle
 size
 and financial leverage. Because of the effects of diversification that are present in an industry sector index


&#13;such as the inability either to exercise a non-vested equity share option or to sell non-vested shares
 is not reflected in estimating&#13;the fair value of the related instruments at the grant date. Instead

 paid-in capital). The requisite service period&#13;is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award

 based on the technical merits of the position.&#13;The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that&#13;has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance&#13;on de-recognition

 the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management&amp;#146;s&#13;opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies&#13;from estimates

 the term is used to refer to either earnings&#13;or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC&#13;Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the&#13;numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to&#13;common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not&#13;paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing&#13;operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar&#13;to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that&#13;would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential&#13;dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement

 and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260&amp;#150;10&amp;#150;55&amp;#150;23).&#13;Anti-dilutive contracts

 an entity&amp;#146;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions&#13;or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern&#13;within one year after the date that the &lt;i&gt;financial statements are issued &lt;/i&gt;(or within one year after the date that the &lt;i&gt;financial&#13;statements are available to be issued &lt;/i&gt;when applicable). Management&amp;#146;s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions&#13;and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the &lt;i&gt;financial statements are issued &lt;/i&gt;(or at the date that&#13;the &lt;i&gt;financial statements are available to be issued &lt;/i&gt;when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#146;s ability&#13;to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that it is probable&#13;that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements&#13;are issued (or available to be issued). The term &lt;i&gt;probable &lt;/i&gt;is used consistently with its use in Topic 450

 management should consider&#13;whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. The mitigating&#13;effect of management&amp;#146;s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively&#13;implemented and
 if so

 but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration&#13;of management&amp;#146;s plans

 and substantial doubt is not alleviated after consideration&#13;of management&amp;#146;s plans
 an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that there is &lt;i&gt;substantial doubt&#13;about the entity&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern &lt;/i&gt;within one year after the date that the financial statements&#13;are issued (or available to be issued).

&#13;an entity shall estimate the fair value of that instrument using a valuation technique or model that meets the requirements in&#13;paragraph 718-10-55-11 and takes into account
 at a minimum

 taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees&amp;#146; expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1

 expected term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2)&lt;/i&gt;

 an entity would likely consider characteristics such as industry

 size
 and financial leverage. Because of the effects of diversification that are present in an industry sector index


&#13;such as the inability either to exercise a non-vested equity share option or to sell non-vested shares
 is not reflected in estimating&#13;the fair value of the related instruments at the grant date. Instead

 paid-in capital). The requisite service period&#13;is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award

 an entity&amp;#146;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions&#13;or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern&#13;within one year after the date that the &lt;i&gt;financial statements are issued &lt;/i&gt;(or within one year after the date that the &lt;i&gt;financial&#13;statements are available to be issued &lt;/i&gt;when applicable). Management&amp;#146;s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions&#13;and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the &lt;i&gt;financial statements are issued &lt;/i&gt;(or at the date that&#13;the &lt;i&gt;financial statements are available to be issued &lt;/i&gt;when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#146;s ability&#13;to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that it is probable&#13;that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements&#13;are issued (or available to be issued). The term &lt;i&gt;probable &lt;/i&gt;is used consistently with its use in Topic 450

 management should consider&#13;whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. The mitigating&#13;effect of management&amp;#146;s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively&#13;implemented and
 if so

 but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration&#13;of management&amp;#146;s plans

 and substantial doubt is not alleviated after consideration&#13;of management&amp;#146;s plans
 an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that there is &lt;i&gt;substantial doubt&#13;about the entity&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern &lt;/i&gt;within one year after the date that the financial statements&#13;are issued (or available to be issued).

 Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;)
was incorporated on July 7
 2014 under the laws of the State of Delaware for the sole purpose of acquiring all of the issued and

 the Company issued 10
000
000 shares of its common stock to the President
of the Company as founder&#146;s shares valued at par value of $0.00001 and recorded as compensation of $100.

 the Company issued
5
000

Note 2 - Significant and Critical
Accounting Policies and Practices

The
Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of
accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to
the portrayal of the Company&#146;s financial condition and results and require management&#146;s most difficult
 subjective
or complex judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company&#146;s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.




as its fiscal year ending date.




statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).

Use of Estimates and Assumptions
and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions


in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate
on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company&#146;s critical accounting estimates and assumptions
affecting the financial statements were:


: Management&#146;s estimate of the allowance for doubtful
accounts is based on historical sales
 historical loss levels
 and an analysis of the collectability of individual accounts; and
general economic conditions that may affect a client&#146;s ability to pay. The Company evaluated the key factors and assumptions
used to develop the allowance in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

Management assumes
that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business

Management
assumes that the realization of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;)
carry&#150;forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely
than not and accordingly
 the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management
made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses
 (b) general economic conditions
 and (c) its ability
to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering
 among other factors.


or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions
and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.


experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole
under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.


factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information
 changes in facts and circumstances

 if deemed appropriate
 those estimates are adjusted accordingly.

of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to measure the fair value of its financial
instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
(U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair
value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date
the consolidated financial statements are issued
 which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when
one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment inherently
involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company
or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings
 the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings
or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer
 (iii)
the sales price is fixed or determinable
 and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.

Stock-Based Compensation for Obtaining
Employee Services


payment transactions issued to employees under the guidance of the Topic 718 Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC Topic 718&#148;).


employee is an individual over whom the grantor of a share-based compensation award exercises or has the right to exercise sufficient
control to establish an employer-employee relationship based on common law as illustrated in case law and currently under U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) Revenue Ruling 87-41. A nonemployee director does not satisfy this definition of employee.
Nevertheless
 nonemployee directors acting in their role as members of a board of directors are treated as employees if those directors
were elected by the employer&#146;s shareholders or appointed to a board position that will be filled by shareholder election
when the existing term expires. However
 that requirement applies only to awards granted to nonemployee directors for their services
as directors. Awards granted to nonemployee directors for other services shall be accounted for as awards to non-employees.


and 718-10-30-3 a share-based payment transaction with employees shall be measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments
issued and an entity shall account for the compensation cost from share-based payment transactions with employees in accordance
with the fair value-based method
 i.e.
 the cost of services received from employees in exchange for awards of share-based compensation
generally shall be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued or the fair value of the liabilities
incurred/settled.


and 718-10-30-9 the measurement objective for equity instruments awarded to employees is to estimate the fair value at the grant
date of the equity instruments that the entity is obligated to issue when employees have rendered the requisite service and satisfied
any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments (for example
 to exercise share options). That
estimate is based on the share price and other pertinent factors
 such as expected volatility
 at the grant date. As such
 the
fair value of an equity share option or similar instrument shall be estimated using a valuation technique such as an option pricing
model. For this purpose
 a similar instrument is one whose fair value differs from its intrinsic value
 that is
 an instrument
that has time value.


are traded in one of the national exchanges the grant-date share price of the Company&#146;s common stock will be used to measure
the fair value of the common shares issued
 however
 if the Company&#146;s common shares are thinly traded the use of share prices
established in its most recent private placement memorandum (&#147;PPM&#148;)
 or weekly or monthly price observations would
generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger
spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.


if an observable market price is not available for a share option or similar instrument with the same or similar terms and conditions
an entity shall estimate the fair value of that instrument using a valuation technique or model that meets the requirements in
paragraph 718-10-55-11 and takes into account
 at a minimum
 all of the following factors:



    
    




    

 taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees&#146; expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1
 it may be appropriate to use the 

 expected term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2)
 if (i) A company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time its equity shares have been publicly traded; (ii) A company significantly changes the terms of its share option grants or the types of employees that receive share option grants such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term; or (iii) A company has or expects to have significant structural changes in its business such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options and similar instruments as the company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.




    
    




    

 an entity would likely consider characteristics such as industry
 stage of life cycle
 size
 and financial leverage. Because of the effects of diversification that are present in an industry sector index
 the volatility of an index should not be substituted for the average of volatilities of otherwise similar entities in a fair value measurement.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1 if shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.&#160;&#160;The Company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected term of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility.




    
    




    

 the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model.



and 718-10-30-17 a restriction that stems from the forfeitability of instruments to which employees have not yet earned the right
such as the inability either to exercise a non-vested equity share option or to sell non-vested shares
 is not reflected in estimating
the fair value of the related instruments at the grant date. Instead
 those restrictions are taken into account by recognizing
compensation cost only for awards for which employees render the requisite service and a non-vested equity share or non-vested
equity share unit awarded to an employee shall be measured at its fair value as if it were vested and issued on the grant date.


and 718-10-35-3 the compensation cost for an award of share-based employee compensation classified as equity shall be recognized
over the requisite service period
 with a corresponding credit to equity (generally
 paid-in capital). The requisite service period
is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award
 which often is the vesting period.
The total amount of compensation cost recognized at the end of the requisite service period for an award of share-based compensation
shall be based on the number of instruments for which the requisite service has been rendered (that is
 for which the requisite
service period has been completed). An entity shall base initial accruals of compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments
for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. That estimate shall be revised if subsequent information indicates
that the actual number of instruments is likely to differ from previous estimates. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods
of a change in the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be or has been rendered shall
be recognized in compensation cost in the period of the change. Previously recognized compensation cost shall not be reversed if
an employee share option (or share unit) for which the requisite service has been rendered expires unexercised (or unconverted).


718-10-35-8 the Company made a policy decision to recognize compensation cost for an award with only service conditions that has
a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Deferred Tax Assets and Income
Tax Provision


until July 17
 2014 during which time the Company was treated as a pass through entity for federal income tax purposes. Under Subchapter
S of the Internal Revenue Code stockholder of an S corporation are taxed separately on their distributive share of the S corporation&#146;s
income whether or not that income is actually distributed.


 2014
 the Company
accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will
not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.


of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Section 740-10-25&#148;). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination
of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under
Section 740-10-25
 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not
that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance
on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim periods and requires increased
disclosures.


temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets
recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.


interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability.
In addition
 the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management&#146;s
opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies
from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.




is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience
 the term is used to refer to either earnings
or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC
Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the
numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to
common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not
paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing
operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar
to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential
dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement
 stock options or warrants.


through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint
of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting
entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35
through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include
non-vested stock granted to employees
 stock purchase contracts
 and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260&#150;10&#150;55&#150;23).
Anti-dilutive contracts
 such as purchased put options and purchased call options
 shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the
treasury stock method: a.&#160;Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of
issuance
 if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b.&#160;The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be
used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through
55-5.) c.&#160;The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed
purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.

Standards Codification
 the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed
to users
 such as through filing them on EDGAR.




 the FASB issued the FASB
Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 &#147;

This
guidance amends the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification
 creating a new Topic 606

The
core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services

in exchange for those goods or services.

To achieve
that core principle
 an entity should apply the following steps:


Identify the contract(s) with the
customer
Identify the performance obligations
in the contract

Allocate the transaction price to
the performance obligations in the contract
Recognize revenue when (or as) the
entity satisfies a performance obligations


The ASU
also provides guidance on disclosures that should be provided to enable financial statement users to understand the nature
 amount
timing
 and uncertainty of revenue recognition and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.&#160; Qualitative and quantitative
information is required about the following:


&#160;&#150;
including revenue and impairments recognized
 disaggregation of revenue
 and information about contract balances and performance
obligations (including the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations)
Significant judgments and changes
in judgments
and determining the transaction price and amounts allocated to performance obligations
Assets recognized from the costs
to obtain or fulfill a contract.

 which contemplates continuity of operations
 realization
of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.


financial statements

 its cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds
 there can be no
assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company&#146;s ability
to further implement its business plan
 generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds.

of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




































Disclosure of accounting policy for reporting when there is a substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time (generally a year from the balance sheet date). Disclose: (a) pertinent conditions and events giving rise to the assessment of substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time
 (b) the possible effects of such conditions and events
 (c) management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions and events and any mitigating factors
 (d) possible discontinuance of operations
 (e) management's plans (including relevant prospective financial information)
 and (f) information about the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities. If management's plans alleviate the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern
 disclosure of the principal conditions and events that initially raised the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern would be expected to be considered. Disclose whether operations for the current or prior years generated sufficient cash to cover current obligations
 whether waivers were obtained from creditors relating to the company's default under the provisions of debt agreements and possible effects of such conditions and events
 such as: whether there is a possible need to obtain additional financing (debt or equity) or to liquidate certain holdings to offset future cash flow deficiencies. Disclose appropriate parent company information when parent is dependent upon remittances from subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations.

statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).





Use of Estimates and Assumptions
and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions


in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate
on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company&#146;s critical accounting estimates and assumptions
affecting the financial statements were:


: Management&#146;s estimate of the allowance for doubtful
accounts is based on historical sales
 historical loss levels
 and an analysis of the collectability of individual accounts; and
general economic conditions that may affect a client&#146;s ability to pay. The Company evaluated the key factors and assumptions
used to develop the allowance in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

Management assumes
that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business

Management
assumes that the realization of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;)
carry&#150;forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely
than not and accordingly
 the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management
made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses
 (b) general economic conditions
 and (c) its ability
to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering
 among other factors.


or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions
and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.


experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole
under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.


factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information

 if deemed appropriate
 those estimates are adjusted accordingly.

of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to measure the fair value of its financial
instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
(U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair
value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

 which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when
one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment inherently
involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company

 (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer
 (iii)
the sales price is fixed or determinable
 and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.





Stock-Based Compensation for Obtaining
Employee Services


payment transactions issued to employees under the guidance of the Topic 718 Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC Topic 718&#148;).


employee is an individual over whom the grantor of a share-based compensation award exercises or has the right to exercise sufficient
control to establish an employer-employee relationship based on common law as illustrated in case law and currently under U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) Revenue Ruling 87-41. A nonemployee director does not satisfy this definition of employee.
Nevertheless
 nonemployee directors acting in their role as members of a board of directors are treated as employees if those directors
were elected by the employer&#146;s shareholders or appointed to a board position that will be filled by shareholder election
when the existing term expires. However
 that requirement applies only to awards granted to nonemployee directors for their services
as directors. Awards granted to nonemployee directors for other services shall be accounted for as awards to non-employees.


and 718-10-30-3 a share-based payment transaction with employees shall be measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments
issued and an entity shall account for the compensation cost from share-based payment transactions with employees in accordance
with the fair value-based method
 i.e.
 the cost of services received from employees in exchange for awards of share-based compensation
generally shall be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued or the fair value of the liabilities
incurred/settled.


and 718-10-30-9 the measurement objective for equity instruments awarded to employees is to estimate the fair value at the grant
date of the equity instruments that the entity is obligated to issue when employees have rendered the requisite service and satisfied
any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments (for example
 to exercise share options). That
estimate is based on the share price and other pertinent factors
 such as expected volatility
 at the grant date. As such
 the
fair value of an equity share option or similar instrument shall be estimated using a valuation technique such as an option pricing
model. For this purpose
 a similar instrument is one whose fair value differs from its intrinsic value
 that is
 an instrument
that has time value.


are traded in one of the national exchanges the grant-date share price of the Company&#146;s common stock will be used to measure
the fair value of the common shares issued
 however
 if the Company&#146;s common shares are thinly traded the use of share prices
established in its most recent private placement memorandum (&#147;PPM&#148;)
 or weekly or monthly price observations would
generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger
spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.


if an observable market price is not available for a share option or similar instrument with the same or similar terms and conditions
an entity shall estimate the fair value of that instrument using a valuation technique or model that meets the requirements in
paragraph 718-10-55-11 and takes into account
 at a minimum
 all of the following factors:



    
    




    

 taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees&#146; expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1
 it may be appropriate to use the 

 expected term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2)
 if (i) A company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time its equity shares have been publicly traded; (ii) A company significantly changes the terms of its share option grants or the types of employees that receive share option grants such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term; or (iii) A company has or expects to have significant structural changes in its business such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options and similar instruments as the company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.




    
    




    

 an entity would likely consider characteristics such as industry
 stage of life cycle
 size
 and financial leverage. Because of the effects of diversification that are present in an industry sector index
 the volatility of an index should not be substituted for the average of volatilities of otherwise similar entities in a fair value measurement.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1 if shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.&#160;&#160;The Company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected term of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility.




    
    




    

 the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model.



and 718-10-30-17 a restriction that stems from the forfeitability of instruments to which employees have not yet earned the right
such as the inability either to exercise a non-vested equity share option or to sell non-vested shares
 is not reflected in estimating
the fair value of the related instruments at the grant date. Instead
 those restrictions are taken into account by recognizing
compensation cost only for awards for which employees render the requisite service and a non-vested equity share or non-vested
equity share unit awarded to an employee shall be measured at its fair value as if it were vested and issued on the grant date.


and 718-10-35-3 the compensation cost for an award of share-based employee compensation classified as equity shall be recognized
over the requisite service period
 with a corresponding credit to equity (generally
 paid-in capital). The requisite service period
is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award
 which often is the vesting period.
The total amount of compensation cost recognized at the end of the requisite service period for an award of share-based compensation
shall be based on the number of instruments for which the requisite service has been rendered (that is
 for which the requisite
service period has been completed). An entity shall base initial accruals of compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments
for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. That estimate shall be revised if subsequent information indicates
that the actual number of instruments is likely to differ from previous estimates. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods
of a change in the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be or has been rendered shall
be recognized in compensation cost in the period of the change. Previously recognized compensation cost shall not be reversed if
an employee share option (or share unit) for which the requisite service has been rendered expires unexercised (or unconverted).


718-10-35-8 the Company made a policy decision to recognize compensation cost for an award with only service conditions that has
a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.





Deferred
Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision

The Company
was a Subchapter S corporation
 until July 17
 2014 during which time the Company was treated as a pass through entity for federal
income tax purposes. Under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code stockholder of an S corporation are taxed separately on their
distributive share of the S corporation&#146;s income whether or not that income is actually distributed.

Effective
July 18
 2014
 the Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected
to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than
not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date.

The Company
adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Section 740-10-25&#148;). Section 740-10-25 addresses
the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
statements. Under Section 740-10-25
 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits
of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25
also provides guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim periods
and requires increased disclosures.

The estimated
future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets
 as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred
tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.

Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous
estimates of tax liability. In addition
 the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in
these jurisdictions. In management&#146;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual
taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.




Earnings
per Share

Earnings
per share (&#34;EPS&#34;) is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience
 the term is
used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the
period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred
stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned)
from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation
of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect
the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement
 stock options
or warrants.

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate
or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and
their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method
unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied.
Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees
 stock purchase contracts
 and partially paid
stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260&#150;10&#150;55&#150;23). Anti-dilutive contracts
 such as purchased put options and
purchased call options
 shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a.&#160;Exercise of options and warrants
shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance
 if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued.
b.&#160;The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the
period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c.&#160;The incremental shares (the difference between the
number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted
EPS computation.

There
were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the reporting period ended July 31
 2015 or 2014.





Cash
Flows Reporting

The Company
adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting
 classifies cash receipts
and payments according to whether they stem from operating
 investing
 or financing activities and provides definitions of each
category
 and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (&#147;Indirect method&#148;) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile
it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and
payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income
that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency
cash flows
 using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held
in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents
and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the
period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.





Subsequent
Events

The Company
follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events.
The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the&#160;financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
 the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they
are widely distributed to users
 such as through filing them on EDGAR.








 the FASB issued the FASB
Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 &#147;

This
guidance amends the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification
 creating a new Topic 606

The
core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services

in exchange for those goods or services.

To achieve
that core principle
 an entity should apply the following steps:


Identify the contract(s) with the
customer
Identify the performance obligations
in the contract

Allocate the transaction price to
the performance obligations in the contract
Recognize revenue when (or as) the
entity satisfies a performance obligations


The ASU
also provides guidance on disclosures that should be provided to enable financial statement users to understand the nature
 amount
timing
 and uncertainty of revenue recognition and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.&#160; Qualitative and quantitative
information is required about the following:


&#160;&#150;
including revenue and impairments recognized
 disaggregation of revenue
 and information about contract balances and performance
obligations (including the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations)
Significant judgments and changes
in judgments
and determining the transaction price and amounts allocated to performance obligations
Assets recognized from the costs
to obtain or fulfill a contract.


ASU 2014-09
is effective for periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period for
all public entities. &#160;Early application


 the FASB issued the

Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (&#147;ASU 2014-15&#148;).


statements for each annual and interim reporting period
 an entity&#146;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions
or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern
financial
statements are available to be issued 
(or at the date that
when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability
to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that it is probable
that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements
is used consistently with its use in Topic 450
 Contingencies.


or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern
 management should consider
whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. The mitigating
effect of management&#146;s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively
implemented and
 if so
 (2) it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about
the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.


doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern
 but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration
of management&#146;s plans
 the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand
all of the following (or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the footnotes):


Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to
continue as a going concern (before consideration of management&#146;s plans)

Management&#146;s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to
the entity&#146;s ability to meet its obligations

Management&#146;s plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to
continue as a going concern.


doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern
 and substantial doubt is not alleviated after consideration
of management&#146;s plans

about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern 
are issued (or available to be issued). Additionally
 the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial
statements to understand all of the following:


Principal conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to
continue as a going concern

Management&#146;s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to
the entity&#146;s ability to meet its obligations

Management&#146;s plans that are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial
doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.

the effective date of Update 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and
certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December
