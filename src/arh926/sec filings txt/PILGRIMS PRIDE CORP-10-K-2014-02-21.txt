Business


Pilgrim&#146;s
Pride Corporation (referred to herein as &#147;Pilgrim&#146;s
&#148; &#147;PPC
&#148; &#147;the Company
&#148;
&#147;we
&#148; &#147;us
&#148; &#147;our
&#148; or similar terms)
 which was incorporated in Texas in 1968
and reincorporated in Delaware in 1986
 is the successor to a partnership
founded in 1946 as a retail feed store. We are one of the largest chicken
producers in the world with operations in the United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;)
 Mexico and
Puerto Rico. We are primarily engaged in the production
 processing
 marketing
and distribution of fresh
 frozen and value-added chicken products to retailers
distributors and foodservice operators. We offer a wide range of products to our
customers through strong national and international distribution channels. We
employ approximately 36
700 people and have the capacity to process more than
34.7 million birds per week for a total of more than 10.2 billion pounds of live
chicken annually. In 2013
 we generated $8.4 billion in total revenue and
produced 7.2 billion pounds of chicken products. 
The Company operates on the basis of
a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday falling on or before December
31. The reader should assume any reference we make to a particular year (for
example
 2013) in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements applies to
our fiscal year and not the calendar year. Fiscal 2013 was a 52-week fiscal
year. 
We market our balanced portfolio of
fresh
 prepared and value-added chicken products to a diverse set of customers
across the U.S.
 Mexico and in approximately 100 other countries. We have become
a valuable partner to our customers and a recognized industry leader by
consistently providing high-quality products and services designed to meet their
needs and enhance their business. Our sales efforts are largely targeted towards
the foodservice industry
 principally chain restaurants and food processors such
as Chick-fil-A
 distributors
and retail customers
 including grocery
store chains and wholesale clubs such as Kroger
Wal-Mart
 Costco
 and Sam&#146;s
Club
Our Mexico operations generated
approximately 10.8% of our net sales in 2013. We are one of the largest
producers and sellers of chicken in Mexico and we believe we are one of the most
efficient producers of chicken in that region. Our presence in Mexico provides
access to a market with growing demand and has enabled us to leverage our
operational strengths within the region. The market for chicken products in
Mexico is still developing with most sales attributed to fresh
commodity-oriented
 market price-based business. We believe our Mexico business
is well positioned to continue benefiting from these trends in the Mexican
consumer market. Additionally
 we are an important player in the live market
which accounts for approximately 33% of the industry&#146;s chicken sales in Mexico
in 2013. We intend to expand our presence in Mexico by capitalizing on our vast
experience in providing a broad range of high-quality products in addition to
our well-known service. 
As a vertically integrated company
we control every phase of the production of our products. We believe that
vertical integration helps us better manage food safety and quality
 as well as
more effectively control margins and improve customer service. We currently
operate in 12 U.S. states
 Puerto Rico and Mexico. Our plants are strategically
located to ensure that customers timely receive the freshest products. We
operate 24 fresh processing plants in the U.S.
 six prepared foods cook plants
in the U.S.
 one fresh processing plant in Puerto Rico
 three processing plants
in Mexico
 and 13 distribution centers (one in Puerto Rico and 12 in Mexico). In
addition
 the Company operates eight rendering facilities (five in the U.S.
 one
in Puerto Rico and two in Mexico) and three pet food plants in the U.S. The
Company has six additional processing plants that are currently idle. Combined
with our global network of approximately 4
200 growers
 28 feed mills and 36
hatcheries
 we believe we are well positioned to supply the growing demand for
our products.
On December 1
 2008
Pilgrim's and six of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas
 Fort Worth Division
(the &#147;Bankruptcy Court&#148;)
 seeking reorganization relief under the provisions of
Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code. We emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings on December 28
 2009. See &#147;Note 1. Business and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies&#148; of our Consolidated Financial Statements
included in this annual report for additional information.


The U.S. consumes more chicken than
any other protein (approximately 31.1 billion pounds projected in calendar year
2014 according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#147;USDA&#148;))
 and chicken is
the second most consumed protein globally after pork. The U.S. is the world&#146;s
largest producer of chicken and is projected to produce approximately 38.5
billion pounds of ready-to-cook broiler meat in calendar year 2014
 representing
20.0% of the total world production. China and Brazil produce the second and
third most broiler meat
 with 16.9% and 15.6% of the world market
 respectively
according to the USDA. 



The U.S.
is the second-largest exporter of broiler meat behind Brazil. The U.S. is
projected to export 7.5 billion pounds in calendar year 2014
 which would
account for 31.0% of the total world exports and 19.6% of the total U.S.
production
 according to the USDA. The top five exporters controlled over 87% of
the market in 2013.
The broiler export marketplace has
grown at a rapid pace since the early 1990s. The growth has been driven by
various geopolitical events such as the collapse of the former Soviet Union and
consumption growth in emerging markets
 as well as changing consumer
preferences. Key importers of broilers include Russia
 China
 the EU
 Mexico and
Saudi Arabia. Other export markets such as Hong Kong
 Vietnam
 the Middle East
and Africa are projected to increase their imports of U.S. chicken. 
The U.S. market is concentrated with
four major chicken producers accounting for over 50% of production. The U.S.
chicken industry is largely vertically integrated with major producers owning
and operating feed mills
 processing plants and further processing plants while
contracting out breeding and broiler production to thousands of contractually
bound chicken farmers. More than 90% of all chickens raised for consumption are
produced by farmers under contracts with processing companies. Processing
companies provide the growers with chickens
 feed
 vaccines and medicines
required for the production of broilers. The grower supplies all systems and
labor required to bring the broilers up to slaughter weight. The grower is then
paid based on the weight gain exhibited by the flock. 
According to the USDA
 chicken
production in the U.S. increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 1.4% from
2002 through 2012. Similarly
 per capita consumption of chicken in the U.S.
increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 0.8% during this same period of
time. Also during this same period of time
 per capita beef consumption in the
U.S. declined at a compounded annual growth rate of 0.8% while per capita pork
consumption in the U.S. increased at a compounded annual growth rate of only
0.1%. The growth in chicken demand is attributable to (i) relative
affordability compared to other proteins such as beef and pork
 (ii) the
increasingly health conscious nature of U.S. consumers
 (iii) chicken&#146;s
consistent quality and versatility and (iv) its introduction on many foodservice
menus. In addition
 global protein demand has remained strong
 and we believe
protein demand will continue to expand consistent with rising standards of
living and a growing middle class in developing countries around the world. USDA
estimates from 2010 through 2020 show an anticipated increase of global chicken
demand of 29%
 81% of which is expected to come from emerging markets. We
believe our relationship with our largest stockholder
 JBS USA Holdings
 Inc.
(&#147;JBS USA&#148;) positions us to capture a portion of those emerging markets.

We benefit from a shorter production
lifecycle of broilers compared to other proteins. While production for cattle
takes approximately 28 to 39 months from breeding to slaughter and the
production for pork takes 11 to 12 months
 the production lifecycle for the
broiler is only ten weeks. There are three key components of broilers that are
sold for consumption: the breast
 the wing and the leg quarters. An estimated
88% of broiler production in the U.S. is sold in separate parts
 rather than as
a whole bird. This is due primarily to domestic preferences associated with
white meat
 as well as increased demand for boneless breasts and wings.

Key Industry Dynamics

 Changes to either the supply or demand components of the
chicken market can significantly impact the profitability of key players in the
industry
 including our company. Specifically
 any supply or demand shift within
the broiler industry can drive a change in pricing of chicken products and
significantly affect the income generated by the producer. Items that influence
chicken pricing in the U.S. include international demand
 changes in production
by other broiler producing countries
 input costs and the demand associated with
substitute products such as beef and pork. While broiler producers attempt to
match supply and demand
 a minor change in downstream demand can impact whether
the planned supply meets the market need. We believe our focus on sales mix
enables us to adapt to changing supply demand dynamics by adjusting our
production to maximize value.

 Broilers are fed corn and soybean meal as well as certain
vitamins and minerals. Corn and soybean meal accounted for approximately 50% and
27% of our feed costs
 respectively
 in 2013. Broiler production is
significantly more efficient from a feed perspective than cattle or hog
production. Approximately two pounds of feed are required for each pound of
chicken
 as compared to approximately seven and 3.5 pounds for cattle and hogs
respectively.
Historically
 cost of feed had been
largely steady
 with occasional spikes resulting from externalities. These
externalities often took the form of poor weather conditions
 such as droughts
or excessive rains leading to poor crop yields and increased demand both
domestically for ethanol and globally for protein production. In recent years
feed prices have also been impacted by increased demand both domestically for
ethanol and globally for protein production. Market prices for feed ingredients
remained at historically high levels until the latter half of 2013 and remain
volatile. In response to these volatile market prices
 we have sought to
mitigate the impact of feed price volatility on our profitability by decreasing
the amount of our products that are sold under longer term fixed price
contracts
 broadening our product portfolio and expanding the variety of
contracts within our book of business. We believe that having a broad product
portfolio provides flexibility in our product offerings
and enables us to focus our production on the most profitable products within
any feed ingredient price environment. Additionally
 we believe that having a
variety of contracts with more flexible pricing reduces the risk associated with
volatile feed prices by creating a spread model
 which allows us to reflect
market prices on a more real-time basis
 while ensuring volume commitments to
our customer base. 



Competitive Strengths

We
believe that our competitive strengths will enable us to maintain and grow our
position as a leading chicken company and to capitalize on future favorable
growth opportunities: 
Leading market position
 We
are a leading chicken producer in the U.S. with a 19.0% market share
 based on
ready-to-cook production in 2013. We are also one of the largest chicken
producers on a global basis. We believe we can maintain this prominent market
position as we are one of the few producers in the chicken industry that can
fully satisfy the requirements of large retailers and foodservice companies due
to our broad product range
 national distribution and technical capabilities. We
believe we are well positioned to be the primary chicken supplier for large
customers due to our ability to provide consistent supply
 innovate and develop
new products to address consumer desires and provide competitive pricing across
a diverse product portfolio. Our vertical integration gives us control over our
supply of chicken and chicken parts. Further
 our processing facilities offer a
wide range of capabilities and are particularly suited for the high-volume
production as well as low-volume custom production runs necessary to meet both
the capacity and quality requirements of our customer base. Finally
 we have
established a reputation for dependable quality
 highly responsive service and
excellent technical support while tailoring our products to market taste
preferences.
Experienced management
 We have a proven senior management team whose tenure in the
chicken industry has spanned numerous market cycles and is among the most
experienced in the industry. Our senior management team is led by William W.
Lovette
 our Chief Executive Officer
 who has over 30 years of experience in the
chicken industry. Our management team has successfully improved and realigned
our business and instilled a corporate culture focused on performance and
accountability. Management's strategy included the implementation of zero-based
budgeting and plant-level profit and loss analysis
 driving engagement and
ownership over the results at each plant. Our senior operating executives have
backgrounds with leading agribusiness companies
 including Tyson Foods
 Inc.
ConAgra Foods
 Inc. and Bunge Limited. We believe that this combination of
backgrounds and experience will continue to provide the foundation for a
results-oriented business strategy and will enable us to maintain and strengthen
long-term relationships with customers and help us grow our business in the
future. We also benefit from management ideas
 best practices
 and talent shared
with the seasoned management team at our majority stockholder
 JBS USA
 and its
parent company
 JBS S.A.
 who have over 50 years of combined experience
operating protein processing facilities in South America
 North America and
Australia.
Leaner
 As a  result of our
restructuring efforts
 we are a more efficient and lean  organization supported by a market-driven business strategy. Since
2008
 we have  closed
 idled or sold 11 plants and 14 distribution centers
 reduced or  consolidated production at other
facilities
 streamlined our workforce and  reduced administrative and corporate expenses including moving our corporate
headquarters and closing satellite headquarters as part of our becoming a  majority owned subsidiary of JBS USA. In addition
we continue to make  significant production improvements driven by improved yields
 labor
 cost  savings and product mix.
Since 2010
 these efforts have resulted in a $642.0 million cumulative annualized run rate improvement in plant-related
costs
 sales mix  and product yield. As a result of these efforts
 we are a financially stronger  company with a more
conservative capital structure since we emerged from  bankruptcy in 2009.
Blue chip and diverse
 We benefit from strong relationships with leading companies in every
customer segment
 including Chick-fil-A
 Sysco
 US
Foods
 Yum! Brands
 Kroger
 Wal-Mart
Costco
 Publix
and ConAgra
Foods
 all of whom have been doing business with us for more than
five years. We sell our products to a large and diverse customer base
 with over
5
000 customers and no concentrations above 7.0% of net sales except for our
largest customer
 Wal-Mart Stores
 Inc.
 which accounted for 9.7% of net sales
in 2013. 
Relationship with JBS
 As a majority-owned subsidiary
of JBS USA
 we work closely with JBS USA&#146;s management to identify areas where
both companies can achieve synergies. As part of our integration plan
 we moved
our headquarters to Greeley
 Colorado
 the headquarters of JBS USA. In addition
to cost savings through the integration of certain corporate functions and the
rationalization of facilities
 our relationship with JBS USA allows us to enjoy
several advantages given its diversified international operations and strong
record in commodity risk management. We seek to leverage JBS USA&#146;s international
network by expanding into untapped international markets and strengthening our
presence in geographies in which we already operate. In addition
 JBS USA&#146;s
expertise in managing the risk associated with volatile commodity inputs will
help us to further improve our operations and manage our
margins.




We intend
to continue growing our business and enhancing profitability by pursuing the
following strategies: 
Valued partner with our
 We are a leading
producer of chicken products in the world. We have developed and acquired
complementary markets
 distributor relationships and geographic locations
establishing relationships with broad-line national distributors and retailers
that have enabled us to expand our customer base and provide nationwide
distribution capabilities for all of our product lines. As a result
 we believe
we are one of only two U.S. chicken producers that can supply the growing demand
for a broad range of price competitive standard and specialized products with
well-known brand names on a nationwide basis from a single-source supplier.
Additionally
 we intend to leverage our innovation capabilities to develop new
products along with our customers to accelerate sales and enhance the
profitability of chicken products at their businesses. By having best-in-class
quality management systems
 we plan to further enhance our industry position by
optimizing our sales mix and production to increase our profitability and
accelerate innovation.
Operational
 As production and sales grow
 we continue to focus on
improving operating efficiencies by focusing on cost reductions
 more effective
processes
 training and our total quality management program. Specific
initiatives include:
Benchmarking live and plant costs against the

Striving to be in the top 25% of the industry for

Fostering a culture of accountability and

Conducting monthly performance reviews with senior

  
Strategically grow value
 We will continue our
focus on expanding international sales by seeking opportunities to increase
penetration in our existing markets and entering attractive new markets.
Expansion of our export sales complements our U.S. chicken operations and
positions us to capitalize on expected global demand growth
 particularly in
emerging markets. According to the USDA
 the export of U.S. chicken products
increased at an average annual growth rate of 4.4% from 2002 through 2012. We
believe U.S. chicken exports will continue to grow as global demand increases
for high-quality
 low-cost meat protein sources. Utilizing the extensive sales
network of JBS USA
 we believe that we can accelerate the sales of value-added
chicken products into our international distribution channels. Our key
international markets include Mexico
 the Middle East
 Asia and countries within
the Commonwealth of Independent States (&#147;CIS&#148;). Our relationship with JBS USA
has improved our access to markets such as Africa
 the Middle East
 Latin
America and Asia. We believe substantial opportunities exist to expand our sales
to these markets by capitalizing on direct international distribution channels
supplemented by our existing export broker relationships. We also believe that
opportunities exist to sell more profitable products into these markets and
continue to look for opportunities to invest capital to support these markets.
Our export sales accounted for approximately 10.0% of our U.S. chicken sales in
2013. 
Reportable Business Segment

We operate in one reportable
business segment
 as a producer and seller of chicken products we either produce
or purchase for resale in the U.S.
 Puerto Rico and Mexico. We conduct separate
operations in the U.S.
 Puerto Rico and Mexico; however
 for geographic
reporting purposes
 we include Puerto Rico with our U.S. operations. See &#147;Note
19. Business Segment and Geographic Reporting&#148; of our Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this annual report for additional information.

Narrative Description of Business


Our primary product types are fresh
chicken products
 prepared chicken products and value-added export chicken
products. We sell our fresh chicken products to the foodservice and retail
markets. Our fresh chicken products consist of refrigerated (nonfrozen) whole or
cut-up chicken
 either pre-marinated or non-marinated and prepackaged case-ready
chicken. Our case-ready chicken includes various combinations of freshly
refrigerated
 whole chickens and chicken parts in trays
 bags or other consumer
packs labeled and priced ready for the retail grocer&#146;s fresh meat counter. Our
fresh chicken sales accounted for 59.9% of our total U.S. chicken sales in 2013.

We also sell prepared chicken
products
 including portion-controlled breast fillets
 tenderloins and strips
delicatessen products
 salads
 formed nuggets and patties and bone-in chicken
parts. These products are sold either refrigerated or frozen and may be fully
cooked
 partially cooked or raw. In addition
 these products are breaded or
non-breaded and either pre-marinated or non-marinated. Our prepared chicken
products sales accounted for 29.7% of our total U.S. chicken sales in 2013.

Value-added export and other chicken
products primarily consist of whole chickens and chicken parts sold either
refrigerated for distributors in the U.S. or frozen for distribution to export
markets. We sell U.S.-produced chicken products for export to Mexico
 the Middle East
 Asia
 countries within the CIS and
other world markets. In the U.S.
 prices of these products are negotiated daily
or weekly and are generally related to market prices quoted by the USDA or other
public price reporting services. Prices for export sales are determined by
supply and demand and local market conditions. In certain newly accessed
international markets
 we have established premium brands
 which allow us to
market our products at a premium to commodity price levels within those regions.
Our value-added export and other chicken products sales accounted for 10.4% of
our total U.S. chicken sales in 2013. 



Our
primary customer markets consist of the foodservice and retail channels
 as well
as selected export and other markets. 
Our foodservice market principally
consists of chain restaurants
 food processors
 broad-line distributors and
certain other institutions located throughout the continental U.S. Within this
market
 we service frozen
 fresh and corporate accounts. Fresh and frozen
chicken products are usually pre-cut to customer specifications and are often
marinated to enhance value and product differentiation. Corporate accounts
include further-processed and value-added products supplied to select
foodservice customers
 improving their ability to manage product consistency and
quality in a cost efficient manner. We believe we are positioned to be the
primary or secondary supplier to national and international chain restaurants
who require multiple suppliers of chicken products. Additionally
 we believe we
are well suited to be the sole supplier for many regional chain restaurants.
Regional chain restaurants often offer better margin opportunities and a growing
base of business. We believe we have operational strengths in terms of full-line
product capabilities
 high-volume production capacities
 research and
development expertise and extensive distribution and marketing experience are
competitive strengths compared to smaller and non-vertically integrated
producers. Foodservice growth is anticipated to continue
 despite the effects
resulting from continued weak economic conditions in the U.S. 
Our retail market consists primarily
of grocery store chains
 wholesale clubs and other retail distributors. Our
retail market products consist primarily of branded
 prepackaged cut-up and
whole chicken and chicken parts. We concentrate our efforts in this market on
creating value for our customers through category management and supporting key
customers in expanding their private label sales programs. Additionally
 for
many years
 we have invested in both trade and retail marketing designed to
establish high levels of brand name awareness and consumer preference. We
utilize numerous advertising and marketing techniques to develop and strengthen
trade and consumer awareness and increase brand loyalty for consumer products
marketed under the Gold Kist
 County Post
Pierce Chicken
 Pilgrim&#146;s Pride
brands. We believe our efforts to achieve and maintain brand awareness and
loyalty help to achieve greater price premiums than would otherwise be the case
in certain markets and support and expand our product distribution. We actively
seek to identify and address consumer preferences by using sophisticated
qualitative and quantitative consumer research techniques in key geographic
markets to discover and validate new product ideas
 packaging designs and
methods. 
Our export and other chicken market
consists primarily of customers who purchase for distribution in the U.S. or for
export to Mexico
 the Middle East
 Asia
 countries within the CIS and other
world markets. Our value-added export and other chicken products
 with the
exception of our exported prepared chicken products
 consist of whole chickens
and chicken parts sold in bulk
 or value-added form
 either refrigerated or
frozen. We believe that U.S. chicken exports will continue to grow as worldwide
demand increases for high-quality
 low-cost meat protein sources. We expect that
worldwide demand for higher-margin prepared food products will increase over the
next several years and believe our strategy of value-added export growth
positions us to take advantage of this expected demand. 
Historically
 we have targeted
international markets to generate additional demand for our dark chicken meat
for which there has been less demand in the U.S. than for white chicken meat. We
have expanded our portfolio to provide prepared chicken products tailored for
export to the international divisions of our U.S. chain restaurant customers
 as
well as newly identified customers in regions not previously accessed. Through
our relationship with JBS USA
 we have developed an international distribution
channel focused on growing our tailored export program and expanding value-added
products such as all-vegetable-fed whole griller birds
 chicken franks and
further processed thigh meat. Utilizing the extensive sales network of JBS USA
we believe that we can accelerate the sales of value-added chicken products into
these international channels. 
The following table sets forth
 for
the periods beginning with 2009
 net sales attributable to each of our primary
product lines and markets served with those products. We based the table on our
internal sales reports and their classification of product types.

In December 2009
 we changed our
      fiscal year end from the Saturday nearest September 30 of each year to the
      last Sunday in December of each year. The change was effective for our
      2010 fiscal year
 which began December 28
 2009 and ended December 26
      2010 and resulted in an approximate three-month transition period which
      began September 27
 2009 and ended December 27
2009.
The following table sets forth
beginning with 2009
 the percentage of net U.S. chicken sales attributable to
each of our primary product lines and the markets serviced with those products.
We based the table and related discussion on our internal sales reports and
their classification of product types and customers.

In December 2009
 we changed our
      fiscal year end from the Saturday nearest September 30 of each year to the
      last Sunday in December of each year. The change was effective for our
      2010 fiscal year
 which began December 28

Fresh chicken is an important component of our sales and accounted for $4
123.1
million
 or 59.9%
 of our total U.S. chicken sales in 2013 and $3
113.1 million
or 51.3%
 in 2009. Most fresh chicken products are sold to established
customers
 based upon certain weekly or monthly market prices reported by the
USDA and other public price reporting services
 plus a markup
 which is
dependent upon the customer&#146;s location
 volume
 product specifications and other
factors. We believe our practices with respect to sales of fresh chicken are
generally consistent with those of our competitors. The majority of these
products are sold pursuant to agreements with varying terms that set a price
according to formulas based on underlying chicken price markets
 subject in many
cases to minimum and maximum prices.

Prepared Chicken
 In 2013
 $2
046.7
million
 or 29.7%
 of our U.S. chicken sales were in prepared chicken products
to foodservice customers and retail distributors
 as compared to $2
294.6
million
 or 37.9%
 in 2009. The production and sale in the U.S. of prepared
chicken products reduce the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our
profitability. Feed ingredient costs are the single largest component of our
U.S. cost of sales
 representing approximately 46.1% of our U.S. cost of sales
in 2013. The production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected
primarily by the global level of supply inventories
 demand for feed
ingredients
 the agricultural policies of the U.S. and foreign governments and
weather patterns throughout the world. As further processing is performed
 feed
ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product&#146;s total production
cost
 thereby reducing their impact on our profitability. Products sold in this
form enable us to charge a premium
 reduce the impact of feed ingredient costs
on our profitability and improve and stabilize our profit
margins.



We
establish prices for our prepared chicken products based primarily upon
perceived value to the customer
 production costs and prices of competing
products. The majority of these products are sold pursuant to agreements with
varying terms that either set a fixed price for short-term periods or set a
price according to formulas based on an underlying commodity market such as corn
and chicken price forecasts
 subject in many cases to minimum and maximum
prices. Many times
 these prices are dependent upon the customer&#146;s location
volume
 product specifications and other factors. 
Value-Added Export and
Other Chicken Products Overview.
Our value-added export and other products consist of whole chickens and chicken
parts sold primarily in bulk
 nonbranded form
 either refrigerated to
distributors in the U.S. or frozen for distribution to export markets
 and
branded and nonbranded prepared chicken products for distribution to export
markets. In 2013
 approximately $716.0 million
 or 10.4%
 of our total U.S.
chicken sales were attributable to U.S. chicken export and other products
 as
compared to $656.3 million
 or 10.8%
 in 2009.
Markets for Other Products

Presently
 this category includes
chicken by-products
 which we convert into protein products and sell primarily
to manufacturers of pet foods. In addition
 many of our U.S. feed mills produce
and sell some livestock feeds to local dairy farmers and livestock producers.
Until November 2011
 this category also included products sold through our
distribution centers. In 2011
 we had regional distribution centers located in
Arizona
 Texas and Utah that were primarily focused on distributing our own
chicken products. In November 2011
 we sold the distribution centers to JBS
Trading International
 Inc.
 a wholly owned subsidiary of JBS USA. See &#147;Note 16.
Related Party Transactions&#148; of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in
this annual report for additional information on the sale of the distribution
centers. In addition
 we marketed fresh eggs under private labels
 in various
sizes of cartons and flats to U.S. retail grocery and institutional foodservice
customers located primarily in Texas through August 2012. In August 2012
 we
sold our commercial egg operation to Cal-Maine Foods
 Inc. 


Our Mexico operations generated
approximately 10.8% of our net sales in 2013. We are one of the largest
producers and sellers of chicken in Mexico. We believe we operate one of the
more efficient models for chicken production in Mexico.

While the market for chicken
products in Mexico is less developed than in the U.S.
 with sales attributed to
fewer
 simpler products
 we have been successful in differentiating our products
through high-quality client service and product improvements. Additionally
 we
are an important player in the live market
 which accounts for approximately 33%
of the chicken sales in Mexico. 

We sell our chicken products
primarily to wholesalers
 large restaurant chains
 fast food accounts
supermarket chains and direct retail distribution in selected markets. Our
largest presence is by far in the central states of the country where we have
been able to gain market share. Our presence in Mexico reaches 72.0% of the
population. 
Foreign Operations Risks

Our foreign operations pose special
risks to our business and operations. A discussion of foreign operations risks
is included in &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#148; 

Our two largest customers accounted
for approximately 15.9% of our net sales in 2013. No customer accounted for ten
percent or more of our net sales in 2013. 

Competitive Conditions

The chicken industry is highly
competitive. We are one of the largest chicken producers in the world and we
believe our relationship with JBS USA enhances our competitive position. In the
U.S. and Mexico
 we compete principally with other vertically integrated poultry
companies. However
 there is some competition with non-vertically integrated
further processors in the U.S. prepared chicken
business. We believe vertical integration generally provides significant
long-term cost and quality advantages over non-vertically integrated further
processors. 



In
general
 the competitive factors in the U.S. chicken industry include price
product quality
 product development
 brand identification
 breadth of product
line and customer service. Competitive factors vary by major market. In the U.S.
retail market
 we believe that product quality
 brand awareness
 customer
service and price are the primary bases of competition. In the foodservice
market
 competition is based on consistent quality
 product development
 service
and price. The export market is competitive on a global level based on price
product quality
 product tailoring
 brand identification and customer service.
Competitive factors vary by market and may be impacted further by trade
restrictions
 sanitary and phyto-sanitary issues
 brand awareness and the
relative strength or weakness of the U.S. Dollar against local currencies. We
believe that product customization
 service and price are the most critical
competitive factors for export sales. 
In Mexico
 where product
differentiation has traditionally been limited
 we believe product quality and
price have been the most critical competitive factors. 
Restructuring Efforts

Since January 2010
 we implemented
significant operational changes to reduce costs and operate more efficiently
 as
well as realized substantial benefits through synergies following the JBS USA
acquisition. We reduced our production footprint to mitigate capacity
utilization and efficiency issues created by previously enacted across-the-board
production cuts. In addition
 we continue to evaluate our noncore businesses
which has resulted in the sale of certain noncore businesses. Exit and disposal
activities from January 2010 to present have eliminated approximately 1
500
positions and recognized net pre-tax charges totaling $115.6 million.

We continue to review and evaluate
various restructuring and other alternatives to streamline our operations
improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Such initiatives may include selling
assets
 consolidating operations and functions and voluntary and involuntary
employee separation programs. Any such actions may require us to obtain the
pre-approval of our lenders under our credit facilities. In addition
 such
actions will subject the Company to additional short-term costs
 which may
include asset impairment charges
 lease commitment costs
 employee retention and
severance costs and other costs. Certain of these activities may have a
disproportionate impact on our income relative to the cost savings in a
particular period. 
Regulation and Environmental Matters

The chicken industry is subject to
government regulation
 particularly in the health
 workplace safety and
environmental areas
 including provisions relating to the discharge of materials
into the environment
 by the Centers for Disease Control
 the USDA
 the Food and
Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;)
 the Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) and
state and local regulatory authorities in the U.S. and by similar governmental
agencies in Mexico. Our chicken processing facilities in the U.S. are subject to
on-site examination
 inspection and regulation by the USDA. The FDA inspects the
production of our feed mills in the U.S. Our Mexican food processing facilities
and feed mills are subject to on-site examination
 inspection and regulation by
a Mexican governmental agency that performs functions similar to those performed
by the USDA and FDA. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations relating to the operations of our facilities.

Our operations are subject to
extensive regulation by the EPA and other state and local authorities relating
to handling and discharge of waste water
 storm water
 air emissions
 treatment
storage and disposal of wastes
 handling of hazardous substances and remediation
of contaminated soil
 surface water and groundwater. Our Mexican operations also
are subject to extensive regulation by Mexican environmental authorities. The
EPA and/or other U.S. or Mexican state and local authorities may
 from time to
time
 adopt revisions to environmental rules and regulations
 and/or changes in
the terms and conditions of our environmental permits
 with which we must
comply. Compliance with existing or new environmental requirements
 including
more stringent limitations imposed or expected in recently-renewed or soon-to be
renewed environmental permits
 may require capital expenditures and operating
expenses which may be significant. Our operations are also subject to regulation
by the EPA
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#147;OSHA&#148;) and other
state and local regulatory authorities regarding the treatment and disposal of
agricultural and food processing wastes
 the use and maintenance of
refrigeration systems
 including ammonia-based chillers
 noise
 odor and dust
management
 the operation of mechanized processing equipment
 and other
operations. 




Some of our
facilities have been operating for many years
 and were built before current
environmental
 health and safety standards were imposed and/or in areas that
recently have become subject to residential and commercial development
pressures. We are upgrading wastewater treatment facilities at a number of our
facilities
 either pursuant to consent agreements with regulatory authorities or
on a voluntary basis in anticipation of future permit requirements. We do not
anticipate that the capital expenditures associated with these upgrades
 which
will be spread over a number of years
 will be material. 
We have from
time to time had incidents at our plants involving worker health and safety.
These have included ammonia releases due to mechanical failures in chiller
systems and worker injuries and fatalities involving processing equipment and
vehicle accidents. We have taken preventive measures in response. 
Some of our
properties have been impacted by contamination from spills or other releases
and we have incurred costs to remediate such contamination. In addition
 in the
past we acquired businesses with operations such as pesticide and fertilizer
production that involved greater use of hazardous materials and generation of
more hazardous wastes than our current operations. While many of those
operations have been sold or closed
 some environmental laws impose strict and
in certain circumstances
 joint and several liability for costs of investigation
and remediation of contaminated sites on current and former owners and operators
of the sites
 and on persons who arranged for disposal of wastes at such sites.
In addition
 current owners or operators of such contaminated sites may seek to
recover cleanup costs from us based on past operations or contractual
indemnifications. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#148; for risks associated with
compliance with existing or changing environmental requirement. 
We anticipate
increased regulation by the USDA concerning food safety
 by the FDA concerning
the use of medications in feed and by the EPA and various other state agencies
concerning discharges to the environment. Although we do not currently
anticipate that such increased regulation will have a material adverse effect
upon us
 new environmental
 health and safety requirements that are more
stringent than we anticipate
 stricter interpretations of existing environmental
requirements
 or obligations related to the investigation or clean-up of
contaminated sites may materially affect our business or operations in the
future. 
Employees

As of
December 29
 2013
 we employed approximately 31
600 persons in the U.S. and
approximately 5
100 persons in Mexico. Approximately 35.3% of the Company&#146;s
employees were covered under collective bargaining agreements. Substantially all
employees covered under collective bargaining agreements are covered under
with
the exception of one live operations location where the collective bargaining
agreement expired in 2013 and negotiations are ongoing. We have not experienced
any labor-related work stoppage at any location in over 
years. We believe our relationship with our employees and union leadership is
 one
location
 and there is no assurance that agreement will be reached. In the
absence of an agreement
 we may become subject to labor disruption at this
location
 which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

Forward Looking
Statements 
Certain
written and oral statements made by our Company and subsidiaries of our Company
may constitute &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; as defined under the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This includes statements made herein
in our other filings with the SEC
 in press releases
 and in certain other oral
and written presentations. 
Statements of
our intentions

 expectations or predictions for the future
 denoted by
the words &#147;anticipate
&#148; &#147;believe
&#148; &#147;estimate
&#148; &#147;expect

&#148; &#147;should
&#148; &#147;foresee&#148; and similar expressions
 are
forward-looking statements that reflect our current views about future events
and are subject to risks
 uncertainties and assumptions. Such risks
uncertainties and assumptions include those described under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; below
and elsewhere in this annual report. 
Actual
results could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking
statements as a result of these factors
 among others
 many of which are beyond
our control. 
In making
these statements
 we are not undertaking
 and specifically decline to undertake
any obligation to address or update each or any factor in future filings or
communications regarding our business or results
 and we are not undertaking to
address how any of these factors may have caused changes in information
contained in previous filings or communications. The risks described below are
not the only risks we face
 and additional risks and uncertainties may also
impair our business operations. The occurrence of any one or more of the
following or other currently unknown factors could materially adversely affect
our business and operating results. 
Risk Factors

The following
risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business
and the forward-looking information contained in this annual report on Form
10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business
operations
 industry or financial position or our future financial performance.
While we believe we have identified and discussed below all risk factors
affecting our business that we believe are material
 there may be additional
risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently
believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business
 operations
industry
 financial position and financial performance in the future.

Industry cyclicality can
affect our earnings
 especially due to fluctuations in commodity prices of feed
ingredients and chicken. 
Profitability
in the chicken industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed
ingredients and market prices of chicken
 which are determined by supply and
demand factors. As a result
 the chicken industry is subject to cyclical
earnings fluctuations. 



The price of
feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by the global
level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients
 the agricultural
policies of the U.S. and foreign governments and weather patterns throughout the
world. In particular
 weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in
an unpredictable manner. A significant change in weather patterns could affect
supplies of feed ingredients
 as well as both the industry&#146;s and our ability to
obtain feed ingredients
 grow chickens or deliver products. More recently
 feed
prices have been impacted by increased demand both domestically for ethanol and
globally for protein production
 as well as grain production levels outside the
U.S. 
Market prices
for feed ingredients remained at historically high levels throughout 2011
 2012
and most of 2013. Market prices for feed ingredients remain volatile.
Consequently
 there can be no assurance that the price of corn or soybean meal
will not continue to rise as a result of
 among other things
 increasing demand
for these products around the world and alternative uses of these products
 such
as ethanol and biodiesel production. 
Volatility in
feed ingredient prices has had
 and may continue to have
 a materially adverse
effect on our operating results
 which has resulted in
 and may continue to
result in
 additional noncash expenses due to impairment of the carrying amounts
of certain of our assets. We periodically seek
 to the extent available
 to
enter into advance purchase commitments or financial derivative contracts for
the purchase of feed ingredients in an effort to manage our feed ingredient
costs. The use of these instruments may not be successful. In addition
 we have
not designated the derivative financial instruments that we have purchased to
mitigate commodity purchase exposures as cash flow hedges. Therefore
 we
recognize changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments
immediately in earnings. Unexpected changes in the fair value of these
instruments could adversely affect the results of our operations. Although we
have sought to mitigate the impact of feed price volatility on our profitability
by decreasing the amount of our products that are sold under longer term fixed
price contracts
 these changes will not eliminate the impact of changes in feed
ingredient prices on our profitability and would prevent us from profiting on
such contracts during times of declining market prices of chicken. 
Outbreaks of livestock
diseases in general and poultry diseases in particular
 including avian
influenza
 can significantly affect our ability to conduct our operations and
demand for our products. 
We take
precautions designed to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our
processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and
environmentally-sound manner. However
 events beyond our control
 such as the
outbreaks of disease
 either in our own flocks or elsewhere
 could significantly
affect demand for our products or our ability to conduct our operations.
Furthermore
 an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on
the import and export of our fresh chicken or other products to or from our
suppliers
 facilities or customers
 or require us to destroy one or more of our
flocks. This could also result in the cancellation of orders by our customers
and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our
ability to market our products successfully and on our business
 reputation and
prospects. 
During 2012
and 2013
 there was substantial publicity regarding a highly pathogenic strain
of avian influenza
 known as H7N3
 which affected several states in central
Mexico. There are several hypotheses about the cause of the outbreak in Mexico
including transmission from wild birds or the possibility of introduction
through poultry trade. Approximately 85% of the birds affected were table egg
laying hens
 a component of the industry in which Pilgrim's does not
participate. The Mexican government and poultry industry culled approximately
28.3 million birds. The disease was found in approximately 90 commercial
facilities
 including one Pilgrim's breeder farm. The Mexican government and
poultry industry undertook an extensive vaccination program with the goal of
administering approximately 210 million doses per month. To prevent further
spread
 the Mexican government also authorized the administration of 205 million
birds in nine Mexican states
with priority given to progenitor birds (producing breeder hens)
 breeders
(producing broiler chicks and layer chicks for table eggs) and layers.

During the
first half of 2013
 there was also substantial publicity regarding a low
pathogenic strain of avian influenza
 known as H7N9
 which affected eastern and
northern China in and around the cities of Shanghai and Beijing. It is widely
believed that H7N9 circulates in wild birds and may be transmitted to domestic
poultry. H7N9 is also believed to have passed from birds to humans as humans
came into contact with live birds that were infected with the disease. There
were 133 confirmed cases
 including 43 deaths
 of H7N9 infection in humans
related to this outbreak. 
Although
neither H7N3 nor H7N9 has been identified in the U.S.
 there have been outbreaks
of other low pathogenic strains of avian influenza in the U.S.
 and in Mexico
outbreaks of both high and low-pathogenic strains of avian influenza are a
fairly common occurrence. Historically
 the outbreaks of low pathogenic strains
of avian influenza have not generated the same level of concern
 or received the
same level of publicity or been accompanied by the same reduction in demand for
poultry products in certain countries as that associated with highly pathogenic
strains such as H7N3 or highly infectious strains such as H7N9. Even if the H7N3
or H7N9 strains of avian influenza do not spread to the U.S.
 there can be no
assurance that these outbreaks will not materially adversely affect demand for
U.S.-produced poultry internationally and/or domestically
 and
 if it were to
spread to the U.S.
 there can be no assurance that it would not significantly
affect our ability to conduct our operations and/or demand for our products
 in
each case in a manner having a material adverse effect on our business
reputation and/or prospects.



If our poultry products
become contaminated
 we may be subject to product liability claims and product
recalls. 
Poultry
products may be subject to contamination by disease-producing organisms
 or
pathogens
Listeria
monocytogenes
. These pathogens
are generally found in the environment
 and
 as a result
 there is a risk that
as a result of food processing
 they could be present in our processed poultry
products. These pathogens can also be introduced as a result of improper
handling at the further processing
 foodservice or consumer level. These risks
may be controlled
 although not eliminated
 by adherence to good manufacturing
practices and finished product testing. We have little
 if any
 control over
proper handling once the product has been shipped. Illness and death may result
if the pathogens are not eliminated at the further processing
 foodservice or
consumer level. Even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products is a
violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability
claims
 product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory
agencies and may have a material adverse effect on our business
 reputation and
prospects. 
Product liability claims
or product recalls can adversely affect our business reputation
 expose us to
increased scrutiny by federal and state regulators and may not be fully covered
by insurance. 
The
packaging
 marketing and distribution of food products entail an inherent risk
of product liability and product recall and the resultant adverse publicity. We
may be subject to significant liability if the consumption of any of our
products causes injury
 illness or death. We could be required to recall certain
products in the event of contamination or damage to the products. In addition to
the risks of product liability or product recall due to deficiencies caused by
our production or processing operations
 we may encounter the same risks if any
third party tampers with our products. There can be no assurance that we will
not be required to perform product recalls
 or that product liability claims
will not be asserted against us
 in the future. Any claims that may be made may
create adverse publicity that would have a material adverse effect on our
ability to market our products successfully or on our business
 reputation
prospects
 financial condition and results of operations. 
If our
poultry products become contaminated
 we may be subject to product liability
claims and product recalls. There can be no assurance that any litigation or
reputational injury associated with product recalls will not have a material
adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our
business
 reputation
 prospects
 financial condition and results of operations.

We currently
maintain insurance with respect to certain of these risks
 including product
liability insurance
 property insurance
 workers compensation insurance
business interruption insurance and general liability insurance
 but in many
cases such insurance is expensive
 difficult to obtain and no assurance can be
given that such insurance can be maintained in the future on acceptable terms
or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to any such events
 or
at all. Moreover
 even though our insurance coverage may be designed to protect
us from losses attributable to certain events
 it may not adequately protect us
from liability and expenses we incur in connection with such events. 
Competition in the
chicken industry with other vertically integrated poultry companies may make us
unable to compete successfully in these industries
 which could adversely affect
our business. 
The chicken
industry is highly competitive. In both the U.S. and Mexico
 we primarily
compete with other vertically integrated chicken companies. 
In general
the competitive factors in the U.S. chicken industry include price
 product
quality
 product development
 brand identification
 breadth of product line and
customer service. Competitive factors vary by major market. In the foodservice
market
 competition is based on consistent quality
 product development
 service
and price. In the U.S. retail market
 we believe that competition is based on
product quality
 brand awareness
 customer service and price. Further
 there is
some competition with non-vertically integrated further processors in the
prepared chicken business. In Mexico
 where product differentiation has
traditionally been limited
 we believe product quality and price have been the
most critical competitive factors. 
The loss of one or more
of our largest customers could adversely affect our business. 
Our two
largest customers accounted for approximately 15.9% of our net sales in 2013.
Our business could suffer significant setbacks in revenues and operating income
if we lost one or more of our largest customers
 or if our customers&#146; plans
and/or markets should change significantly. 



Our foreign operations
pose special risks to our business and operations. 
We have
significant operations and assets located in Mexico and may participate in or
acquire operations and assets in other foreign countries in the future. Foreign
operations are subject to a number of special risks such as currency exchange
rate fluctuations
 trade barriers
 exchange controls
 expropriation and changes
in laws and policies
 including tax laws and laws governing foreign-owned
operations. 
Currency
exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected us in the past. Exchange rate
fluctuations or one or more other risks may have a material adverse effect on
our business or operations in the future. 
Our
operations in Mexico are conducted through subsidiaries organized under the laws
of Mexico. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries
 including trade creditors
will generally have priority as to the assets of our subsidiaries over our
claims. Additionally
 the ability of our Mexican subsidiaries to make payments
and distributions to us may be limited by the terms of our Mexico credit
facility and will be subject to
 among other things
 Mexican law. In the past
these laws have not had a material adverse effect on the ability of our Mexican
subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions. However
 laws such as
these may have a material adverse effect on the ability of our Mexican
subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions in the future. 
Disruptions in
international markets and distribution channels could adversely affect our
business. 
Historically
we have targeted international markets to generate additional demand for our
products. In particular
 given U.S. customers&#146; general preference for white
meat
 we have targeted international markets for the sale of dark chicken meat
specifically leg quarters
 which are a natural by-product of our U.S.
operations&#146; concentration on prepared chicken products. As part of this
initiative
 we have created a significant international distribution network
into several markets in Mexico
 the Middle East
 Asia and countries within the
CIS. Our success in these markets may be
 and our success in recent periods has
been
 adversely affected by disruptions in chicken export markets. For example
China imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on the U.S. chicken
producers in 2010
 which have deterred Chinese importers from purchases of
U.S.-origin chicken products. Additionally
 from time to time Russia has
restricted the importation of U.S. poultry products for the protection of their
domestic poultry producers and in cases of allegations of consumer health
issues. 
A significant
risk is disruption due to import restrictions and tariffs
 other trade
protection measures
 and import or export licensing requirements. In addition
disruptions may be caused by outbreaks of disease such as avian influenza
either in our flocks or elsewhere in the world
 and resulting changes in
consumer preferences. 
One or more
of these or other disruptions in the international markets and distribution
channels could adversely affect our business or operations. 
Regulation
 present and
future
 is a constant factor affecting our business. 
Our
operations will continue to be subject to federal
 state and local governmental
regulation
 including in the health
 safety and environmental areas. We
anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety
 the
use of medication in feed formulations and the disposal of chicken by-products
and wastewater discharges. Also
 changes in laws or regulations or the
application thereof may lead to government enforcement actions and the resulting
litigation by private litigants
 such as various wage and hour and environmental
issues. 
In addition
unknown matters
 new laws and regulations
 or stricter interpretations of
existing laws or regulations may also materially affect our business or
operations in the future. 
New immigration
legislation or increased enforcement efforts in connection with existing
immigration legislation could cause the costs of doing business to increase
cause us to change the way we conduct our business or otherwise disrupt our
operations. 
Immigration
reform continues to attract significant attention in the public arena and the
U.S. Congress. If new federal immigration legislation is enacted or if states in
which we do business enact immigration laws
 such laws may contain provisions
that could make it more difficult or costly for us to hire U.S. citizens and/or
legal immigrant workers. In such case
 we may incur additional costs to run our
business or may have to change the way we conduct our operations
 either of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business
 operating results
and financial condition. Also
 despite our past and continuing efforts to hire
only U.S. citizens and/or persons legally authorized to work in the U.S.
 we may
be unable to ensure that all of our employees are U.S. citizens and/or persons
legally authorized to work in the U.S. For example
 U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement has investigated identity theft within our workforce. With our
cooperation
 during 2008 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested
approximately 300 employees believed to have engaged in identity theft at five
of our facilities. No assurances can be given that enforcement efforts by
governmental authorities will not disrupt a portion of our workforce or
operations at one or more facilities
 thereby negatively impacting our business.
Also
 no assurance can be given that further enforcement efforts by governmental
authorities will not result in the assessment of fines that could adversely
affect our financial position
 operating results or cash flows.



Loss of essential
employees could have a significant negative impact on our business.

Our success
is largely dependent on the skills
 experience
 and efforts of our management
and other employees. The loss of the services of one or more members of our
senior management or of numerous employees with essential skills could have a
negative effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.
If we are not able to retain or attract talented
 committed individuals to fill
vacant positions when needs arise
 it may adversely affect our ability to
achieve our business objectives. 
Our performance depends
on favorable labor relations with our employees and our compliance with labor
laws. Any deterioration of those relations or increase in labor costs due to our
compliance with labor laws could adversely affect our business. 
As of
December 29
 2013
 we employed approximately 31
600 persons in the U.S. and
approximately 5
100 persons in Mexico. Approximately 35.3% of the Company&#146;s
employees were covered under collective bargaining agreements. Substantially all
employees covered under collective bargaining agreements are covered under
with
the exception of one live operations location where the collective bargaining
agreement expired in 2013 and negotiations are ongoing. We have not experienced
any labor-related work stoppage at any location in over 
years. We believe our relationship with our employees and union leadership is
satisfactory. At any given time
 we will be in some stage of contract
negotiations with various collective bargaining units. The Company is currently
 one location
 and there is no assurance that
agreement will be reached. In the absence of an agreement
 we may become subject
to labor disruption at this location
 which could have an adverse effect on our
financial results. 
Extreme weather
 natural
disasters or other events beyond our control could negatively impact our
business. 
Bioterrorism
fire
 pandemic
 extreme weather or natural disasters
 including droughts
floods
 excessive cold or heat
 hurricanes or other storms
 could impair the
health or growth of our flocks
 production or availability of feed ingredients
or interfere with our operations due to power outages
 fuel shortages
 damage to
our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation
channels
 among other things. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect
on our financial results. 
We may face significant
costs for compliance with existing or changing environmental
 health and safety
requirements and for potential environmental obligations relating to current or
discontinued operations. 
Our
operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal
 state
local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the
environment
 including those relating to the discharge of materials into the
environment
 the handling
 treatment and disposal of wastes and remediation of
soil and groundwater contamination. Failure to comply with these requirements
could have serious consequences for us
 including criminal as well as civil and
administrative penalties
 claims for property damage
 personal injury and damage
to natural resources and negative publicity. Compliance with existing or
changing environmental requirements
 including more stringent limitations
imposed or expected to be imposed in recently-renewed or soon-to be renewed
environmental permits
 will require capital expenditures for installation of new
or upgraded pollution control equipment at some of our facilities. 
Operations at
many of our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater
stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes
 the use and maintenance
of refrigeration systems
 including ammonia-based chillers
 noise
 odor and dust
management
 the operation of mechanized processing equipment
 and other
operations that potentially could affect the environment
 health and safety.
Some of our facilities have been operating for many years
 and were built before
current environmental standards were imposed
 and/or in areas that recently have
become subject to residential and commercial development pressures. Failure to
comply with current and future environmental
 health and safety standards could
result in the imposition of fines and penalties
 and we have been subject to
such sanctions from time to time. We are upgrading wastewater treatment
facilities at a number of these locations
 either pursuant to consent agreements
with regulatory authorities or on a voluntary basis in anticipation of future
permit requirements. 
In the past
we have acquired businesses with operations such as pesticide and fertilizer
production that involved greater use of hazardous materials and generation of
more hazardous wastes than our current operations. While many of those
operations have been sold or closed
 some environmental laws impose strict and
in certain circumstances
 joint and several liability for costs of investigation
and remediation of contaminated sites on current and former owners and operators
of the sites
 and on persons who arranged for disposal of wastes at such sites.
In addition
 current owners or operators of such contaminated sites may seek to
recover cleanup costs from us based on past operations or contractual
indemnifications. 



New
environmental
 health and safety requirements
 stricter interpretations of
existing requirements
 or obligations related to the investigation or clean-up
of contaminated sites
 may materially affect our business or operations in the
future. 
JBS USA holds a majority
of our common stock and has the ability to control the vote on most matters
brought before the holders of our common stock. 
JBS USA holds
a majority of the shares and voting power of our common stock and is entitled to
appoint a majority of the members of our board of directors. As a result
 JBS
USA will
 subject to restrictions on its voting power and actions in a
stockholders agreement between us and JBS USA and our organization documents
have the ability to control our management
 policies and financing decisions
elect a majority of the members of our board of directors at the annual meeting
and control the vote on most matters coming before the holders of our common
stock. 
Under the
stockholders agreement between us and JBS USA
 JBS USA has the ability to elect
up to six members of our board of directors and the other holders of our common
stock have the ability to elect up to three members of our board of directors.
If the percentage of our outstanding common stock owned by JBS USA exceeds 80%
then JBS USA would have the ability to elect one additional member of our board
of directors while the other holders of our common stock would have the ability
to elect one less member of our board of directors. 
Our operations are
subject to general risks of litigation. 
We are
involved on an on-going basis in litigation with our independent contract
growers or arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. See &#147;Item 3.
Legal Proceedings.&#148; Trends in litigation may include class actions involving
consumers
 shareholders
 employees or injured persons
 and claims relating to
commercial
 labor
 employment
 antitrust
 securities or environmental matters.
Litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty
 and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect our
financial results. 
We depend on contract
growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock. 
We contract
primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens processed
in our poultry operations. If we do not attract and maintain contracts with
growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent
producers
 our production operations could be negatively affected. 
Changes in consumer
preference could negatively impact our business. 
The food
industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends
 demands and
preferences. Trends within the food industry change often
 and failure to
identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to
 among other things
reduced demand and price reductions for our products
 and could have an adverse
effect on our financial results. 
The consolidation of
customers could negatively impact our business. 
Our
customers
 such as supermarkets
 warehouse clubs and food distributors
 have
consolidated in recent years
 and consolidation is expected to continue
throughout the U.S. and in other major markets. These consolidations have
produced large
 sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more
capable of operating with reduced inventories
 opposing price increases
 and
demanding lower pricing
 increased promotional programs and specifically
tailored products. These customers also may use shelf space currently used for
our products for their own private label products. Because of these trends
 our
volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional
spending for our products
 any of which would adversely affect our financial
results. 
Our future financial and
operating flexibility may be adversely affected by our significant leverage.

We have
substantial indebtedness
 which could adversely affect our financial condition.
On a consolidated basis
 as of December 29
 2013
 we had approximately $414.5
million in secured indebtedness
 $497.8 million of unsecured indebtedness and
had the ability to borrow approximately $665.8 million under our credit
agreements. Significant amounts of cash flow will be necessary to make payments
of interest and repay the principal amount of such indebtedness. 
The degree to which we are
leveraged could have important consequences because: 
It could affect our ability to satisfy

A substantial portion of our cash flow
  from operations is required to be dedicated to interest and principal payments
  and may not be available for operations
 working capital
 capital
  expenditures
 expansion
 acquisitions or general corporate or other
  purposes;



Our ability to obtain additional
  financing and to fund working capital
 capital expenditures and other general

We may be more highly leveraged than
  some of our competitors
 which may place us at a competitive

Our flexibility in planning for
 or
  reacting to

It may limit our ability to pursue

It may make us more vulnerable in the
  event of a continued or new downturn in our business or the economy in
  general.
Our ability
to make payments on and to refinance our debt
 including our credit facilities
will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This
 to a certain
extent
 is subject to various business factors (including
 among others
 the
commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken) and general economic
financial
 competitive
 legislative
 regulatory
 and other factors that are
beyond our control. 
There can be
no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations or that future borrowings will be available under our credit
facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt obligations
including obligations under our credit facilities
 or to fund our other
liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of their debt on or
before maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any
of their debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
Media campaigns related
to food production present risks. 
Individuals
or organizations can use social media platforms to publicize inappropriate or
inaccurate stories or perceptions about the food production industry or our
company. Such practices could cause damage to the reputations of our company
and/or the food production industry in general. This damage could adversely
affect our financial results.

Grower Claims and
Proceedings 
Ricky
Arnold et al. v. Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Corp.
 On September 10
 2008
 a lawsuit styled &#147;Ricky
Arnold
 et al. v. Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Corp.
 et al.&#148; was filed against our Company
and two of its representatives. In this lawsuit
 filed in the Circuit Court of
Van Buren County
 Arkansas
 nearly 100 contract poultry growers and their
spouses assert claims of fraud and deceit
 constructive fraud
 fraud in the
inducement
 promissory estoppel
 and violations of the Arkansas Livestock and
Poultry Contract Protection Act relating to the idling of our Clinton
 Arkansas
processing plant. The total amount of damages sought by the contract poultry
growers is unliquidated and unknown at this time. We filed a Notice of
Suggestion of Bankruptcy. The court has not issued an order in response to it.
The plaintiffs filed proofs of claim in the Bankruptcy Court
 and we filed
objections to the proofs of claim. The plaintiffs in the Arnold case
 and a
number of other growers from the Clinton
 Arkansas facility filed proofs of
claim in the bankruptcy case. The proofs of claim are being administered in a
consolidated proceeding described under 
below. The consolidated matter
 as discussed below
 is now
concluded.



Shelia
Adams
On June 1
 2009
 approximately 555 former and
current independent contract broiler growers
 their spouses and poultry farms
filed an adversary proceeding against us in the Bankruptcy Court styled &#147;Shelia
Adams
 et al. v. Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Corporation.&#148; In the adversary proceeding
 the
plaintiffs assert claims against us for: (i) violations of Sections 202(a)
 (b)
and (e)
 7 US C. &#167; 192 of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 (the &#147;PSA&#148;);
(ii) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (iii) violations of the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices Act (&#147;DTPA&#148;); (iv) promissory estoppel; (v) simple
fraud; and (vi) fraud by nondisclosure. The case relates to our Farmerville
Louisiana; Nacogdoches
 Texas; and the El Dorado
 De Queen and Batesville
Arkansas complexes. The plaintiffs also filed a motion to withdraw the reference
of the adversary proceeding from the Bankruptcy Court to the U.S. District for
the Eastern Court of Texas (&#147;Marshall Court&#148;). The motion was filed with the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas-Fort Worth Division (the
&#147;Fort Worth Court&#148;). The Bankruptcy Court recommended the reference be
withdrawn
 but that the Fort Worth Court retain venue over the action to ensure
against forum shopping. The Fort Worth Court granted the motion to withdraw the
reference. We filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&#146; claims. The Fort Worth
Court granted in part and denied in part our motion
 dismissing the following
claims and ordering the plaintiffs to file a motion to amend their lawsuit and
re-plead their claims with further specificity or the claims would be dismissed
with prejudice: (i) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (ii)
promissory estoppel; (iii) simple fraud and fraudulent nondisclosure; and (iv)
DTPA claims with respect to growers from Oklahoma
 Arkansas
 and Louisiana. The
plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend on October 7
 2009. Plaintiffs&#146;
motion for leave was granted and the plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint on
December 7
 2009. Subsequent to the Fort Worth Court granting in part and
denying in part our motion to dismiss
 the plaintiffs filed a motion to transfer
venue of the proceeding from the Fort Worth Court to the Marshall Court. We
filed a response to the motion
 but the motion to transfer was granted on
December 17
 2009. On December 29
 2009
 we filed our answer to plaintiffs&#146;
Amended Complaint with the Marshall Court. A bench trial commenced on June 16
2011. The trial concluded as to the El Dorado growers on August 25
 2011. On
September 30
 2011
 the Marshall Court issued its Findings of Facts and
Conclusions of Law and Judgment finding in favor of the Company on each of the
grower claims with exception of claims under 7 U.S.C. &#167;192(e)
 and awarding
damages to plaintiffs in the aggregate of approximately $25.8 million.
Afterward
 the Company filed post-judgment motions attacking the trial court&#146;s
findings of fact and conclusions of law
 which
 on December 28
 2011
 were
granted in part and resulted in a reduction of the damages award from $25.8
million to $25.6 million. On January 19
 2012
 the Company appealed the findings
of fact and conclusions of law and decision concerning the post-judgment motions
to the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument occurred on
December 3
 2012. On August 27
 2013
 the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment
and entered a judgment in favor of the Company. Plaintiffs thereafter filed a
petition for rehearing en banc. Plaintiffs&#146; petition for rehearing was denied on
October 15
 2013. On January 13
 2014
 Plaintiffs filed a Petition for a Writ of
Certiorari requesting the Supreme Court of the United States to accept their
case for review. The Company is awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on
whether it will accept the case for review. If such petition is granted
 the
Company intends to vigorously pursue its appellate rights and defend against
reinstatement of the underlying judgment of the trial court. The Fifth Circuit's
decision and prior favorable trial court rulings regarding the El Dorado grower'
claims suggest that the likelihood of any recovery by growers remaining in the
case is too remote to maintain the previously-recorded loss accrual. Therefore
the Company reversed the accrual on September 1
 2013. As for the remaining
claims
 the bench trials relating to the allegations asserted by the plaintiffs
from the Farmerville
 Louisiana complex began on July 16
 2012. That bench trial
concluded on August 2
 2012. The Marshall Court has not issued a decision.
Additionally
 the bench trials relating to the claims asserted by the plaintiffs
from the Nacogdoches
 Texas complex began on September 12
 2012. The trial has
not concluded and the Marshall Court has not scheduled a date for resuming the
trial. The remaining bench trial for the plaintiffs from the De Queen and
Batesville
 Arkansas complexes was scheduled for October 29
 2012
 but that
trial date was canceled. The Marshall Court has not scheduled new dates for that
bench trial. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims.
Although the likelihood of financial loss related to the remaining growers&#146;
claims is reasonably possible
 an estimate of potential loss cannot be
determined at this time because of now conflicting legal authority
 the factual
nature of the various growers&#146; individual claims and a new judge who will
preside over the remaining bench trials. There can be no assurances that other
similar claims may not be brought against the Company. 
Grower
 Approximately
161 former independent contract broiler growers
 their spouses and poultry farms
filed proofs of claim against us relating to the idling of the Company&#146;s El
Dorado
 Arkansas; Douglas
 Georgia; Siler City and Sanford
 North Carolina; and
Athens
 Alabama processing facilities. Eight of the growers also filed
administrative claims against us. The growers&#146; claims include: (i) fraud; (ii)
fraudulent inducement; (iii) violations of the Packers &amp; Stockyards Act;
(iv) breach of fiduciary duty; (v) promissory estoppel; (vi) equitable estoppel;
(vii) restitution; and (viii) deceptive trade practices. The claims relate to
the growers&#146; allegations that they were required to spend significant amounts
improving their poultry farms in order to continue their contractual
relationship with our Company and predecessor companies. On December 17
 2009
we filed objections to the proofs of claim and administrative claims. The
parties have engaged in discovery. Since discovery commenced
 we announced that
we are reopening the Douglas
 Georgia complex. Consequently
 we circulated new
poultry grower contracts with releases to those growers that own and/or operate
poultry farms within or near Douglas
 Georgia. Because numerous growers signed
the poultry grower agreement that contained the release of their claims
approximately 133 of the 161 growers in this consolidated claims administration
proceeding withdrew their proofs of claim and motions for administrative expense claims. There
are currently approximately 48 growers in this proceeding. After engaging in
discovery motion practice and a trial
 the majority of the 48 growers&#146; claims
were dismissed. The Company subsequently settled the remaining claims.





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Numerous former independent contract growers located in our Clinton
 Arkansas
complex filed proofs of claim against us relating to the Arnold litigation
referenced above. The claims include: (i) fraud and deceit; (ii) constructive
fraud; (iii) fraud in the inducement; (iv) promissory estoppel; (v) a request
for declaratory relief; and (vi) violations of the Arkansas Livestock and
Poultry Contract Protection Act
 and relate to the growers&#146; allegations that
they were required to spend significant amounts improving their poultry farms in
order to continue their contractual relationship with our Company and
predecessor companies prior to us idling our Clinton processing facility. Most
of the growers in this consolidated claims administration proceeding were named
plaintiffs in the case styled
 &#147;Ricky Arnold
 et al. v. Pilgrim&#146;s Pride
Corporation
 et al.&#148; discussed above. On November 30
 2009
 we filed objections
to the proofs of claim. On August 2
 2010
 we filed numerous motions for summary
judgment requesting the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss each grower&#146;s causes of
action against our Company. In response to the dispositive motions
 the growers
conceded that their numerous fraud and statutory claims lacked merit;
consequently
 the parties recently submitted agreed orders dismissing these
claims with prejudice. The sole remaining cause of action alleged by the growers
against us is promissory estoppel. The hearing on our motions for summary
judgment with respect to the promissory estoppel claims occurred on October 19
2010. On December 15
 2010
 the Bankruptcy Court granted the Company&#146;s summary
judgment motion on 106 of the 107 growers&#146; promissory estoppel claims. The
Company settled with the grower whose claims were not dismissed for an
immaterial amount. The growers whose claims were dismissed appealed the decision
to the District Court
 which
 on December 19
 2011
 affirmed the Bankruptcy
Court&#146;s decision. On January 17
 2012
 the growers appealed the District Court&#146;s
decision to the United States Fifth Circuit of Court of Appeals. After briefing
was complete
 the Fifth Circuit
 on January 31
 2013
 affirmed the underlying
judgment in favor of the Company and barred the growers&#146; claims. Because the
growers elected not to seek rehearing of the Fifth Circuit&#146;s decision and will
not seek a further appeal
 the case is now concluded. 
ERISA Claims and Proceedings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
December 17
 2008
 Kenneth Patterson filed suit in the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Texas
 Marshall Division
 against Lonnie &#147;Bo&#148; Pilgrim
Lonnie Ken Pilgrim
 Clifford E. Butler
 J. Clinton Rivers
 Richard A. Cogdill
Renee N. DeBar
 our Compensation Committee and other unnamed defendants (the
&#147;Patterson action&#148;). On January 2
 2009
 a nearly identical suit was filed by
Denise M. Smalls in the same court against the same defendants (the &#147;Smalls
action&#148;). The complaints in both actions
 brought pursuant to section 502 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#147;ERISA&#148;)
 29 US C. &#167; 1132
alleged that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties to participants
and beneficiaries of the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Stock Investment Plan (the &#147;Stock
Plan&#148;)
 as administered through the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Retirement Savings Plan (the
&#147;RSP&#148;)
 and the To-Ricos
 Inc. Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (the
&#147;To-Ricos Plan&#148;) (collectively
 the &#147;Plans&#148;) by failing to sell the common stock
held by the Plans before it declined in value in late 2008. Patterson and Smalls
further alleged that they purported to represent a class of all persons or
entities who were participants in or beneficiaries of the Plans at any time
between May 5
 2008 through the present and whose accounts held our common stock
or units in our common stock. Both complaints sought actual damages in the
amount of any losses the Plans suffered
 to be allocated among the participants&#146;
individual accounts as benefits due in proportion to the accounts&#146; diminution in
value
 attorneys&#146; fees
 an order for equitable restitution and the imposition of
constructive trust
 and a declaration that each of the defendants have breached
their fiduciary duties to the Plans&#146; participants. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
July 20
 2009
 the Court entered an order consolidating the Smalls and Patterson
actions. On August 12
 2009
 the Court ordered that the consolidated case will
proceed under the caption &#147;In re Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Stock Investment Plan ERISA
Litigation
 No. 2:08-cv-472-TJW.&#148; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Patterson and Smalls filed a consolidated amended complaint (&#147;Amended
Complaint&#148;) on March 2
 2010. The Amended Complaint names as defendants the
Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Board of Directors
 Lonnie &#147;Bo&#148; Pilgrim
 Lonnie Ken Pilgrim
Charles L. Black
 Linda Chavez
 S. Key Coker
 Keith W. Hughes
 Blake D. Lovette
Vance C. Miller
 James G. Vetter
 Jr.
 Donald L. Wass
 J. Clinton Rivers
Richard A. Cogdill
 the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Pension Committee
 Robert A. Wright
Jane Brookshire
 Renee N. DeBar
 the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Administrative Committee
Gerry Evenwel
 Stacey Evans
 Evelyn Boyden
 and &#147;John Does 1-10.&#148; The Amended
Complaint purports to assert claims on behalf of persons who were participants
in or beneficiaries of the RSP or the To-Ricos Plan at any time between January
29
 2008 through December 1
 2008 (&#147;the alleged class period&#148;)
 and whose
accounts included investments in the Company&#146;s common stock. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like the original Patterson and Smalls complaints
 the Amended Complaint alleges
that the defendants breached ERISA fiduciary duties to participants and
beneficiaries of the RSP and To-Ricos Plan by permitting both Plans to continue
investing in the Company&#146;s common stock during the alleged class period. The
Amended Complaint also alleges that certain defendants were &#147;appointing&#148;
fiduciaries who failed to monitor the performance of the defendant-fiduciaries
they appointed. Further
 the Amended Complaint alleges
that all defendants are liable as co-fiduciaries for one another&#146;s alleged
breaches. Plaintiffs seek actual damages in the amount of any losses the RSP and
To-Ricos Plan attributable to the decline in the value of the common stock held
by the Plans
 to be allocated among the participants&#146; individual accounts as
benefits due in proportion to the accounts&#146; alleged diminution in value
 costs
and attorneys&#146; fees
 an order for equitable restitution and the imposition of
constructive trust
 and a declaration that each of the defendants have breached
their ERISA fiduciary duties to the RSP and To-Ricos Plan&#146;s participants.




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on May 3
 2010.
On August 29
 2012
 the Magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation to
deny the Defendants&#146; motion to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the
complaint included too many exhibits. Defendants filed objections with the
District Court
 and on October 29
 2012
 the District Court adopted the
Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge and entered an order denying Defendants&#146;
motion to dismiss. On November 11
 2012
 Plaintiffs filed a motion for class
certification. The motion is fully briefed and was argued to the Court on
February 28
 2013. The parties are awaiting a decision on the motion.

Tax Claims and Proceedings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The United States Department of Treasury
 Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) filed
an amended proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to which the IRS
asserted claims that total $74.7 million. We filed in the Bankruptcy Court (i)
an objection to the IRS&#146; amended proof of claim
 and (ii) a motion requesting
the Bankruptcy Court to determine our U.S. federal tax liability pursuant to
Sections 105 and 505 of Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code. The
objection and motion asserted that the Company had no liability for the
additional U.S. federal taxes that have been asserted for pre-petition periods
by the IRS. The IRS responded in opposition to our objection and motion. On July
8
 2010
 the Bankruptcy Court granted our unopposed motion requesting that the
Bankruptcy Court abstain from determining our federal tax liability. As a result
we have worked with the IRS through the normal processes and procedures that are
available to all taxpayers outside of bankruptcy including the United States Tax
Court (&#147;Tax Court&#148;) proceedings discussed below) to resolve the IRS&#146; amended
proof of claim. On December 13
 2012
 we entered into two Stipulation of Settled
Issues (&#147;Stipulation&#148; or &#147;Stipulations&#148;) with the IRS. The first Stipulation
relates to the Company&#146;s 2003
 2005
 and 2007 tax years and resolves all of the
material issues in the case. The second Stipulation relates to the Company as
the successor in interest to Gold Kist Inc. (&#147;Gold Kist&#148;) for the tax years
ended June 30
 2005 and September 30
 2005
 and resolves all substantive issues
in the case. These Stipulations account for approximately $29.3 million of the
amended proof of claim and should result in no additional tax due. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
connection with the amended proof of claim
 on May 26
 2010
 we filed a petition
in Tax Court in response to a Notice of Deficiency that was issued to the
Company as the successor in interest to Gold Kist. The Notice of Deficiency and
the Tax Court proceeding relate to a loss that Gold Kist claimed for its tax
year ended June 30
 2004. On December 11
 2013
 the Tax Court issued its opinion
in the Tax Court Case holding the loss that Gold Kist claimed for its tax year
ended June 30
 2004 is capital in nature. On January 10
 2014
 PPC filed both a
Motion for Reconsideration and a Motion for Full Tax Court review of both its
Motion for Reconsideration and any order issued in response to such motion. On
January 15
 2014
 the Tax Court issued an order requesting the IRS to respond to
PPC&#146;s Motion for Reconsideration on or before February 18
 2014. The Company
intends to vigorously pursue its appellate rights. This proceeding accounts for
approximately $45.4 million of the amended proof of claim. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
express no opinion as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the amount
or range of any possible loss to us related to the above Tax Court case related
to Gold Kist&#146;s tax year ended June 30
 2004. If adversely determined
 the
outcome could have a material effect on the Company&#146;s operating results and
financial position. 
Other Claims and Proceedings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims
 which arise in the
ordinary course of our business. In the opinion of management
 the amount of
ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our
financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows. 
Mine Safety Disclosures

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
None.

In December 2009
 we
      changed our fiscal year end from the Saturday nearest September 30 of each
      year to the last Sunday in December of each year. The change was effective
      for our 2010 fiscal year
 which began December 28
 2009 and ended December
      26
 2010 and resulted in an approximate three-month transition period
      which began September 27
 2009 and ended December 27
 2009
 which we
      sometimes refer to as the Transition Period. The reader should assume any
      reference we make to a particular year (for example
 2012) in this annual
      report applies to our fiscal year and not the calendar year.

Income tax expense in 2013
      resulted primarily from expense recorded on our year-to-date income offset
      by a decrease in valuation allowance as a result of year-to-date earnings.
      Income tax benefit in 2012 resulted primarily from a decrease in valuation
      allowance and a decrease in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. Income tax expense in 2011 resulted primarily from an
      increase in valuation allowance and an increase in reserves for
      unrecognized tax benefits. Income tax benefit in 2010 resulted primarily
      from the benefit on the deconsolidation for tax purposes of the Mexico
      operations and a decrease in valuation allowance. The deconsolidation for
      tax purposes of the Mexico operations was in response to changes in the
      Mexican tax laws that became effective January 1
 2010. The
      deconsolidation reduces the accrued taxes that had been previously
      recognized under the consolidated filing status as it eliminates
      recapturing certain taxes required under the new consolidation laws.
      Income tax benefit for the Transition Period resulted primarily from the
      release of valuation allowance because of new provisions that increased
      U.S. federal net operating loss carry backs net of tax expense for new
      Mexico tax legislation. Income tax expense for the thirteen weeks ended
      December 27
 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in valuation
      allowance. Income tax benefit in 2009 resulted primarily from a decrease
      in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. 
  
    
    

For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges
      earnings consist of income before income taxes plus fixed charges
      (excluding capitalized interest). Fixed charges consist of interest
      (including capitalized interest) on all indebtedness
 amortization of
      capitalized financing costs and that portion of rental expense that we
      believe to be representative of interest. Earnings were inadequate to
      cover fixed charges by $490.6 million

 and
      $176.5 million

&#147;EBITDA&#148; is defined as the sum of
      income (loss) from continuing operations plus interest
 taxes
      depreciation and amortization. &#147;Adjusted EBITDA&#148; is calculated by adding
      to EBITDA certain items of expense and deducting from EBITDA certain items
      of income that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating
      performance consisting of: (i) income (loss) attributable to
      noncontrolling interests in the period from 2009 through 2013 and the
      Transition Period
 (ii) restructuring charges in 2013
 2012
 2011
 2010
      and 2009
 (iii) reorganization items in 2010 and 2009 and (iv) losses on
      early extinguishment of debt in 2010. EBITDA is
      presented because it is used by us and we believe it is frequently used by
      securities analysts
 investors and other interested parties
 in addition
      to and not in lieu of results prepared in conformity with GAAP
 to compare
      the performance of companies. We believe investors would be interested in
      our Adjusted EBITDA because this is how our management analyzes EBITDA
      from continuing operations. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA
 in
      combination with our financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP
      provides investors with additional perspective regarding the impact of
      certain significant items on EBITDA and facilitates a more direct
      comparison of its performance with its competitors. EBITDA and Adjusted
      EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP. EBITDA
      and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be
      considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results
      as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of these measures are:
      
  
    
    

They do not reflect our cash
        expenditures
 future requirements for capital expenditures or

They do not reflect changes in
 or cash
        requirements for

They do not reflect the significant interest
        expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or

Although depreciation and amortization are
        non-cash charges
 the assets being depreciated and amortized will often
future
 and
        EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such

They are not adjusted for all non-cash
        income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash

EBITDA does not reflect the impact of

They do not reflect the impact of earnings
        or charges resulting from matters we consider to not be indicative of

They do not reflect limitations on or costs

        
  
    
    

In addition
 other companies in
      our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do
 limiting
      their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations
      EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to
      cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an

Management&#146;s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Description of the Company

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
are one of the largest chicken producers in the world with operations in the
U.S.
 Mexico and Puerto Rico. We are primarily engaged in the production
processing
 marketing and distribution of fresh
 frozen and value-added chicken
products to retailers
 distributors and foodservice operators. Our primary
product types are fresh chicken products
 prepared chicken products and export
chicken products. We sell our fresh chicken products to the foodservice and
retail markets. We sell our prepared food products to foodservice customers and
retail distributors. We also export products to customers in approximately 100
countries
 including Mexico. As a vertically integrated company
 we control
every phase of the production of our products. We operate feed mills
hatcheries
 processing plants and distribution centers in 12 U.S. states
 Puerto
Rico and Mexico. We operate in one reportable business segment
 as a producer
and seller of chicken products we either produce or purchase for resale. Our
fresh chicken products consist of refrigerated (nonfrozen) whole or cut-up
chicken
 either pre-marinated or non-marinated
 and prepackaged chicken in
various combinations of freshly refrigerated
 whole chickens and chicken parts.
Our prepared chicken products include portion-controlled breast fillets
tenderloins and strips
 delicatessen products
 salads
 formed nuggets and
patties and bone-in chicken parts. These products are sold either refrigerated
or frozen and may be fully cooked
 partially cooked or raw. In addition
 these
products are breaded or non-breaded and either pre-marinated or non-marinated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
have a broad geographic reach and we offer our diverse customer base a balanced
portfolio of fresh and prepared chicken products. We have consistently provided
our customers with high quality products and service with a focus on delivering
higher-value
 higher-quality products. As such
 we have become a valuable
partner to our customers and a recognized industry leader. Our sales efforts are
largely targeted towards the foodservice industry
 principally chain
restaurants
 food processors and broad-line distributors. In 2013
 we sold 7.2
billion pounds of dressed chicken and generated net sales of $8.4 billion. Our
U.S. operations
 including Puerto Rico
 accounted for 89.2% of our net sales in
2013. Our Mexico operations generated the remaining 10.8% of our net sales in
2013. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
operate on the basis of a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday falling
on or before December 31. The reader should assume any reference we make to a
particular year (for example
 2013) in this annual report applies to our fiscal
year and not the calendar year. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
reported net income attributable to Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Corporation of $549.6
million
 or $2.12 per diluted common share
 for 2013. These operating results
included gross profit of $845.4 million. During 2013
 we generated $878.5
million of cash from operations. At December 29
 2013
 we had cash and cash
equivalents totaling $508.2 million. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Market prices for corn decreased during the latter half of 2013 to a low of
$4.12 per bushel and soybean meal continued its volatility with a high of
$535.30 per ton and a low of $391.80 per ton during 2013. Market prices for feed
ingredients remain volatile. Consequently
 there can be no assurance that our
feed ingredient prices will not increase materially and that such increases
would not negatively impact our financial position
 results of operations and
cash flow. The following table compares the highest and lowest prices reached on
nearby futures for one bushel of corn and one ton of soybean meal during the
current year and previous two years:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
purchase derivative financial instruments
 specifically exchange-traded futures
and options
 in an attempt to mitigate price risk related to our anticipated
consumption of commodity inputs such as corn
 soybean meal
 sorghum
 wheat
soybean oil and natural gas. We will sometimes take a short position on a
derivative instrument to minimize the impact of a commodity's price volatility
on our operating results. We will also occasionally purchase derivative
financial instruments in an attempt to mitigate currency exchange rate exposure
related to the financial statements of our Mexico operations that are
denominated in Mexican pesos. We do not designate derivative financial
instruments that we purchase to mitigate commodity purchase exposures as cash
flow hedges; therefore
 we recognize changes in the fair value of these
derivative financial instruments immediately in earnings. We recognized $25.1
million
 $8.3 million and $63.8 million in net gains related to changes in the
fair value of derivative financial instruments during 2013
 2012 and 2011
respectively. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although changes in the market price paid for feed ingredients impact cash
outlays at the time we purchase the ingredients
 such changes do not immediately
impact cost of sales. The cost of feed ingredients is recognized in cost of
sales
 on a first-in-first-out basis
 at the same time that the sales of the
chickens that consume the feed grains are recognized. Thus
 there is a lag
between the time cash is paid for feed ingredients and the time the cost of such
feed ingredients is reported in cost of goods sold. For example
 corn delivered
to a feed mill and paid for one week might be used to manufacture feed the
following week. However
 the chickens that eat that feed might not be processed
and sold for another 42-63 days
 and only at that time will the costs of the
feed consumed by the chicken become included in cost of goods sold. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Commodities such as corn
 soybean meal
 sorghum
 wheat and soybean oil are
actively traded through various exchanges with future market prices quoted on a
daily basis. These quoted market prices
 although a good indicator of the
commodity's base price
 do not represent the final price for which we can
purchase these commodities. There are several components in addition to the
quoted market price
 such as freight
 storage and seller premiums
 that are
included in the final price that we pay for grain. Although changes in quoted
market prices may be a good indicator of the commodity&#146;s base price
 the
components mentioned above may have a larger impact on the total change in grain
costs recognized from period to period. The prices related to the other
components were especially high this year as we transitioned from a year of
record low grain stocks
 primarily caused by drought conditions
 to a year with
normal grain stocks. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Market prices for chicken products are currently at levels sufficient to offset
the costs of feed ingredients. However
 there can be no assurance that chicken
prices will not decrease due to such factors as competition from other proteins
and substitutions by consumers of non-protein foods because of uncertainty
surrounding the general economy and unemployment. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From time to time
 we incur costs to implement exit or disposal efforts for
specific operations. These exit or disposal plans focus on various aspects of
operations
 including closing and consolidating certain processing facilities
rationalizing headcount and aligning operations in the most strategic and
cost-efficient structure. During 2013
 we recognized total costs of $5.7
million
 which included asset impairment costs of $3.7 million and other costs
of $2.0 million
 related to exit or disposal efforts. During 2012
 we recognized
total costs of $8.7 million
 which included asset impairment costs of $2.8
million
 inventory valuation costs of $0.1 million
 employee-related costs of
$0.1 million and other costs of $5.7 million
 related to exit or disposal efforts. We expect to incur additional costs related to
ongoing exit or disposal efforts
 which we estimate will be approximately $3.0
million in 2014. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
continue to review and evaluate various restructuring and other alternatives to
streamline our operations
 improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Such
initiatives may include selling assets
 consolidating operations and functions
employee relocation and voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs.
Any such actions may require us to obtain the pre-approval of the lenders under
our credit facilities. In addition
 such actions will subject us to additional
short-term costs
 which may include asset impairment charges
 lease commitment
costs
 employee retention and severance costs and other costs. Certain of these
activities may have a disproportionate impact on our income relative to the cost
savings. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Trade authorities in Mexico

recent years
 completed an investigation of U.S. producers over dumping
complaints lodged by certain Mexican chicken processors. These Mexican chicken
processors alleged U.S. producers sold chicken legs and thighs on the Mexican

 the Mexican government issued final resolutions imposing duties
on our company and certain other U.S. chicken producers. Mexico will impose a
duty of approximately 25% on chicken legs and thighs exported by our company and
three other U.S. exporters and duties of approximately 127% on chicken legs and
thighs exported by all other U.S. companies from the U.S. to Mexico. However
the Mexican government has postponed the imposition of these duties until
conditions in Mexico&#146;s domestic chicken market resulting from the outbreak of
H7N3 avian influenza in the Mexican state of Jalisco have normalized. On

 2012
 we and certain other U.S. producers filed a request with the
NAFTA Secretariat for a panel review of Mexico&#146;s decision. Management does not
believe that these duties
 when imposed
 will materially impact our financial
position
 results of operations or cash flow. 
Business Segment and Geographic
Reporting 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
operate in one reportable business segment
 as a producer and seller of chicken
products we either produce or purchase for resale in the U.S.
 Puerto Rico and
Mexico. We conduct separate operations in the U.S.
 Puerto Rico and Mexico;
however
 for geographic reporting purposes
 we include Puerto Rico with our U.S.
operations. Corporate expenses are allocated to Mexico based upon various
apportionment methods for specific expenditures incurred related thereto with
the remaining amounts allocated to the U.S.

U.S. sales generated
      in 2013 increased $250.7 million
 or 3.5%
 from U.S. sales generated in
      2012
 despite a decrease in the number of weeks included in the fiscal
      year from 53 in 2012 to 52 in 2013
 primarily because of an increase in
      the net revenue per pound sold that was partially offset by a decrease in
      pounds sold. Increased net revenue per pound sold
 which resulted
      primarily from an increase in market prices due to continued healthy
      demand for chicken products in combination with constrained supply
      contributed $484.3 million
 or 6.7 percentage points
 to the revenue
      increase. A decrease in pounds sold partially offset the increase in
      revenue per pound sold by $233.6 million
 or 3.2 percentage points.
      Included in U.S. sales generated during 2013 and 2012 were sales to JBS
      USA
 LLC totaling $61.9 million and $206.7 million
  respectively.
  
    
    
Mexico sales generated in 2013 increased $39.0 million
 or 4.5%
 from Mexico sales generated in 2012
 despite a decrease in the number of weeks included in the respective fiscal years
 primarily because of the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and an increase in market prices that were partially offset by a decrease in unit sales volume. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation contributed $28.3 million
 or 3.2 percentage points
 to the revenue increase. An increase in market prices contributed $19.8 million
 or 2.3 percentage points to the revenue increase. A decrease in pounds sold partially offset the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and the increase in market prices by $9.1 million
 or 1.0 percentage points
 and resulted primarily from the lack of broiler eggs following the H7N3 influenza outbreak in Mexico in late 2012 and early 2013.

Cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2013 decreased $134.5 million
 or 1.9%
 from cost of sales incurred by our U.S. operations in 2012. Along with a decrease in the number of weeks included in the respective fiscal years
 the reduction in cost of sales resulted from (i) a $57.9 million decrease in co-pack labor and meat
 which resulted primarily from the decrease in sales volume
 (ii) a $24.1 million decrease in insurance costs resulting primarily from improved workers compensation loss performance
 (iii) a $14.6 million decrease in live production costs
 which were lower primarily because of a reduction in feed ingredient costs
 (iv) a $13.6 million increase in derivative gains
 (v) the August 2012 disposal of our commercial egg business
 which incurred cost of sales totaling $12.0 million in 2012
 (vi) a $10.1 million decrease in freight and storage costs
 (vii) a $9.7 million decrease in compensation and employee relations costs and (viii) a $5.2 million decrease in rental and lease costs. Other factors affecting U.S. cost of sales were immaterial.
  
    
    
Cost of sales incurred
      by the Mexico operations during 2013 increased $13.8 million
 or 1.8%
      from cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2012 despite
      the decrease in the number of weeks included in the respective fiscal
      years. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation contributed
      $24.3 million
 or 3.2 percentage points
 to the increase in cost of sales.
      Fertile egg purchases contributed $4.7 million
 or 0.6% percentage points
      and increased feed costs contributed $3.0 million
 or 0.4 percentage
      points
 to the increase in cost of sales. The impact of decreased sales
      volume
 which resulted primarily from the lack of broiler eggs following
      the H7N3 influenza outbreak in Mexico
 offset the increase in cost of
      sales by $10.0 million
 or 1.3 percentage points. Finally
 improved
      processing performance offset the increase in cost of sales by $8.8
      million
 or 1.1 percentage points. Other factors affecting Mexico cost of
      sales were immaterial.

SG&amp;A expenses
      incurred by the U.S. operations during 2013 increased $0.8 million
 or
      0.5%
 from SG&amp;A expenses incurred by the U.S. operations during 2012
      despite a decrease in the number of weeks included in the respective
      fiscal years from 53 in 2012 to 52 in 2013
 primarily because of a $15.0
      million increase in payroll and related benefits expenses resulting
      primarily from higher incentive compensation and pension costs. This
      increase in SG&amp;A expenses was partially offset by (i) an $8.2 million
      decrease in outside services and professional fees
 (ii) a $3.5 million
      decrease in brokerage expenses and (iii) a $2.0 million decrease in
      depreciation and amortization expenses. Other factors affecting U.S.
      SG&amp;A expenses were immaterial.
  
    
    
SG&amp;A expense
      incurred by the Mexico operations during 2013 increased $3.1 million
 or
      17.3%
 from SG&amp;A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during
      2012
 despite a decrease in the number of weeks included in the respective
      fiscal years
 primarily because of a $2.1 million fine assessed by a
      commission of the Mexican government that we are currently appealing. The
      unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation also contributed $0.6
      million
 or 3.6 percentage points
 to the increase in SG&amp;A expenses.
      Other factors affecting Mexico SG&amp;A expenses were
  immaterial.
  
    
    
Administrative
      restructuring charges incurred during 2013 decreased $2.7 million
 or
      33.0%
 from administrative restructuring charges incurred during 2012.
      During 2013
 we incurred administrative restructuring charges related to
      noncash impairment charges of $3.7 million and live operations
      rationalization totaling $2.0 million. During 2012
 we incurred
      administrative restructuring charges composed of (i) flock rationalization
      costs of $3.7 million related to our Dallas
 Texas plant closure
 (ii)
      impairment costs of $2.8 million and (iii) a loss resulting from the
      disposal of certain unused assets of $2.0
million.
Interest
expense
decreased 17.1% to $87.0 million in 2013 from $104.9 million in 2012 primarily
because of decreased average borrowings of $990.5 million in 2013 compared to
$1
242.2 million in 2012 partially offset by an increase in the weighted average
interest rate to 7.10% in 2013 from 7.00% in 2012. As a percent of net sales
interest expense in 2013 and 2012 was 1.0% and 1.3%
respectively.
The Company's consolidated income tax expense in 2013 was
$24.2 million
 compared to income tax benefit of $21.0 million in 2012. The
income tax expense in 2013 resulted primarily from an increase in income and a
decrease in the valuation allowance. The net change in the total valuation
allowance for 2013 was a decrease of $178.0 million
 resulting primarily from
the utilization of almost all of our domestic net operating losses. Due to this
decrease
 we expect a higher effective tax rate in the future. As of December
29
 2013
 our valuation allowance is $10.4 million
 of which $1.9 million
relates to capital loss carry forwards and $8.5 million relates to Mexico net
operating losses.



2012 Compared to
2011
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Net sales for 2012
increased $585.7 million

U.S. sales generated
      in 2012 increased $470.8 million
 or 6.9%
 from U.S. sales generated in
      2011
 primarily because of an increase in the net revenue per pound sold
      partially offset by a decrease in pounds sold. Increased net revenue per
      pound sold
 which resulted primarily from an increase in market prices
      contributed $499.6 million
 or 7.4 percentage points
 to the revenue
      increase. The decrease in pounds sold
 which resulted in part from the
      fourth quarter 2011 disposals of our distribution and pork businesses
      partially offset the increase in revenue per pound sold by $28.8 million
      or 0.4 percentage points. The disposed distribution and pork businesses
      generated net sales of $332.4 million during 2011. Included in U.S. sales
      generated during 2012 and 2011 were sales to JBS USA
 LLC totaling $206.7
      million and $117.9 million
 respectively.
  
    
    
Mexico sales generated
      in 2012 increased $114.9 million
 or 15.2%
 from Mexico sales generated in
      2011. An increase in unit sales volume
 which resulted primarily from
      higher customer demand
 contributed $60.0 million
 or 7.9 percentage
      points
 to the revenue increase. The increase in sales price
 due to
      reduced supply resulting from production cuts
 contributed $54.9 million
      or 7.3 percentage points.
 Gross profit increased by $577.4 million
 or 407.9%
 in 2012
from a gross loss of $141.5 million incurred in 2011 to a gross profit of $435.8
million generated in 2012. The following tables provide gross loss

Cost of sales incurred
      by the U.S. operations during 2012 decreased $20.1 million
 or 0.3%
 from
      cost of sales incurred by the U.S. operations during 2011. The disposal of
      the distribution and pork businesses contributed $295.2 million
 or 4.3
      percentage points
 to the decrease in cost of sales. The closing of our
      Dallas
 Texas plant contributed $62.0 million
 or 0.9 percentage points
      to the decrease in cost of sales. Decreased depreciation contributed $59.2
      million
 or 0.9 percentage points
 to the decrease in cost of sales. The
      disposal of the commercial egg business contributed $12.0 million
 or 0.2
      percentage points
 to the decrease in cost of sales. Decreased fleet
      expenses contributed $11.0 million
 or 0.2 percentage points
 to the
      decrease in cost of sales. The decrease in cost of sales was partially
      offset by higher live production costs
 which increased primarily because
      of higher feed ingredient costs
 derivative net gain and packaging and
      ingredients costs. Feed ingredients costs contributed $365.0 million
 or
      5.3 percentage points
 to the increase in cost of sales. Net gains
      recognized on both settled and outstanding derivative instruments
      contributed $54.0 million
 or 0.8 percentage points
 to the increase in
      cost of sales. Packaging and ingredients costs contributed $4.0 million
      or 0.1 percentage points
 to the increase in cost of sales. Other factors
      affecting cost of sales were immaterial.




  
    
    
Cost of sales incurred
      by the Mexico operations during 2012 increased $30.4 million
 or 4.1%
      from cost of sales incurred by the Mexico operations during 2011.
      Increased feed costs contributed $108.7 million
 or 14.7 percentage points
      and increased sales volume contributed $48.3 million
 or 6.5 percentage
      points
 to the increase in cost of sales. Decreased overhead costs and
      foreign currency translation partially offset the increase by $81.6
      million and $44.9 million
 respectively. Other factors affecting cost of
      sales were immaterial.
  
    
    
Operational
      restructuring charges incurred by the U.S. operations during 2012
      decreased $2.0 million
 or 100.0%
 from operational restructuring charges
      incurred by the U.S. operations during 2011. Operational restructuring
      charges for 2011 of $2.0 million represented impairment expense recognized
      to reduce the carrying amount of certain assets located at our commercial
      egg operations in Texas to fair value.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Operating
income increased $623.9 million
 or 167.0%
 from an operating loss of $373.6
million incurred for 2011 to operating income of $250.3 million incurred for
2012. The following tables provide operating income information:

 or
      14.4%
 from SG&amp;A expenses incurred by the U.S. operations during 2011
      primarily because of (i) a decrease in outside services and professional
      fees of $7.1 million
 (ii) a decrease in transactional tax expenses of
      $3.1 million
 (iii) a decrease in brokerage expenses of $3.0 million
 (iv)
      a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $2.4 million
 (v) a
      decrease in marketing and development expenses of $2.2 million and (vi) a
      decrease in payroll and related benefit expenses $1.5 million. Other
      factors affecting SG&amp;A expense were immaterial.
  
    
    
SG&amp;A expense
      incurred by the Mexico operations during 2012 decreased $1.4 million
 or
      7.1%
 from SG&amp;A expense incurred by the Mexico operations during 2011.
      Foreign exchange translation accounted for a decrease of $1.1 million of
      the decrease in SG&amp;A expense. Other factors affecting SG&amp;A expense
      were immaterial.
  
    
    
Administrative
      restructuring charges incurred during 2012 decreased $18.5 million
 or
      68.6%
 from administrative restructuring charges incurred during 2011.
      During 2012
 we incurred administrative restructuring charges composed of
      (i) flock rationalization costs of $3.7 million related to our Dallas
      Texas plant closure
 (ii) impairment costs of $2.8 million and (iii) a
      loss resulting from the disposal of certain unused assets of $2.0 million.
      During 2011
 the Company incurred administrative restructuring charges
      composed of (i) impairment charges of $20.9 million
 (ii) flock
      rationalization costs of $5.2 million related to the closure of the
      Dallas
 Texas plant and (iii) severance costs of $0.7
  million.
Interest
expense
decreased 5.9% to $104.9 million in 2012 from $111.5 million in 2011 primarily
because of decreased average borrowings of $1
242.2 million in 2012 compared to
$1
483.0 million in 2011 partially offset by and increase in the weighted
average interest rate increased to 7.0% in 2012 from 6.7% in 2011. As a percent
of net sales
 interest expense in 2012 and 2011
 was 1.3% and 1.5%
respectively. 



Income
taxes
benefit in 2012 was $21.0 million
 compared to income tax expense of $8.6
million in 2011. The income tax benefit in 2012 resulted primarily from a
decrease in valuation allowance and a decrease in reserves for unrecognized tax
benefits. The income tax expense in 2011 resulted primarily from an increase in
valuation allowance and an increase in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits.

Actual borrowings by
      the Company under the U.S. Credit Facility (as defined below) are subject
      to a borrowing base
 which is a formula based on certain eligible
      inventory and eligible receivables. The borrowing base in effect on
      December 29
 2013 was $695.4 million. Availability under the U.S. Credit
      Facility is also reduced by the Company&#146;s outstanding standby letters of
      credit. Standby letters of credit outstanding at December 29
 2013 totaled
      $29.6 million.
  
    
    
Under the Mexico
      Credit Facility (as defined below)
 if (i) any default or event of default
      has occurred and is continuing or (ii) the quotient of the borrowing base
      divided by the outstanding loans and letters of credit (the &#147;Collateral
      Coverage Ratio&#148;) under the Mexico Credit Facility is less than 1.25 to
      1.00
 the loans and letters of credit under the Mexico Credit Facility
      will be subject to
 and cannot exceed
 a borrowing base. The borrowing
      base is a formula based on accounts receivable
 inventory
 prepaid assets
      net cash under the control of the administrative agent and up to 150.0
      million Mexican pesos of fixed assets of the loan parties. The borrowing
      base formula will be reduced by trade payables of the loan parties. If the
      Collateral Coverage Ratio falls below 1.25 to 1.00
 the borrowing base
      requirement would terminate upon the earlier of (i) the Collateral
      Coverage Ratio exceeding 1.25 to 1.00 as of the latest measurement period
      for 60 consecutive days or (ii) the borrowing availability under the
      Mexico Credit Facility being equal to or greater than the greater of 20%
      of the revolving commitments under the Mexico Credit Facility and 100.0
      million Mexican pesos for a period of 60 consecutive
  days.
Debt Obligations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At
December 29
 2013
 we had an aggregate principal balance of $500.0 million of
7 &#8542;% senior notes due 2018 (the
&#147;2018 Notes&#148;) outstanding that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
The 2018 Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by
one of our subsidiaries. Interest is payable on December 15 and June 15 of each
year
 commencing on June 15
 2011. The indenture governing the 2018 Notes
contains various covenants that may adversely affect our ability
 among other
things
 to incur additional indebtedness
 incur liens
 pay dividends or make
certain restricted payments
 consummate certain asset sales
 enter into certain
transactions with JBS USA and our other affiliates
 merge
 consolidate and/or
sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally
 we have
an aggregate principal balance of $3.6 million of 7 &#8541;% senior
unsecured notes and 8 &#8540;% senior subordinated unsecured notes
outstanding at December 29
 2013.

JBS Subordinated Loan
. On June 23
 2011
 we entered into
a Subordinated Loan Agreement with JBS USA (the &#147;Subordinated Loan Agreement&#148;).
Pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Loan Agreement
 we agreed to reimburse
JBS USA up to $56.5 million for draws upon any letters of credit issued for JBS
USA's account that support certain obligations of our company or its
subsidiaries. JBS USA agreed to arrange for letters of credit to be issued on
its account in the amount of $56.5 million to an insurance company serving us in
order to allow that insurance company to return cash it held as collateral
against potential workers compensation
 auto and general liability claims. In
return for providing this letter of credit
 we agreed to reimburse JBS USA for
the letter of credit cost we would otherwise incur under our U.S. Credit
Facility (as defined below). The total amount we paid in 2013
 2012 and 2011 to
reimburse JBS USA
 was $2.2 million
 $2.2 million and $0.4 million
respectively. As of December 29
 2013
 we have accrued an obligation of $0.1
million to reimburse JBS USA for letter of credit costs incurred on our behalf.
There remains no other commitment to make advances by JBS USA under the
Subordinated Loan Agreement. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. We and certain of
our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the &#147;U.S. Credit Facility&#148;)
with CoBank
 ACB
 as administrative agent and collateral agent
 and other
lenders party thereto
 which was amended and restated on August 7
 2013. The
U.S. Credit Facility currently provides for a $700.0 million revolving credit
facility
 a Term B facility of approximately $410.1 million and a delayed draw
term loan commitment of up to $400 million (the &#147;Delayed Draw
Term Loans&#148;). We can draw upon the Delayed
Draw Term Loan commitment
 in one or more advances
 between May 1
 2014 and
December 28
 2014. The U.S. Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature
that allows us
 at any time
 to increase the aggregate revolving loan commitment
by up to an additional $250.0 million and to increase the aggregate Delayed Draw
Term Loan commitment by up to an additional $500.0 million
 in each case subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions
 including obtaining the lenders&#146;
agreement to participate in the increase and an aggregate limit on all
commitments under the U.S. Credit Facility of $1.85 billion. The U.S. Credit
Facility also provides for a $100 million sub-limit for swingline loans and a
$200 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Term B Loans mature on
December 28
 2014 with all principal and unpaid interest due at maturity. The
revolving loan commitment under the U.S. Credit Facility matures on August 7
2018. Any Delayed Draw Term Loans would be payable in quarterly installments
beginning in fiscal year 2015 equal to 1.875% of the principal outstanding as of
December 28
 2014
 with all remaining principal and interest due at maturity on
August 7
 2018.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 2009
 we paid loan costs totaling $50.0 million related
to the U.S. Credit Facility that we recognized as an asset on our balance sheet.
On August 7
 2013
 we paid loan costs totaling $5.0 million related to the
amendment and restatement to the U.S. Credit Facility that we recognized as an
asset on our balance sheet. We amortize these capitalized costs to interest
expense over the life of the U.S. Credit Facility. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 a portion of our cash flow
must be used to repay outstanding principal amounts under the Term B loans. With
respect to 2013
 we paid $204.9 million of our cash flow toward the outstanding
principal under the Term B-1 loans on December 30
 2013
 and expect to pay
approximately $205.2 million of our cash flow toward the outstanding principal
under the Term B-2 loans on April 28
 2014. Following the April 28
 2014
payment
 we will have no outstanding principal under the Term B loans. The U.S.
Credit Facility also requires us to use the proceeds we receive from certain
asset sales and specified debt or equity issuances and upon the occurrence of
other events to repay outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Credit Facility. On
December 29
 2013
 a principal amount of $410.1 million under the Term B loans
commitment was outstanding.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

of the U.S. Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base
 which is a formula
based on certain eligible inventory
 eligible receivables and restricted cash
under the control of CoBank
 ACB. As of December 29
 2013
 the applicable
borrowing base was $695.4 million
 the amount available for borrowing under the
revolving loan commitment was $665.8 million. We had letters of credit of $29.6
million and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan commitment as of
December 29
 2013. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

covenants that may adversely affect our ability to
 among other things
 incur
additional indebtedness
 incur liens
 pay dividends or make certain restricted
payments
 consummate certain assets sales
 enter into certain transactions with
JBS USA and our other affiliates
 merge
 consolidate and/or sell or dispose of
all or substantially all of our assets. The U.S. Credit Facility requires us to
comply with a minimum level of tangible net worth covenant. We are currently in
compliance with this financial covenant. All other financial covenants were
eliminated in connection with the August 7
 2013 amendment and restatement to
the U.S. Credit Facility. The U.S. Credit Facility also provides that we may not
incur capital expenditures in excess of $350.0 million in any fiscal year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority
lien on (i) the accounts receivable and inventories our company and our
non-Mexico subsidiaries
 (ii) 65% of the equity interests in our direct foreign
subsidiaries and 100% of the equity interests in our other subsidiaries
 (iii)
substantially all of the personal property and intangibles of the borrowers and
guarantors under the U.S. Credit Facility and (iv) substantially all of the real
estate and fixed assets of our company and the guarantor subsidiaries under the
U.S. Credit Facility. 
Mexico Credit Facility.
On October 19
 2011
 Av&#237;cola Pilgrim&#146;s Pride
de M&#233;xico
 S.A. de C.V. (&#147;Avicola&#148;)
 Pilgrim&#146;s Pride S. de R.L. de C.V. and
certain other Mexican subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated credit
agreement (the &#147;Mexico Credit Facility&#148;) with ING Bank (M&#233;xico)
 S.A.
Instituci&#243;n de Banca M&#250;ltiple
 ING Grupo Financiero
 as lender and ING Capital
LLC
 as administrative agent. The Mexico Credit Facility has a final maturity
date of September 25
 2014. The Mexico Credit Facility is secured by
substantially all of the assets of our Mexico subsidiaries. As of December 29
2013
 the U.S. dollar-equivalent of the loan commitment under the Mexico Credit
Facility was $42.7 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the
Mexico Credit Facility at December 29
 2013. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

amount not to exceed in the aggregate $250.0 million Mexican pesos during the
term of the Mexico Credit Facility if certain conditions are satisfied
including a condition that availability is at least 100% of the revolving loan
commitment under the Mexico Credit Facility
 less any letter of credit liability
under the Mexico Credit Facility. However
 we deem our earnings from Mexico as
of December 29
 2013 to be permanently reinvested. As such
 U.S. deferred income
taxes have not been provided on these earnings. If such earnings were not
considered indefinitely reinvested
 certain deferred foreign and U.S. income
taxes would be provided. 




Substantially
all of our domestic inventories and domestic fixed assets are pledged as
collateral to secure the obligations under the U.S. Credit Facility. The Mexico
Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company's
Mexico subsidiaries. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 some of
which contain residual value guarantees for the market value of assets at the
end of the term of the lease. The terms of the lease maturities range from one
to ten years. We estimate the maximum potential amount of the residual value
guarantees is approximately $2.6 million; however
 the actual amount would be
offset by any recoverable amount based on the fair market value of the
underlying leased assets. No liability has been recorded related to this
contingency as the likelihood of payments under these guarantees is not
considered to be probable
 and the fair value of the guarantees is immaterial.
We historically have not experienced significant payments under similar residual
guarantees. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks.
Among other considerations
 we have not recorded a liability for any of these
indemnities as
 based upon the likelihood of payment
 the fair value of such
indemnities would not have a material impact on our financial condition
 results
of operations and cash flows
Capital Expenditures

We anticipate spending
between $110.0 million and $150.0 million on the acquisition of property
 plant
and equipment in 2014. Capital expenditures will primarily be incurred to
improve efficiencies and reduce costs. We expect to fund these capital
expenditures with cash flow from operations and proceeds from the revolving
lines of credit under our various debt facilities.
Indefinite Reinvestment of Mexico
Subsidiaries' Undistributed Earnings 
We have determined that the
undistributed earnings of our Mexico subsidiaries will be indefinitely
reinvested and not distributed to the U.S. The undistributed earnings of our
Mexico subsidiaries totaled $286.3 million at December 29
2013.
Contractual Obligations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 2013
 we had other
commitments and contractual obligations that obligate us to make specified
payments in the future. The following table summarizes the total amounts due as
of December 29
 2013
 under all debt agreements
 commitments and other
contractual obligations. The table indicates the years in which payments are due
under the contractual obligations.

 2013 was $17.1 million. We
      did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table above as
      reasonable estimates cannot be made at this time of the amounts or timing
      of future cash outflows. The table above does not include estimated
      funding of our unfunded pension and other postretirement benefits
      obligations totaling approximately $63.2 million at December 29
 2013 as
      discussed in &#147;Note 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits&#148; to the

Long-term debt
      includes an unaccreted discount of $2.2 million and excludes $29.6 million
      in letters of credit outstanding related to normal business transactions.
      Pursuant to the U.S. Credit Facility
 subsequent to the end of each fiscal
      year
 a portion of our cash flow must be used to repay outstanding
      principal amounts under the Term B loans. With respect to 2013
 we paid
      $204.9 million of our cash flow toward the outstanding principal under the
      Term B-1 loans on December 30
 2013
 and expect to pay approximately
      $205.2 million of our cash flow toward the outstanding principal under the
      Term B-2 loans on April 28
 2014. After giving effect to these payments
      no Term B loans will remain outstanding under the U.S. Credit
      Facility.

Historical Flow of Funds

Fiscal Year 2013

Cash provided
by operating activities was $878.5 million for 2013 and cash provided by
operating activities was $199.6 million for 2012. The increase in cash flows
provided by operating activities was primarily from net income of $549.7 million
for 2013 as compared to net income of $174.0 million for 2012 and changes in
working capital (excluding the impacts as a result of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates). 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 which we define as current assets less
current liabilities
 increased $33.0 million to a surplus of $845.6 million and
a current ratio of 1.78 at December 29
 2013 compared to a surplus of $812.5
million and a current ratio of 2.11 at December 30
 2012. The increase in
working capital was caused by the generation of cash from operations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 including accounts receivable from
JBS USA
 decreased $7.3 million
 or 1.9%
 to $379.1 million at December 29
 2013
from $386.4 million at December 30
 2012. The change in trade accounts and other
receivables resulted primarily from improved collections. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 or 14.9%
 to $808.8 million at
December 29
 2013 from $950.3 million at December 30
 2012. The change in
inventories was primarily due to decreased costs for feed grains and their
impact on the value of our live chicken inventories. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 or
10.4%
 to $61.8 million at December 29
 2013 from $56.0 million at December 30
2012. This change resulted primarily from a $5.2 million increase in open
derivative positions and margin cash on deposit with our derivatives traders.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 including accounts payable to JBS
USA
 increased $48.3 million
 or 7.9%
 to $657.6 million at December 29
 2013
from $609.3 million at December 30
 2012. This change resulted primarily from
the timing of payments disbursed to vendors around December 29
 2013.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2013 and 2012
 respectively. We incurred capital expenditures of $116.2 million
and $90.3 million for 2013 and 2012
 respectively. In both 2013 and 2012
capital expenditures were primarily incurred for the routine replacement of
equipment and to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Cash was used to
purchase investment securities totaling $96.9 million and $0.2 million in 2013
and 2012
 respectively. Capital expenditures for 2013 could not exceed $350
million under the terms of the U.S. Credit Facility. Cash proceeds generated
from property disposals in 2013 and 2012 totaled $31.3 million and $29.4
million
 respectively. Cash proceeds generated in 2012 from the sale or maturity
of investment securities totaled $0.7 million.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

provided by financing activities was $111.0 million in 2012. Cash proceeds in
2013 and 2012 from long-term debt were $505.6 million and $851.4 million
respectively. Cash was used to repay long-term debt totaling $758.6 million and
$1
110.7 million in 2013 and 2012
 respectively. Cash proceeds in 2013 resulting
from a tax benefit related to share-based compensation totaled $7.7 million.
Cash was used to pay capitalized loan costs totaling $5.0 million in 2013. Cash
proceeds generated in 2012 from the sale of common stock totaled $198.3 million.
Cash was used in 2012 to repay a $50.0 million note payable issued to JBS USA
under the Subordinated Loan Agreement.
Fiscal Year 2012

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

cash used in operating activities was $129.0 million for 2011. The increase in
cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily from net income of
$174.0 million for 2012 as compared to a net loss of $495.7 million for 2011 and
changes in working capital (excluding the impacts as a result of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 which we define as current assets less
current liabilities
 increased $65.5 million to a surplus of $812.5 million and
a current ratio of 2.11 at December 30
 2012 compared to a surplus of $747.0
million and a current ratio of 2.04 at December 25
 2011. The increase in
working capital was caused by the generation of cash from operations.



Trade accounts
and other receivables
 including accounts receivable from JBS USA
 increased
$16.0 million
 or 4.3%
 to $379.1 million at December 30
 2012 from $370.4
million at December 25
 2011. The change in trade accounts and other receivables
resulted primarily from increased sales prices.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 or 8.1%
 to $950.3 million at
December 30
 2012 from $879.1 million at December 25
 2011. The change in
inventories was primarily due to increased costs for live chicken products and
feed
 eggs and other inventory items.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 or
7.1%
 to $56.0 million at December 30
 2012 from $52.3 million at December 25
2011. This change resulted primarily from a $9.8 million increase in value-added
tax receivables and an increase of $12.0 million in prepaid insurance. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease of $14.2 million in prepaid grain
purchases and a decrease of $4.3 million in open derivative
positions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 including accounts payable to JBS USA
 decreased $14.7
million
 or 4.3%
 to $325.8 million at December 30
 2012 from $340.5 million at
December 25
 2011. This change resulted from the timing of payments disbursed to
vendors at December 25
 2011. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 or 0.6%
 to $283.5 million at
December 30
 2012 from $281.8 million at December 25
 2011. This change resulted
primarily from a $5.3 million increase in compensation
 benefits and other
employee-related accruals and a $4.5 million increase in accrued property taxes.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.9 million in market
development fund accruals
 a $2.3 million decrease in accrued interest
 a $1.1
million decrease in brokerage accrued expenses and a $1.0 million decrease in
outstanding derivative liabilities. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2012 and 2011
 respectively. We incurred capital expenditures of $90.3 million
and $136.0 million for 2012 and 2011
 respectively. In 2012
 capital
expenditures were primarily incurred for the routine replacement of equipment
and to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. In 2011
 capital expenditures were
primarily incurred for the reopening of the Douglas
 Georgia facility and for
the routine replacement of equipment and to improve efficiencies and reduce
costs. Capital expenditures for 2012 could not exceed $175 million under the
terms of the U.S. Credit Facility. Cash was used to purchase investment
securities totaling $0.2 million and $4.6 million in 2012 and 2011
respectively. Cash proceeds in 2012 and 2011 from the sale or maturity of
investment securities were $0.7 million and $15.9 million
 respectively. Cash
proceeds from property disposals in 2012 and 2011 were $29.4 million and $29.0
million
 respectively. Cash proceeds from business dispositions in 2011 totaled
$37.5 million.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

provided by financing activities was $126.9 million in 2011. Cash was used in
2012 to repay a $50.0 million note payable issued to JBS USA under the
Subordinated Loan Agreement. Cash proceeds of $50.0 million were received in
2011 from JBS USA in exchange for a note payable issued under the Subordinated
Loan Agreement. Cash proceeds in 2012 and 2011 from long-term debt were $851.4
million and $965.7 million
 respectively. Cash was used to repay long-term debt
totaling $1
110.7 million and $881.8 million in 2012 and 2011
 respectively.
Cash proceeds in 2012 from the sale of common stock were $198.3 million. Cash
was used to pay capitalized loan costs totaling $4.4 million in 2011. Cash used
to purchase the remaining interest in a subsidiary we did not already own
totaled $2.5 million in 2011. Cash was used for other financing activities
totaling $0.1 million in 2011.
Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. Our discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
financial statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues and
expenses. On an ongoing basis
 we evaluate our estimates
 including those
related to revenue recognition
 customer programs and incentives
 allowance for
doubtful accounts
 inventories
 income taxes and product recall accounting. We
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial
statements. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 We recognize
revenue when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) price is fixed or determinable
 (iii)
collectability is reasonably assured and (iv) delivery has occurred. Delivery
occurs in the period in which the customer takes title and assumes the risks and
the products specified in
the customer's purchase order or sales agreement. Revenue is recorded net of
estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements
 promotions
and other volume-based incentives. Revisions to these estimates are charged back
to net sales in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision
become known.



 Live chicken inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeder hens at the lower of cost
less accumulated amortization
 or market. The costs associated with breeder hens
are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over their productive
lives using the unit-of-production method. Finished poultry products
 feed
 eggs
and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average) or market. We
record valuations and adjustments for our inventory and for estimated
obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the
estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting inventory
obsolescence
 including significantly aged products
 discontinued product lines
or damaged or obsolete products. We allocate meat costs between our various
finished chicken products based on a by-product costing technique that reduces
the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for
certain byproduct parts. This primarily includes leg quarters
 wings
 tenders
and offal
 which are carried in inventory at the estimated recovery amounts
with the remaining amount being reflected as our breast meat cost. Generally
the Company performs an evaluation of whether any lower of cost or market
adjustments are required at the country level based on a number of factors
including: (i) pools of related inventory
 (ii) product continuation or
discontinuation
 (iii) estimated market selling prices and (iv) expected
distribution channels. If actual market conditions or other factors are less
favorable than those projected by management
 additional inventory adjustments
may be required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Property
 Plant and Equipment.
The Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets held for use when
events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than
the carrying amount of those assets. The impairment charge is determined based
upon the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair
market value. In making these determinations
 the Company utilizes certain
assumptions
 including
 but not limited to: (i) future cash flows estimated to
be generated by these assets
 which are based on additional assumptions such as
asset utilization
 remaining length of service and estimated salvage values
(ii) estimated fair market value of the assets
 and (iii) determinations with
respect to the lowest level of cash flows relevant to the respective impairment
test
 generally groupings of related operational facilities. Given the
interdependency of the Company&#146;s individual facilities during the production
process
 which operate as a vertically integrated network
 and the fact that the
Company does not price the transfers of inventory between its vertically
integrated facilities at market prices
 it evaluates impairment of assets held
for use at the country level (i.e.
 the U.S. and Mexico) within each segment.
Management believes this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for its
assets that are held for use in production activities. At the present time
 the
Company&#146;s forecasts indicate that it can recover the carrying value of its
assets held for use based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the
operations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

when the carrying amount of those assets exceeds their fair value less
appropriate selling costs. Fair value is based on amounts documented in sales
contracts or letters of intent accepted by the Company
 amounts included in
counteroffers initiated by the Company
 or
 in the absence of current contract
negotiations
 amounts determined using a sales comparison approach for real
property and amounts determined using a cost approach for personal property.
Under the sales comparison approach
 sales and asking prices of reasonably
comparable properties are considered to develop a range of unit prices within
which the current real estate market is operating. Under the cost approach
 a
current cost to replace the asset new is calculated and then the estimated
replacement cost is reduced to reflect the applicable decline in value resulting
from physical deterioration
 functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence.
Appropriate selling costs includes reasonable broker's commissions
 costs to
produce title documents
 filing fees
 legal expenses and the like. We estimate
appropriate closing costs as 4% to 6% of asset fair value. This range of rates
is considered reasonable for our assets held for sale based on historical
experience. The Company recognized impairment charges related to assets held for
sale of $4.0 million and $2.8 million during 2013 and 2012
 respectively.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The Company is subject to lawsuits
 investigations and other claims
related to employment
 environmental
 product
 and other matters. The Company is
required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes
 as well
as potential ranges of probable losses
 to these matters. The Company estimates
the amount of reserves required for these contingencies when losses are
determined to be probable and after considerable analysis of each individual
issue. The Company expenses legal costs related to such loss contingencies as
they are incurred. With respect to our environmental remediation obligations
the accrual for environmental remediation liabilities is measured on an
undiscounted basis. These reserves may change in the future due to changes in
the Company&#146;s assumptions
 the effectiveness of strategies
 or other factors
beyond the Company&#146;s control.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. Insurance
expense for casualty claims and employee-related health care benefits are
estimated using historical and current experience and actuarial estimates.
Stop-loss coverage is maintained with third-party insurers to limit the
Company&#146;s total exposure. Certain categories of claim liabilities are
actuarially determined. The assumption used to arrive at periodic expenses is reviewed
regularly by management. However
 actual expenses could differ from these
estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized.




Income
 Starting in 2011
 the Company follows
the provisions of ASC 740-10-30-27 in the Expenses-Income Taxes topic with
regards to members of a group that file a consolidated tax return but issue
separate financial statements. The Company files its own U.S. federal tax
return
 but is included in certain state consolidated returns with JBS USA. The
income tax expense of the Company is computed using the separate return method.
The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability
approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach
 deferred income
taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the book and
tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities
 net operating losses and tax
credit carry forwards. The amount of deferred tax on these temporary differences
is determined using the tax rates expected to apply to the period when the asset
is realized or the liability is settled
 as applicable
 based on the tax rates
and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet
date. The Company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to income
tax positions as a part of the income tax provision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and
establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income
 potential
for carry back of tax losses
 projected future taxable income
 applicable tax
strategies
 and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary
differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not
that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Valuation
allowances have been established primarily for net operating loss carry
forwards. See &#147;Note 11. Income Taxes&#148; to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The Company deems its earnings from Mexico as of December 29
2013 to be permanently reinvested. As such
 U.S. deferred income taxes have not
been provided on these earnings. If such earnings were not considered
indefinitely reinvested
 certain deferred foreign and U.S. income taxes would be
provided. For activity after 2008
 the Company did not permanently reinvest its
earnings in Puerto Rico. Therefore
 net earnings generated in Puerto Rico have
U.S. taxes provided as if the earnings were distributed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The Company follows the provisions under ASC 740-10-25 that
provides a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial
statement recognition of a tax benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not
 based
on the technical merits
 that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax
benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured
using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has
greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit
is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances
evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date. See
&#147;Note 11. Income Taxes&#148; to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. The Company&#146;s pension and other postretirement benefit costs and
obligations are dependent on the various actuarial assumptions used in
calculating such amounts. These assumptions relate to discount rates
 salary
growth
 long-term return on plan assets and other factors. The Company bases the
discount rate assumptions on current investment yields on high-quality corporate
long-term bonds. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual
experience and future or near-term outlook. Long-term return on plan assets is
determined based on historical portfolio results and management&#146;s expectation of
the future economic environment. Actual results that differ from our assumptions
are accumulated and
 if in excess of the lesser of 10% of the projected benefit
obligation or the fair market value of plan assets
 amortized over either (i)
the estimated average future service period of active plan participants if the
plan is active or (ii) the estimated average future life expectancy of all plan
participants if the plan is frozen.



Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
Market Risk-Sensitive Instruments
and Positions 
The risk
inherent in our market risk-sensitive instruments and positions is primarily the
potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of feed ingredients
foreign currency exchange rates
 interest rates and the credit quality of
available-for-sale securities as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses
presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on
overall economic activity
 nor do they consider additional actions our
management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may
differ. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 We purchase
certain commodities
 primarily corn
 soybean meal and sorghum
 for use as
ingredients in the feed we either sell commercially or consume in our live
operations. As a result
 our earnings are affected by changes in the price and
availability of such feed ingredients. In the past
 we have from time to time
attempted to minimize our exposure to the changing price and availability of
such feed ingredients using various techniques
 including
 but not limited to
(i) executing purchase agreements with suppliers for future physical delivery of
feed ingredients at established prices and (ii) purchasing or selling derivative
financial instruments such as futures and options.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

weighted-average cost of our primary feed ingredients as of December 29
 2013.
However
 fluctuations greater than 10% could occur. Based on our feed
consumption during 2013
 such an increase would have resulted in an increase to
cost of sales of approximately $336.5 million
 excluding the impact of any feed
ingredients derivative financial instruments in that period. A 10% change in
ending feed ingredients inventories at December 29
 2013 would be $10.3 million
excluding any potential impact on the production costs of our chicken
inventories. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 specifically
exchange-traded futures and options
 in an attempt to mitigate price risk
related to its anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for the next 12
months. A 10% increase in corn
 soybean meal
 and natural gas prices on December
29
 2013 would have resulted in an increase of approximately $0.8 million in the
fair value of our net commodity derivative asset position as of that date.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Our earnings are
also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have
on our variable-rate debt instruments. We had variable-rate debt instruments
representing approximately 22.5% of our total debt at December 29
 2013. Holding
other variables constant
 including levels of indebtedness
 an increase in
interest rates of 25 basis points would have increased our interest expense by
$0.5 million for 2013. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of
the hypothetical interest rates on our variable-rate debt at December 29
2013.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 10%.
Using a discounted cash flow analysis
 a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest
rates would have increased the fair value of our fixed rate debt by
approximately $4.0 million as of December 29
 2013.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Our earnings
are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the Mexican peso
net monetary position of our Mexican subsidiaries. We manage this exposure
primarily by attempting to minimize our Mexican peso net monetary position. We
are also exposed to the effect of potential exchange rate fluctuations to the
extent that amounts are repatriated from Mexico to the U.S. However
 we
currently anticipate that the future cash flows of our Mexican subsidiaries will
be reinvested in our Mexican operations. In addition
 the Mexican peso exchange
rate can directly and indirectly impact our financial condition and results of
operations in several ways
 including potential economic recession in Mexico
because of devaluation of their currency. The impact on our financial position
and results of operations resulting from a hypothetical change in the exchange
rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso cannot be reasonably
estimated. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses
 representing the change
in the U.S. dollar value of the net monetary assets of our Mexican subsidiaries
denominated in Mexican pesos
 was a loss of $4.4 million in 2013
 a gain of $4.9
million in 2012 and a loss of $12.6 million in 2011. The average exchange rates
for 2013
 2012 and 2011 were 12.75 Mexican pesos to 1 U.S. dollar
 13.16 Mexican
pesos to 1 U.S. dollar and 12.39 Mexican pesos to 1 U.S. dollar
 respectively.
No assurance can be given as to how future movements in the Mexican peso could
affect our future financial condition or results of operations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

financial instruments
 specifically exchange-traded forward contracts
 in an
attempt to mitigate foreign currency transaction exposure on U.S.
dollar-denominated purchases. As of December 29
 2013
 our Mexico operations
held no foreign currency derivative instruments. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Certain
retirement plans that we sponsor invest in a variety of financial instruments.
We have analyzed our portfolios of investments and
 to the best of our
knowledge
 none of our investments
 including money market funds units
commercial paper and municipal securities
 have been downgraded
 and neither we
nor any fund in which we participate hold significant amounts of structured
investment vehicles
 auction rate securities
 collateralized debt obligations
credit derivatives
 hedge funds investments
 fund of funds investments or
perpetual preferred securities. Certain postretirement funds in which we
participate hold significant amounts of mortgage-backed securities. However
none of the mortgages collateralizing these securities are considered
subprime.



Impact of
 Due to low to moderate inflation
in the U.S. and Mexico and our rapid inventory turnover rate
 the results of
operations have not been significantly affected by inflation during the past
three-year period.
Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data 
Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December 29
 2013 and December 30
 2012
 and the related consolidated statements
of operations
 comprehensive income (loss)
 stockholders' equity
 and cash flows
for the fifty-two weeks ended December 29
 2013 and the fifty-three weeks ended
December 30
 2012. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial
statements
 we have also audited financial statement schedule II
 Valuation and
Qualifying Accounts
 as of and for the fifty-two weeks ended December 29
 2013
and the fifty-three weeks ended December 30
 2012. These consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion
 the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation as of
December 29
 2013 and December 30
 2012
 and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for the fifty-two weeks ended December 29
 2013
and the fifty-three weeks ended December 30
 2012
 in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also
 in our opinion
 the related
financial statement schedule
 when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole
 presents fairly
 in all
material respects
 the information set forth therein. 
We also have audited the retrospective
adjustments applied to earnings per share in the 2011 consolidated financial
statements as described in &#147;Note 13. Stockholders' Equity&#148; under the section
&#147;Rights Offering.&#148; In our opinion
 such adjustments are appropriate and have
been properly applied. We were not engaged to audit
 review
 or apply any
procedures to the 2011 consolidated financial statements of the Company other
than with respect to the adjustments and
 accordingly
 we do not express an
opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2011 consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole. 
We also have audited
 in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States)
 Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's internal control over financial reporting
as of December 29
 2013
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
 and our report dated February
21
 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.

BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Pilgrim&#146;s
Pride Corporation (referred to herein as &#147;Pilgrim&#146;s
&#148; &#147;PPC
&#148; &#147;the Company
&#148;
&#147;we
&#148; &#147;us
&#148; &#147;our
&#148; or similar terms) is one of the largest chicken companies in
the United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;)
 Mexico and Puerto Rico. Our fresh chicken retail
line is sold in the southeastern
 central
 southwestern and western regions of
the U.S.
 throughout Puerto Rico
 and in the northern and central regions of
Mexico. Our prepared-foods products meet the needs of some of the largest
customers in the food service industry across the U.S. Additionally
 the Company
exports commodity chicken products to approximately 100 countries. As a
vertically integrated company
 we control every phase of the production of our
products. We operate feed mills
 hatcheries
 processing plants and distribution
centers in 12 U.S. states
 Puerto Rico and Mexico. Our fresh chicken products
consist of refrigerated (nonfrozen) whole or cut-up chicken
 either
pre-marinated or non-marinated
 and prepackaged chicken in various combinations
of freshly refrigerated
 whole chickens and chicken parts. Our prepared chicken
products include portion-controlled breast fillets
 tenderloins and strips
delicatessen products
 salads
 formed nuggets and patties and bone-in chicken
parts. These products are sold either refrigerated or frozen and may be fully
cooked
 partially cooked or raw. In addition
 these products are breaded or
non-breaded and either pre-marinated or non-marinated. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 2008
 Pilgrim's and six of its subsidiaries filed
voluntary petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Texas
 Fort Worth Division (the &#147;Bankruptcy Court&#148;)
 seeking
reorganization relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the
United States Code. We emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings on
December 28
 2009. In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy
 our common
stock outstanding immediately prior to the emergence was cancelled and converted
into the right to receive newly-issued shares of common stock of the reorganized
Company based on a one-for-one exchange ratio
 which constituted 36.0% of the
total number of shares of our newly-issued common stock on that date. The
remaining shares of our newly-issued common stock
 constituting 64.0% of our
total issued and outstanding common stock on December 28
 2009
 were purchased
for $800.0 million by JBS USA Holdings
 Inc. (&#147;JBS USA&#148;)
 a wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary of JBS S.A.
 a Brazil-based meat producer. As the result of
subsequent purchases
 JBS USA owned 75.5% of our total issued and outstanding
common stock on December 29
 2013. 
Consolidated Financial Statements

on the Sunday falling on or before December 31. The reader should assume any
reference we make to a particular year (for example
 2013) in the notes to these
Consolidated Financial Statements applies to our fiscal year and not the
calendar year. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pride Corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries. We eliminate all
significant affiliate accounts and transactions upon consolidation. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

as if the U.S. dollar were the functional currency. Accordingly
 we remeasure
assets and liabilities
 other than non-monetary assets
 of the Mexico
subsidiaries at current exchange rates. We remeasure nonmonetary assets using
the historical exchange rate in effect on the date of each asset's acquisition.
We remeasure income and expenses at average exchange rates in effect during the
period
 except for certain accounts which are remeasured at a historical rate.
Currency exchange gains or losses are included in the line item 
Reclassifications

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Financial Statements with no impact to reported net income (loss) in order to
conform to the 2013 presentation. 
Revenue Recognition

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exits
 (ii) price is fixed
or determinable
 (iii) collectability is reasonably assured and (iv) delivery
has occurred. Delivery occurs in the period in which the customer takes title
and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the products specified in the
customer's purchase order or sales agreement. Revenue is recorded net of
estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements
 promotions
and other volume-based incentives. Revisions to these estimates are charged back
to net sales in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision
become known. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental
authorities are excluded from revenues.

Shipping and Handling Costs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

cost of sales. 
Advertising Costs

The Company
expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs are included in
selling
 general and administrative expenses and totaled $4.9 million
 $6.5
million and $9.6 million for 2013
 2012 and 2011
 respectively. 
Research and Development Costs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

development costs totaled $3.9 million
 $3.8 million and $5.0 million for 2013
2012 and 2011
 respectively. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The majority of the
Company's disbursement bank accounts are zero balance accounts where cash needs
are funded as checks are presented for payment by the holder. Checks issued
pending clearance that result in overdraft balances for accounting purposes are
classified as accounts payable and the change in the related balance is
reflected in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Current and Long-Term Investments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

fixed income securities
 municipal debt securities
 bond and equity mutual funds
and fund-of-funds. These investments are classified as available-for-sale. These
securities are recorded at fair value
 and unrealized holding gains and losses
are recorded
 net of tax
 as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Debt securities with remaining maturities of less than one
year and those identified by management at the time of purchase for funding
operations in less than one year are classified as current. Debt securities with
remaining maturities greater than one year that management has not identified at
the time of purchase for funding operations in less than one year are classified
as long-term. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline
in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. Management reviews
several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary
 such as the
length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position
 the extent to which
fair value is less than amortized cost
 the impact of changing interest rates in
the short and long term
 and the Company&#146;s intent and ability to hold the
security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
in fair value. The Company determines the cost of each security sold and each
amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings
using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a
trade date basis. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

greater than 50% and exercises control over the entity are consolidated in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Investments in entities in which the Company
has an ownership interest between 20% and 50% and exercises significant
influence are accounted for using the equity method. The Company invests from
time to time in ventures in which its ownership interest is less than 20% and
over which it does not exercise significant influence. Such investments are
accounted for under the cost method. The fair values for investments not traded
on a quoted exchange are estimated based upon the historical performance of the
ventures
 the ventures&#146; forecasted financial performance and management&#146;s
evaluation of the ventures&#146; viability and business models. To the extent the
book value of an investment exceeds its assessed fair value
 the Company will
record an appropriate impairment charge. Thus
 the carrying value of the
Company&#146;s investments approximates fair value. 
Accounts Receivable

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

record an allowance for doubtful accounts
 reducing our receivables balance to
an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers. Estimates used in
determining the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on historical
collection experience
 current trends
 aging of accounts receivable
 and
periodic credit evaluations of our customers&#146; financial condition. We write off
accounts receivable when it becomes apparent
 based upon age or customer
circumstances
 that such amounts will not be collected. Generally
 the Company
does not require collateral for its accounts receivable. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

breeder hens at the lower of cost
 less accumulated amortization
 or market. The
costs associated with breeder hens are accumulated up to the production stage
and amortized over their productive lives using the unit-of-production method.
Finished poultry products
 feed
 eggs and other inventories are stated at the
lower of cost (average) or market. 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
We record
valuation adjustments for our inventory and for estimated obsolescence at or
equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market
value based upon known conditions affecting inventory
 including significantly
aged products
 discontinued product lines
 or damaged or obsolete products. We
allocate meat costs between our various finished chicken products based on a
by-product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by
estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by-product parts. This
primarily includes leg quarters
 wings
 tenders and offal
 which are carried in
inventory at the estimated recovery amounts
 with the remaining amount being
reflected as our breast meat cost. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 the Company performs an evaluation of whether any lower of
cost or market adjustments are required at the country level based on a number
of factors
 including: (i) pools of related inventory
 (ii) product continuation
or discontinuation
 (iii) estimated market selling prices and (iv) expected
distribution channels. If actual market conditions or other factors are less
favorable than those projected by management
 additional inventory adjustments
may be required. 
Property
 Plant and Equipment

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 plant and equipment are stated at cost
 and repair and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Estimated
useful lives for building
 machinery and equipment are five to 33 years and for
automobiles and trucks are three to ten years. The charge to income resulting
from amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included with
depreciation expense. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than
the carrying amount of those assets. When the above is true
 the impairment
charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets
exceeds their fair market value. In making these determinations
 the Company
utilizes certain assumptions
 including
 but not limited to: (i) future cash
flows estimated to be generated by these assets
 which are based on additional
assumptions such as asset utilization
 remaining length of service and estimated
salvage values
 (ii) estimated fair market value of the assets and (iii)
determinations with respect to the lowest level of cash flows relevant to the
respective impairment test
 generally groupings of related operational
facilities. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the production process
 which operate as a vertically integrated network
 and
the fact that the Company does not price the transfers of inventory between its
vertically integrated facilities at market prices
 it evaluates impairment of
assets held for use at the country level (i.e.
 the U.S. and Mexico). Management
believes this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for its assets that
are held for use in production activities. At the present time
 the Company&#146;s
forecasts indicate that it can recover the carrying value of its assets held for
use based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the operations. A key
assumption in management&#146;s forecast is that the Company&#146;s sales volumes will
return to historical margins as supply and demand between commodities and
chicken and other animal-based proteins become more balanced. However
 the exact
timing of the return to historical margins is not certain
 and if the return to
historical margins is delayed
 impairment charges could become necessary in the
future. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

when the carrying amount of those assets exceeds their fair value less
appropriate selling costs. Fair value is based on amounts documented in sales
contracts or letters of intent accepted by the Company
 amounts included in
counteroffers initiated by the Company
 or
 in the absence of current contract
negotiations
 amounts determined using a sales comparison approach for real
property and amounts determined using a cost approach for personal property.
Under the sales comparison approach
 sales and asking prices of reasonably
comparable properties are considered to develop a range of unit prices within
which the current real estate market is operating. Under the cost approach
 a
current cost to replace the asset new is calculated and then the estimated
replacement cost is reduced to reflect the applicable decline in value resulting
from physical deterioration
 functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence.
Appropriate selling costs includes reasonable broker's commissions
 costs to
produce title documents
 filing fees
 legal expenses and the like. We estimate
appropriate closing costs as 4% to 6% of asset fair value. This range of rates
is considered reasonable for our assets held for sale based on historical
experience. 
Identified Intangible Assets

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

amortization such as trade names
 customer relationships and non-compete
agreements. We calculate amortization of those assets that are subject to
amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets. The useful lives range from three to 15 years for trade names
and non-compete agreements and 13 years for customer relationships. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying values of
the assets may not be recoverable. We test intangible assets subject to
amortization for impairment and estimate their fair values using the same
assumptions and techniques we employ on property
 plant and
equipment.&nbsp;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Litigation and Contingent
Liabilities 
The Company is
subject to lawsuits
 investigations and other claims related to employment
environmental
 product and other matters. The Company is required to assess the
likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes
 as well as potential ranges of
probable losses
 to these matters. The Company estimates the amount of reserves
required for these contingencies when losses are determined to be probable and
after considerable analysis of each individual issue. The Company expenses legal
costs related to such loss contingencies as they are incurred. The accrual for
environmental remediation liabilities is measured on an undiscounted basis.
These reserves may change in the future due to changes in the Company&#146;s
assumptions
 the effectiveness of strategies
 or other factors beyond the
Company&#146;s control. 
Accrued Self Insurance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

benefits are estimated using historical and current experience and actuarial
estimates. Stop-loss coverage is maintained with third-party insurers to limit
the Company&#146;s total exposure. Certain categories of claim liabilities are
actuarially determined. The assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are
reviewed regularly by management. However
 actual expenses could differ from
these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

-Income Taxes topic with regards to members of a group that file a consolidated
tax return but issue separate financial statements. The Company files its own
U.S. federal tax return
 but is included in certain state consolidated returns
with JBS USA. The income tax expense of the Company is computed using the
separate return method. The provision for income taxes has been determined using
the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this
approach
 deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities
net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. The amount of deferred tax
on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates expected to
apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled
 as
applicable
 based on the tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction
enacted as of the balance sheet date. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income
 potential
for carry back of tax losses
 projected future taxable income
 applicable tax
strategies
 and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary
differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not
that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Valuation
allowances have been established primarily for net operating loss carry forwards
of certain foreign subsidiaries. See &#147;Note 11. Income Taxes&#148; to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 2013 to be
permanently reinvested. As such
 U.S. deferred income taxes have not been
provided on these earnings. If such earnings were not considered indefinitely
reinvested
 certain deferred foreign and U.S. income taxes would be provided.
For activity after 2008
 the Company did not permanently reinvest its earnings
in Puerto Rico. Therefore
 net earnings generated in Puerto Rico have U.S. taxes
provided as if the earnings were distributed. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement
recognition of a tax benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax
benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not
 based on the
technical merits
 that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax
benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured
using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has
greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit
is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances
evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date. See
&#147;Note 11. Income Taxes&#148; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Pension and Other Postemployment
Benefits 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

dependent on the various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts.
These assumptions relate to discount rates
 long-term return on plan assets and
other factors. We base the discount rate assumptions on current investment
yields on high-quality corporate long-term bonds. 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
The salary
growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual experience and future or
near-term outlook. We determine the long-term return on plan assets based on
historical portfolio results and management&#146;s expectation of the future economic
environment. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated
and
 if in excess of the lesser of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or
the fair market value of plan assets
 amortized over either (i) the estimated
average future service period of active plan participants if the plan is active
or (ii) the estimated average future life expectancy of all plan participants if
the plan is frozen. 
Operating Leases

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

over the lease term unless the lease contains an escalation clause which is not
fixed or determinable. The lease term begins when we have the right to control
the use of the leased property
 which is typically before rent payments are due
under the terms of the lease. If a lease has a fixed or determinable escalation
clause
 the difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as
deferred rent and is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rent for
operating leases that do not have an escalation clause or where escalation is
based on an inflation index is expensed over the lease term as it is payable.

Risk Management

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

program of risk management that includes the use of forward purchase contractual
obligations and derivative financial instruments. The Company will also
occasionally purchase derivative financial instruments in an attempt to mitigate
currency exchange rate exposure related to the net assets of its Mexico
operations that are denominated in Mexican pesos. The Company's Mexico
subsidiaries also attempt to mitigate the foreign currency exposure on certain
U.S. dollar-denominated transactions through the use of derivative financial
instruments. We recognize all derivative financial instruments in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We elected not to designate
derivative financial instruments executed to mitigate commodity purchase
exposures and foreign currency exposures as hedges of forecasted transactions.
Therefore
 we recognize changes in the fair value of these derivative financial
instruments immediately in earnings. Gains or losses related to the commodity
 in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains or losses related to the foreign
currency derivative financial instruments are included in the line item
Selling
 general and administrative
 in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. 
Use of Estimates

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
We make significant estimates in regard to receivables collectability; inventory
valuation; realization of deferred tax assets; valuation of long-lived assets;
valuation of contingent liabilities
 liabilities subject to compromise and self
insurance liabilities; valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits
obligations; and valuation of acquired businesses. 
2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 representing the amount that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities measured at fair
value must be categorized into one of three different levels depending on the
assumptions (i.e.
 inputs) used in the valuation: 


    
    
Unadjusted quoted prices
      in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
  
    
    
    

    
    
Quoted prices in active
      markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are observable
      for the asset or liability; or
  
    
    
    

    
    
Unobservable inputs
 such
      as discounted cash flow models or
valuations.
The
determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is
based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety.&nbsp;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 2013 and December 30
 2012
 the Company held certain
items that were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
These included derivative assets and liabilities and deferred compensation plan
assets. Derivative assets and liabilities consist of long and short positions on
exchange-traded commodity and foreign currency&nbsp;derivative instruments. The
Company maintains nonqualified deferred compensation plans for executives and
other highly compensated employees. Investments are maintained within a trust
and include money market funds
 mutual funds and life insurance policies. The
cash surrender value of the life insurance policies is invested primarily in
mutual funds. The following items were measured at fair value on a recurring
basis:

The valuation
of financial assets and liabilities classified in Level 1 is determined using a
market approach
 taking into account current interest rates
 creditworthiness
and liquidity risks in relation to current market conditions
 and is based upon
unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. The valuation
of financial assets and liabilities in Level 2 is determined using a market
approach based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets or other inputs that are observable for substantially the full term of
the financial instrument. The valuation of financial assets in Level 3 is
determined using an income approach based on unobservable inputs such as
discounted cash flow models or valuations.

instruments. Certain postretirement funds in which the Company participates hold
significant amounts of mortgage-backed securities. However
 none of the
mortgages collateralizing these securities are considered subprime. 
6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 including
corn
 soybean meal
 soybean oil
 sorghum
 natural gas
 electricity and diesel
fuel
 which are all considered commodities. The Company considers these raw
materials generally available from a number of different sources and believes it
can obtain them to meet its requirements. These commodities are subject to price
fluctuations and related price risk due to factors beyond our control
 such as
economic and political conditions
 supply and demand
 weather
 governmental
regulation and other circumstances. Generally
 the Company purchases derivative
financial instruments
 specifically exchange-traded futures and options
 in an
attempt to mitigate price risk related to its anticipated consumption of
commodity inputs for approximately the next 12 months. The Company may purchase
longer-term derivative financial instruments on particular commodities if deemed
appropriate. The Company will sometimes take a short position on a derivative
instrument to minimize the impact of a commodity's price volatility on its
operating results. The Company will also occasionally purchase derivative
financial instruments in an attempt to mitigate currency exchange rate exposure
related to the net assets of its Mexico operations that are denominated in
Mexican pesos. The fair value of derivative assets is included in the line item
Prepaid expenses and other current assets
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while the
fair value of derivative liabilities is included in the line item
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities
on the same statements. Our counterparties
require that we post cash collateral for changes in the net fair value of the
derivative contracts. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

purchased to mitigate commodity purchase or foreign currency transaction
exposures as cash flow hedges. Therefore
 we recognize changes in the fair value
of these derivative financial instruments immediately in earnings. Gains or
losses related to these derivative financial instruments are included in either
Selling
 in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations based upon the business purpose of the
associated exposure. The Company recognized $25.1 million
 $8.3 million and
$63.8 million in net gains related to changes in the fair value of its
derivative financial instruments during 2013
 2012 and 2011
respectively.

JBS Subordinated Loan Agreement

On June 23
 2011
 the Company
entered into a Subordinated Loan Agreement with JBS USA (the &#147;Subordinated Loan
Agreement&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Loan Agreement
 the
Company agreed to reimburse JBS USA up to $56.5 million for draws upon any
letters of credit issued for JBS USA's account that support certain obligations
of the Company or its subsidiaries. JBS USA agreed to arrange for letters of
credit to be issued on its account in the amount of $56.5 million to an
insurance company serving the Company in order to allow that insurance company
to return cash it held as collateral against potential workers compensation
auto and general liability claims. In return for providing this letter of
credit
 the Company has agreed to reimburse JBS USA for the letter of credit
cost the Company would otherwise incur under its U.S. Credit Facility (as
defined below). The total amount paid by the Company for 2013
 2012 and 2011
costs
 to reimburse JBS USA
 was $2.2 million
 $2.2 million and $0.4 million
respectively. As of December 29
 2013
 the Company has accrued an obligation of
$0.1 million to reimburse JBS USA for letter of credit costs incurred on its
behalf. There remains no other commitment to make advances by JBS USA under the
Subordinated Loan Agreement. 

Pilgrim&#146;s and certain of its
subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the &#147;U.S. Credit Facility&#148;) with
CoBank
 ACB
 as administrative agent and collateral agent
 and other lenders
party thereto
7
 2013. The U.S. Credit Facility currently provides for a $700.0 million
revolving credit facility
 a Term B facility of
approximately $410.1 million and a delayed draw term loan commitment of up to $400 million (the
&#147;Delayed Draw Term Loans&#148;). The Company can draw upon the Delayed Draw Term Loan
commitment
 in one or more advances
 between May 1
 2014 and December 28
 2014.
The U.S. Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature that allows us
 at
any time
 to increase the aggregate revolving loan commitment by up to an
additional $250.0 million and to increase the aggregate Delayed Draw Term Loan
commitment by up to an additional $500.0 million
 in each case subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions
 including obtaining the lenders&#146; agreement
to participate in the increase and an aggregate limit on all commitments under
the U.S. Credit Facility of $1.85 billion. The U.S. Credit Facility also
provides for a $100 million sub-limit for swingline loans and a $200 million
sub-limit for letters of credit. The Term B Loans mature on December 28
 2014
with all principal and unpaid interest due at maturity. The revolving loan
commitment under the U.S. Credit Facility matures on August 7
 2018. Any Delayed
Draw Term Loans would be payable in quarterly installments beginning in fiscal
year 2015 equal to 1.875% of the principal outstanding as of December 28
 2014
with all remaining principal and interest due at maturity on August 7
 2018.

On December 28
 2009
 the Company
paid loan costs totaling $50.0 million related to the U.S. Credit Facility that
it recognized as an asset on its balance sheet. On August 7
 2013
 the Company
paid loan costs totaling $5.0 million related to the amendment and restatement
to the U.S. Credit Facility that is recognized as an asset on its balance sheet.
The Company amortizes these capitalized costs to interest expense over the life
of the U.S. Credit Facility. 
Subsequent to the end of each fiscal
year
 a portion of our cash flow must be used to repay outstanding principal
amounts under the Term B loans. With respect to 2013
 the Company paid $204.9
million of its cash flow toward the outstanding principal under the Term B-1
loans on December 30

 and expects to pay approximately $205.2 million of
its cash flow toward the outstanding principal under the Term B-2 loans on April
28
 2014. Following the April 28
 2014 payment
 the Company will have no
outstanding principal under the Term B loans. The U.S. Credit Facility also
requires us to use the proceeds we receive from certain asset sales and
specified debt or equity issuances and upon the occurrence of other events to
repay outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Credit Facility. On December 29
2013
 a principal amount of $410.1 million under the Term B loans commitment was
outstanding.
Actual borrowings by the Company
under the revolving credit commitment component of the U.S. Credit Facility are
subject to a borrowing base
 which is a formula based on certain eligible
inventory
 eligible receivables and restricted cash under the control of CoBank
ACB. As of December 29
 2013
 the applicable borrowing base was $695.4 million
the amount available for borrowing under the revolving loan commitment was
$665.8 million. The Company had letters of credit of $29.6 million and no
outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan commitment as of December 29
2013. 
The U.S. Credit Facility contains
financial covenants and various other covenants that may adversely affect our
ability to
 among other things
 incur additional indebtedness
 incur liens
 pay
dividends or make certain restricted payments
 consummate certain assets sales
enter into certain transactions with JBS USA and our other affiliates
 merge
consolidate and/or sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.
The U.S. Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with a minimum level of
tangible net worth covenant. The Company is currently in compliance with this
financial covenant. All other financial covenants were eliminated in connection
with the August 7
 2013 amendment and restatement to the U.S. Credit Facility.
The U.S. Credit Facility also provides that the Company may not incur capital
expenditures in excess of $350.0 million in any fiscal year.

Mexico Credit Facility

On October 19

 S.A. de C.V. (&#147;Avicola&#148;)
 Pilgrim&#146;s Pride S. de R.L.
de C.V. and certain other Mexican subsidiaries entered into an amended and
restated credit agreement (the &#147;Mexico Credit Facility&#148;) with ING Bank (M&#233;xico)
S.A. Instituci&#243;n de Banca M&#250;ltiple
 ING Grupo Financiero
 as lender and ING
Capital LLC
 as administrative agent. The Mexico Credit Facility has a final
maturity date of September 25
 2014. The Mexico Credit Facility is secured by
substantially all of the assets of the Company&#146;s Mexico subsidiaries. As of
December 29
 2013
 the U.S. dollar-equivalent of the loan commitment under the
Mexico Credit Facility was $42.7 million. There were no outstanding borrowings
under the Mexico Credit Facility at December 29
 2013.
Under the Mexico Credit Facility
 if
(i) any default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or (ii) the
quotient of the borrowing base divided by the outstanding loans and letters of
credit (the &#147;Collateral Coverage Ratio&#148;) under the Mexico Credit Facility is
less than 1.25 to 1.00
 the loans and letters of credit under the Mexico Credit
Facility will be subject to
 and cannot exceed
 a borrowing base. The borrowing
base is a formula based on accounts receivable
 inventory
 prepaid assets
 net
cash under the control of the administrative agent and up to 150.0 million
Mexican pesos of fixed assets of our Mexico subsidiaries party to the Mexico
Credit Facility. The borrowing base formula will be reduced by trade payables of
those Mexico subsidiaries. If the Collateral Coverage Ratio falls below 1.25 to
1.00
 the borrowing base requirement would terminate upon the earlier of (i) the
Collateral Coverage Ratio exceeding 1.25 to 1.00 as of the latest measurement
period for 60 consecutive days or (ii) the borrowing availability under the
Mexico Credit Facility being equal to or greater than the greater of 20% of the
revolving commitments under the Mexico Credit Facility and 100.0 million Mexican
pesos for a period of 60 consecutive days. 
Avicola may pay dividends or make
other restricted payments to the Company in an amount not to exceed in the
aggregate 250.0 million Mexican pesos during the term of the Mexico Credit
Facility if certain conditions are satisfied
 including a condition that
availability is at least 100% of the revolving loan commitment under the Mexico
Credit Facility
 less any letter of credit liability under the Mexico Credit
Facility. However
 the Company deems its earnings from Mexico as of December 29
2013 to be permanently reinvested. As such
 U.S. deferred income taxes have not
been provided on these earnings. If such earnings were not considered
indefinitely reinvested
 certain deferred foreign and U.S. income taxes would be
provided. 

Substantially all of our domestic
inventories and domestic fixed assets are pledged as collateral to secure the
obligations under the U.S. Credit Facility. The Mexico Credit Facility is
secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company's Mexico subsidiaries.

The effective tax rate
for continuing operations for 2013 was 4.2% compared to (13.7)% for 2012. The
effective tax rate for 2013 differed from 2012 primarily as a result of smaller
decreases in the valuation allowance and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits
during 2013 compared to decreases in the valuation allowance and reserves for
unrecognized tax benefits during 2012.

The effective tax rate for

In assessing the realizability of
deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax
liabilities (including the impact of available carry back and carry forward
periods)
 projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies in making
this assessment. 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
As of December 29
 2013
 the Company
believes it has sufficient positive evidence to conclude that realization of its
federal and state net deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be
realized. The decrease in valuation allowance of $178.0 million during 2013 was
primarily due to a decrease in federal
 state and foreign net operating losses.
As of December 29
 2013
 the Company's valuation allowance is $10.4 million
 of
which $1.9 million relates to capital loss carry forwards and $8.5 million
relates to its Mexico operations.
As of December 29
 2013
 the Company
had state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $459.6 million that
will begin to expire in 2014. The Company also had Mexico net operating loss
carry forwards at December 29
 2013 of approximately $51.5 million that begin to
expire in 2014. 
As of December 29
 2013
 the Company
had approximately $63.2 million of federal tax credit carry forwards that will
begin to expire in 2024 and $2.7 million of state tax credit carry forwards that
begin to expire in 2014. 
On November 6
 2009
 H.R. 3548 was
signed into law and included a provision that allowed most business taxpayers an
increased carry back period for net operating losses incurred in 2008 or 2009.
As a result
 during 2009 the Company utilized $547.7 million of its U.S. federal
net operating losses under the expanded carry back provisions of H.R. 3548 and
filed a claim for refund of $169.7 million. The Company received $122.6 million
in refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) from the carry back claims
during 2010. The Company anticipates receipt of the remainder of its claim
pending resolution of its litigation with the IRS. See &#147;Note 17. Commitments and
Contingencies&#148; for additional information. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986
 as amended (the IRC)
 imposes an annual limit on the ability of
a corporation that undergoes an &#147;ownership change&#148; to use its U.S. net operating
losses and tax credits to reduce its tax liability. The Company experienced an
ownership change in December 2009
 but believes that utilization of the U.S. net
operating losses and tax credits will not be hindered by the Section 382
limitation. 
The Company has not provided any
deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its Mexico subsidiaries
as of December 29
 2013 based upon the determination that such earnings will be
indefinitely reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the amount of
incremental taxes that might arise if these earnings were to be remitted. For
activity after 2008
 the Company is not permanently reinvesting its earnings in
Puerto Rico. Therefore
 the earnings generated in Puerto Rico have U.S. taxes
provided on the earnings as if the earnings were distributed. 
During 2011
 the Company completed
its deconsolidation of its Mexico operations from a tax perspective to help
minimize the impact of the Mexico tax reform that became effective January 1
2010. As a result
 all of the Mexico subsidiaries started filing separate
returns in 2011. The deconsolidation reduced the accrued taxes that had been
previously recognized under the consolidated filing status as it eliminated
recapturing certain taxes required under the new consolidation laws. As a result
of the deconsolidation
 the Company recognized a benefit of $4.3 million and
$29.5 million during 2011 and 2010
 respectively
 which reduced the additional
taxes that had been previously accrued as of December 27
 2009
 resulting in a
total net benefit of $18.4 million. 
A reconciliation of the beginning
and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in unrecognized tax

 if recognized
 would reduce the Company's effective tax rate. It
is not practicable at this time to estimate the amount of unrecognized tax
benefits that will change in the next twelve months. 
The Company recognizes interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income
taxes. As of December 29
 2013
 the Company had recorded a liability of $9.9
million for interest and penalties. During 2013
 accrued interest and penalty
amounts related to uncertain tax positions remained unchanged from 2012.




NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
The Company operates in the U.S.
(including multiple state jurisdictions)
 Puerto Rico and Mexico. With few
exceptions
 the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal
 state or local
income tax examinations for years prior to 2008 and is no longer subject to
Mexico income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to 2008.

The Company is currently working
with the IRS through the normal processes and procedures that are available to
all taxpayers outside of bankruptcy to resolve the IRS' proof of claim. In
connection
 the Company has filed various petitions in the United States Tax
Court (&#147;Tax Court&#148;) in response to the Notices of Deficiency that were issued to
the Company. On December 12
 2012
 the Company entered into two Stipulation of
Settled Issues (&#147;Stipulation&#148; or &#147;Stipulations&#148;) with the IRS that resolved a
portion of the IRS' proof of claim. The Company is pursuing the IRS' amended
proof of claim relating to the tax year ended June 20
 2004 for Gold Kist Inc.
(&#147;Gold Kist&#148;). See &#147;Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies&#148; for additional
information. 
On September 13
 2013
 the IRS
issued the final
 revised Tangible Property Repair Regulations for IRC Sections
162(a) and 263(a) which modify and supersede the Temporary Regulations that were
issued on December 23
 2011. In addition
 the IRS also released new proposed
regulations for dispositions of tangible property under IRC Section 168. These
final and proposed regulations are effective for tax years beginning January 1
2014. The Company assessed the applicability of the regulations and concluded
there was no significant impact to the Company&#146;s tax fixed assets.
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT
BENEFITS 
The Company sponsors programs that
provide retirement benefits to most of its employees. These programs include
qualified defined benefit pension plans
 nonqualified defined benefit retirement
plans
 a defined benefit postretirement life insurance plan
 and defined
contribution retirement savings plans. Under all of our retirement plans
 the
Company&#146;s expenses were $7.5 million
 $8.7 million and $7.9 million in 2013
2012 and 2011
 respectively. 
The Company used a year-end
measurement date of December 29
 2013 for its pension and postretirement
benefits plans. Certain disclosures are listed below. Other disclosures are not
material to the financial statements. 
Qualified Defined Benefit Pension
Plans 
The Company sponsors two qualified
defined benefit pension plans named the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Retirement Plan for
Union Employees (the &#147;Union Plan&#148;) and the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Pension Plan for
Legacy Gold Kist Employees (the &#147;GK Pension Plan&#148;). The Union Plan covers
certain locations or work groups within PPC. The GK Pension Plan covers certain
eligible U.S. employees who were employed at locations that the Company
purchased through its acquisition of Gold Kist in 2007. Participation in the GK
Pension Plan was frozen as of February 8
 2007 for all participants with the
exception of terminated vested participants who are or may become permanently
and totally disabled. The plan was frozen for that group as of March 31
 2007.

Nonqualified Defined Benefit Pension
Plans 
The Company sponsors two
nonqualified defined benefit retirement plans named the Former Gold Kist Inc.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the &#147;SERP Plan&#148;) and the Former Gold
Kist Inc. Directors&#146; Emeriti Retirement Plan (the &#147;Directors&#146; Emeriti Plan&#148;).
Pilgrim&#146;s Pride assumed sponsorship of the SERP Plan and Directors&#146; Emeriti Plan
through its acquisition of Gold Kist in 2007. The SERP Plan provides benefits on
compensation in excess of certain IRC limitations to certain former executives
with whom Gold Kist negotiated individual agreements. Benefits under the SERP
Plan were frozen as of February 8
 2007. The Directors&#146; Emeriti Plan provides
benefits to former Gold Kist directors. 
Defined Benefit Postretirement Life
Insurance Plan 
The Company sponsors one defined
benefit postretirement life insurance plan named the Gold Kist Inc. Retiree Life
Insurance Plan (the &#147;Retiree Life Plan&#148;). Pilgrim&#146;s Pride also assumed defined
benefit postretirement medical and life insurance obligations
 including the
Retiree Life Plan
 through its acquisition of Gold Kist in 2007. In January
2001
 Gold Kist began to substantially curtail its programs for active
employees. On July 1
 2003
 Gold Kist terminated medical coverage for retirees
age 65 or older
 and only retired employees in the closed group between ages 55
and 65 could continue their coverage at rates above the average cost of the
medical insurance plan for active employees. These retired employees all reached
the age of 65 in 2012 and liabilities of the postretirement medical plan then
ended.

The expected rate of return on plan
assets was determined based on the current interest rate environment and
historical market premiums relative to the fixed income rates of equities and
other asset classes. We also take into consideration anticipated asset
allocations
 investment strategies and the views of various investment
professionals when developing this rate. 

The following table reflects the
pension plans&#146; actual asset allocations:

We have
      made certain reclassifications to the December 30
 2012 asset allocation
      with no impact to total reported plan assets in order to conform to the
      December 29
 2013 presentation.
  
    
    
Pooled
      separate accounts (PSAs) and common collective trust funds (CCTs) are
      two of the most common types of alternative vehicles in which benefit
      plans invest. These investments are pooled funds that look like mutual
      funds
 but they are not registered with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission. Often times
 they will be invested in mutual funds or other
      marketable securities
 but the unit price generally will be different from
      the value of the underlying securities because the fund may also hold cash
      for liquidity purposes
 and the fees imposed by the fund are deducted from
      the fund value rather than charged separately to investors. Some PSAs and
      CCTs have no restrictions as to their investment strategy and can invest
      in riskier investments
 such as derivatives
 hedge funds
 private equity
      funds
 or similar investments.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
Absent regulatory or statutory
limitations
 the target asset allocation for the investment of the assets for
our ongoing pension plans is 30% in fixed income securities and 70% in equity
securities. The plans only invest in fixed income and equity instruments for
which there is a ready public market. We develop our expected long-term rate of
return assumptions based on the historical rates of returns for equity and fixed
income securities of the type in which our plans invest.
The fair value measurements of plan
assets fell into the following levels of the fair value hierarchy as of December
29

We have
      made certain reclassifications to the December 30
 2012 fair value
      hierarchy with no impact to total reported plan assets in order to conform
      to the December 29
 2013 presentation.
  
    
    
Unadjusted
      quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are used to determine
      fair value.
  
    
    
Quoted
      prices in active markets for similar assets and inputs that are observable
      for the asset are used to determine fair value.
  
    
    
Unobservable inputs
 such as discounted cash flow models or
      valuations
 are used to determine fair value.
  
    
    
This
      category is comprised of investment options that invest in stocks
 or
      shares of ownership
 in large
 well-established U.S. companies. These
      investment options typically carry more risk than fixed income options but
      have the potential for higher returns over longer time
  periods.
  
    
    
This
      category is generally comprised of investment options that invest in
      stocks
 or shares of ownership
 in small to medium-sized U.S. companies.
      These investment options typically carry more risk than larger U.S. equity
      investment options but have the potential for higher returns.
  
    
    
This
      category is comprised of investment options that invest in stocks
 or
      shares of ownership
 in companies with their principal place of business

This
      category is comprised of investment options that invest in bonds
 or debt
      of a company or government entity (including U.S. and non-U.S. entities).
      It may also include real estate investment options that directly own
      property. These investment options typically carry more risk than short-term fixed income investment options (including
 for real estate
      investment options
 liquidity risk)
 but less overall risk than
      equities.
The valuation of plan assets in
Level 2 is determined using a market approach based upon quoted prices for
similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 or other inputs that are
observable for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 2
securities primarily include equity and fixed income securities funds.




NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

The following table reflects the
benefits as of December 29
 2013 expected to be paid in each of the next five
years and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter from our pension and
other postretirement plans. Because our pension plans are primarily funded
plans
 the anticipated benefits with respect to these plans will come primarily
from the trusts established for these plans. Because our other postretirement
plans are unfunded
 the anticipated benefits with respect to these plans will
come from our own assets.

The Company expects to recognize in
net pension cost throughout 2014 an actuarial loss of $0.1 million that was
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 29
 2013.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company sponsors two defined
contribution retirement savings plans named the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Retirement
Savings Plan (the &#147;RS Plan&#148;) and the To-Ricos Employee Savings and Retirement
Plan (the &#147;To-Ricos Plan&#148;). The RS Plan is an IRC Section 401(k) salary deferral
plan maintained for certain eligible US employees. Under the RS Plan
 eligible
U.S. employees may voluntarily contribute a percentage of their compensation.
The Company matches up to 30.0% of the first 2.14% to 6.00% of salary based on
the salary deferral and compensation levels up to $245
000. The To-Ricos Plan is
an IRC Section 1165(e) salary deferral plan maintained for certain eligible
Puerto Rican employees. Under the To-Ricos Plan
 eligible employees may
voluntarily contribute a percentage of their compensation and there are various
company matching provisions. The Company also maintains three postretirement
plans for eligible Mexico employees as required by Mexico law that primarily
cover termination benefits. 
The Company&#146;s expenses related to
its defined contribution plans totaled $3.9 million
 $5.7 million and $5.5
million in 2013
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.
Certain retirement plans that the
Company sponsors invest in a variety of financial instruments. Certain
postretirement funds in which the Company participates hold significant amounts
of mortgage-backed securities. However
 none of the mortgages collateralizing
these securities are considered subprime. 




NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY


In
January 2012
 Pilgrim's commenced the Rights Offering for stockholders of record
as of January 17
 2012 (the &#147;Record Date&#148;). The basic subscription privilege
gave stockholders the option to purchase 0.2072 shares of Pilgrim's common
stock
 rounded up to the next largest whole number
 at a subscription price of
$4.50 per share for each share of Pilgrim's common stock they owned as of the
Record Date. The multiplier was determined by dividing the 44
444
444 shares
being offered in the Rights Offering by the total number of shares owned by all
stockholders on the Record Date. Those stockholders that exercised their basic
subscription privilege in full also received an over-subscription privilege that
afforded them the opportunity to purchase additional shares at the subscription
price of $4.50 per share from a pool of the shares left over had all
stockholders not elected to exercise their basic subscription privileges in
full. JBS USA committed to participate in the Rights Offering and exercise its
basic and over-subscription privileges in full. The last day a stockholder could
exercise either their basic subscription rights or their over-subscription
rights was February 29
 2012. On March 7
 2012
 the Company issued 44
444
444
shares of common stock to stockholders that exercised their basic subscription
privileges and over-subscription privileges under the Rights Offering. Gross
proceeds received under the Rights Offering totaled $200.0 million. The Company
incurred costs directly attributable to the Rights Offering of $1.7 million that
it deferred and charged against the proceeds of the Rights Offering in
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company used the net
proceeds of $198.3 million for additional working capital to improve its capital
position and for general corporate purposes. Pilgrim's also used a portion of
the net proceeds to repay the outstanding principal amount of $50.0 million
plus accrued interest
 of its subordinated debt owed to JBS USA and to repay
indebtedness under the U.S. Credit Facility. 
The Rights Offering contained a
subscription price that was less than the fair value of the Company's common
stock on the last day the rights could be exercised. This price discount is
considered a bonus element similar to a stock dividend. Because of this bonus
element
 the Company adjusted both the weighted average basic and diluted shares
outstanding as reported in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29
 2011 by multiplying those
weighted average shares by an adjustment factor that represented the $6.40 fair
value of a share of the Company's common stock immediately prior to the exercise
of the basic and over-subscription privileges under the Rights Offering divided
by the $6.07 theoretical ex-rights fair value of a share of the Company's common
stock immediately prior to the exercise of the basic and over-subscription
privileges under the Rights Offering. Weighted average basic and diluted shares
outstanding and net loss per weighted average basic and diluted share for 2011
as originally reported and as adjusted for this bonus element were as follows:

Restrictions on Retained Earnings

Both The U.S. Credit Facility and
the indenture governing the 2018 Notes restrict
 but do not prohibit
 the
Company from declaring dividends. 
Antidilutive Common Stock
Equivalents 
Due to the net loss incurred during
2011
 the Company did not include 12
094 common stock equivalents in the
calculation of the denominator used for net loss per weighted average diluted
common share outstanding as these common stock equivalents would have been
antidilutive.

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

The
Company sponsors a short-term incentive plan that provides the grant of either
cash or share-based bonus awards payable upon achievement of specified
performance goals (the &#147;STIP&#148;). Full-time
 salaried exempt employees of the
Company and its affiliates who are selected by the administering committee are
eligible to participate in the STIP. The Company has accrued $25.8 million in
costs related to the STIP at December 29
 2013 related to cash bonus awards that
could potentially be awarded during 2014. 
The Company also sponsors a
performance-based
 omnibus long-term incentive plan that provides for the grant
of a broad range of long-term equity-based and cash-based awards to the
Company&#146;s officers and other employees
 members of the Board and any consultants
(the &#147;LTIP&#148;). The equity-based awards that may be granted under the LTIP include
&#147;incentive stock options

 nonqualified stock
options

We continue to review and evaluate
various restructuring and other alternatives to streamline our operations
improve efficiencies and reduce costs. Such initiatives may include selling
assets
 consolidating operations and functions and voluntary and involuntary
employee separation programs. Any such actions may require us to obtain the
pre-approval of our lenders under our credit facilities. In addition
 such
actions will subject the Company to additional short-term costs
 which may
include asset impairment charges
 lease commitment costs
 employee retention and
severance costs and other costs. Certain of these activities may have a
disproportionate impact on our income relative to the cost savings in a
particular period.

In connection with the Company's
      plan of reorganization
 the Company and the Founder Director entered into
      a consulting agreement
 which became effective on December 28

      terms of the consulting agreement included
 among other things
 that the
      Founder Director (i) provide services to the Company that are comparable
      in the aggregate with the services provided by him to the Company prior to
      December 28
 2009
 (ii) be appointed to the Board of Directors of the
      Company and during the term of the consulting agreement will be nominated
      for subsequent terms on the board
 (iii) be compensated for services
      rendered to the Company at a rate of $1.5 million per year for a term of
      five years
 (iv) be subject to customary non-solicitation and
      non-competition provisions and (v) be
 along with his spouse
 provided
      with medical benefits (or will be compensated for medical coverage) that
      are comparable in the aggregate to the medical benefits afforded to
      employees of the Company.

customary commercial terms and at a purchase price not to exceed approximately
$2.1 million. Consequently
 Mr. Lovette transferred all of the rights and the
Company assumed all obligations relative to the property for a purchase price of
$2.1 million. His home was sold on July 23
 2012.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES


We are a party to many routine
contracts in which we provide general indemnities in the normal course of
business to third parties for various risks. Among other considerations
 we have
not recorded a liability for any of these indemnities as based upon the
likelihood of payment
 the fair value of such indemnities would not have a
material impact on our financial condition
 results of operations and cash
flows. 

The Company will sometimes enter
into noncancelable contracts to purchase capital equipment and certain commodities such as corn
 soybean meal
 electricity and natural gas. At December
29
 2013
 the Company was party to outstanding purchase contracts totaling $150.6 million
 $4.8 million
 $4.7 million and $0.8 million payable in 2014
2015
 2016 and 2017
 respectively. 

The Consolidated Statements of
Operations include rental expense for operating leases of approximately $9.6
million
 $14.3 million and $26.2 million in 2013
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.
The Company&#146;s future minimum lease commitments under noncancelable operating
leases are as follows (in thousands):

Certain of the Company&#146;s operating
leases include rent escalations. The Company includes the rent escalation in its
minimum lease payments obligations and recognizes them as a component of rental
expense on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. 
The Company also maintains operating
leases for various types of equipment
 some of which contain residual value
guarantees for the market value of assets at the end of the term of the lease.
The terms of the lease maturities range from one to ten years. The maximum
potential amount of the residual value guarantees is estimated to be
approximately $2.6 million; however
 the actual amount would be offset by any
recoverable amount based on the fair market value of the underlying leased
assets. No liability has been recorded related to this contingency as the
likelihood of payments under these guarantees is not considered to be probable
and the fair value of such guarantees is immaterial. The Company historically
has not experienced significant payments under similar residual guarantees.

Financial Instruments

Pursuant
to the terms of the Subordinated Loan Agreement
 we have agreed to reimburse JBS
USA up to $56.5 million for draws upon any letters of credit issued for JBS
USA's account that support certain obligations of the Company and its
subsidiaries. 
The Company&#146;s loan agreements
generally obligate the Company to reimburse the applicable lender for
incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes (i) any reserve
or special deposit requirement against assets of
 deposits with or credit
extended by such lender related to the loan
 (ii) any tax
 duty or other charge
with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii) capital adequacy
requirements. In addition
 some of the Company&#146;s loan agreements contain a
withholding tax provision that requires the Company to pay additional amounts to
the applicable lender or other financing party
 generally if withholding taxes
are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in
the applicable tax law. These increased cost and withholding tax provisions
continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction
 and there is no
limitation on the maximum additional amounts the Company could be obligated to
pay under such provisions. Any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions
generally would trigger an event of default
 and
 in a secured financing
transaction
 would entitle the lender to foreclose upon the collateral to
realize the amount due. 

We are a party to many routine
contracts in which we provide general indemnities in the normal course of
business to third parties for various risks. Among other considerations
 we have
not recorded a liability for any of these indemnities as based upon the
likelihood of payment
 the fair value of such indemnities would not have a
material impact on our financial condition
 results of operations and cash
flows. 
The Company is subject to various
legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In
the Company&#146;s opinion
 it has made appropriate and adequate accruals for claims
where necessary; however
 the ultimate liability for these matters is uncertain
and if significantly different than the amounts accrued
 the ultimate outcome
could have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations
of the Company. For a discussion of the material legal proceedings and claims
see Part II
 Item 1. &#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148; Below is a summary of some of these
material proceedings and claims. The Company believes it has substantial
defenses to the claims made and intends to vigorously defend these cases.

On December 1
 2008
 Pilgrim&#146;s and
six of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas
Fort Worth Division (&#147;Bankruptcy Court&#148;). The cases were jointly administered
under Case No. 08-45664. The Company emerged from Chapter 11 on December 28
2009. The Company is the named defendant in several pre-petition lawsuits that
as of December 29
 2013
 have not been resolved. Among the claims presently
pending are claims brought against certain current and former directors
executive officers and employees of the Company
 the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride
Administrative Committee and the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Pension Committee seeking
unspecified damages under section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (&#147;ERISA&#148;)
 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132. These claims were brought by individual
participants in the Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Retirement Savings Plan
 individually and on
behalf of a putative class
 alleging that the defendants breached fiduciary
duties to plan participants and beneficiaries or otherwise violated ERISA.
Although the Company is not a named defendant in these claims
 our bylaws
require us to indemnify our current and former directors and officers from any
liabilities and expenses incurred by them in connection with actions they took
in good faith while serving as an officer or director. In these actions the
plaintiffs assert claims in excess of $35.0 million. The likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome or the amount or range of any possible loss to the Company
cannot be determined at this time. 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
Other
claims presently pending against the Company are claims seeking unspecified
damages brought by current or former contract chicken growers who allege
 along
with other assertions
 that the Company breached grower contracts and made false
representations to induce the plaintiffs into building chicken farms and
entering into chicken growing agreements with the Company. In the case styled
Shelia Adams
 et al. v. Pilgrim&#146;s Pride Corporation
 on September 30
 2011
 the
trial court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law stating that the
Company violated section 192(e) of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 by
purportedly attempting to manipulate the price of chicken by idling the El
Dorado
 Arkansas complex and rejecting the El Dorado growers&#146; contracts. The
trial court awarded damages in the amount of $25.8 million. Afterward
 the
Company filed post-judgment motions attacking the trial court&#146;s findings of fact
and conclusions of law
 which
 on December 28
 2011
 were granted in part and
resulted in a reduction of the damages award from $25.8 million to $25.6
million. On January 19
 2012
 the Company appealed the findings of fact and
conclusions of law and decision concerning the post-judgment motions to the
United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument occurred December 3
2012. On August 27
 2013
 the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment
 and entered a
judgment in favor of the Company. Plaintiffs thereafter filed a petition for
rehearing en banc. Plaintiffs&#146; petition for rehearing was denied on October 15
2013. On January 13
 2014
 Plaintiffs filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari
requesting the Supreme Court of the United States to accept their case for
review. The Company is awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether it
will accept the case for review. If such petition is granted
 the Company
intends to vigorously pursue its appellate rights and defend against
reinstatement of the underlying judgment of the trial court. The Fifth Circuit's
decision and prior favorable trial court rulings regarding the El Dorado grower'
claims suggest that the likelihood of any recovery by growers remaining in the
case is too remote to maintain the previously-recorded loss accrual. Therefore
the Company reversed the accrual on September 1
 2013. The remaining growers&#146;
claims were scheduled for trial during the summer and fall of 2012. Although the
trial associated with the growers&#146; claims from the Farmerville
 Louisiana
complex was completed without a ruling
 the trial associated with the growers&#146;
claims from the Nacogdoches
 Texas complex have not been completed and the trial
court has not scheduled a date for resuming the trial
 and the trials associated
with the growers&#146; claims from the De Queen and Batesville
 Arkansas complexes
have been indefinitely postponed by court order. The Company intends to
vigorously defend against these claims. Although the likelihood of financial
loss related to the remaining growers&#146; claims is reasonably possible
 an
estimate of potential loss cannot be determined at this time because of now
conflicting legal authority
 the factual nature of the various growers&#146;
individual claims and a new judge who will preside over the remaining bench
trials. There can be no assurances that other similar claims may not be brought
against the Company. 
The United States Department of
Treasury
 IRS filed an amended proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Court pursuant
to which the IRS asserted claims that total $74.7 million. We filed in the
Bankruptcy Court (i) an objection to the IRS&#146; amended proof of claim
 and (ii) a
motion requesting the Bankruptcy Court to determine our U.S. federal tax
liability pursuant to Sections 105 and 505 of the Bankruptcy Code. The objection
and motion asserted that the Company had no liability for the additional U.S.
federal taxes that have been asserted for pre-petition periods by the IRS. The
IRS responded in opposition to our objection and motion. On July 8
 2010
 the
Bankruptcy Court granted our unopposed motion requesting that the Bankruptcy
Court abstain from determining our federal tax liability. As a result we have
worked with the IRS through the normal processes and procedures that are
available to all taxpayers outside of bankruptcy (including the Tax Court
proceedings discussed below) to resolve the IRS&#146; amended proof of claim. On
December 13
 2012
 we entered into two Stipulations with the IRS. The first
Stipulation relates to the Company&#146;s 2003
 2005
 and 2007 tax years and resolves
all of the material issues in the case. The second Stipulation relates to the
Company as the successor in interest to Gold Kist for the tax years ended June
30
 2005 and September 30
 2005
 and resolves all substantive issues in the
case. These Stipulations account for approximately $29.3 million of the amended
proof of claim and should result in no additional tax due. 
In connection with the amended proof
of claim
 on May 26
 2010
 we filed a petition in Tax Court in response to a
Notice of Deficiency that was issued to the Company as the successor in interest
to Gold Kist. The Notice of Deficiency and the Tax Court proceeding relate to a
loss that Gold Kist claimed for its tax year ended June 30
 2004. On December
11
 2013
 the Tax Court issued its opinion in the Tax Court Case holding the
loss that Gold Kist claimed for its tax year ended June 30
 2004 is capital in
nature. On January 10
 2014
 PPC filed both a Motion for Reconsideration and a
Motion for Full Tax Court review of both its Motion for Reconsideration and any
order issued in response to such motion. On January 15
 2014
 the Tax Court
issued an order requesting the IRS to respond to PPC&#146;s Motion for
Reconsideration on or before February 18
 2014. The Company intends to
vigorously pursue its appellate rights. This proceeding accounts for
approximately $45.4 million of the amended proof of claim. 
Upon the initial filing of the Gold
Kist tax return for the year ended June 30
 2004
 the Company assessed the
likelihood that the position related to the proceeding would be sustained upon
examination and determined that it met the recognition threshold and the full
amount of benefit was recognized. We continue to believe the position is more
likely than not of being sustained. If adversely determined
 the outcome could
have a material effect on the Company&#146;s operating results and financial
position. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (&#147;ICE&#148;) investigated allegations of identity theft within our
workforce. With our cooperation
 ICE arrested approximately 350 of our employees
in 2008 believed to have engaged in identity theft at five of our facilities. On
December 30
 2009
 PPC
 the U.S. Attorney&#146;s Office for the Eastern District of
Texas
 and the Dallas Office of ICE entered into a non-prosecution agreement and
civil resolution of the government&#146;s investigation. Under this agreement: (i)
the government agreed not to proceed either criminally or civilly against PPC
and to end its investigation of the immigration-related matters
 relating to
both the company and its current and former officers
 employees and directors;
(ii) PPC agreed to an immigration compliance program that would remain in effect
for at least the 5-year term of the agreement; and (iii) PPC will pay an
aggregate of $4.5 million
 which approximates the amount the Company had
previously accrued for this matter
 to the government in four annual
installments. We paid the first three installments of $1.1 million in 2010
 2011
and 2012. We also paid the final installment in 2013. The parties acknowledged
that PPC was admitting to no civil liability or criminal culpability as a result
of the settlement. However
 no assurances can be given that further enforcement
efforts by governmental authorities against our employees or the Company (i)
will not disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations at one or more of
our facilities
 thereby negatively impacting our business or (ii) result in the
assessment of fines against us that could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position
 results of operations or cash flows. 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 
MARKET RISKS AND CONCENTRATIONS

The
Company&#146;s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of cash equivalents
 investment securities and trade
accounts receivable. The Company&#146;s cash equivalents and investment securities
are high-quality debt and equity securities placed with major banks and
financial institutions. The Company&#146;s trade accounts receivable are generally
unsecured. Credit evaluations are performed on all significant customers and
updated as circumstances dictate. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to
trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and
their dispersion across geographic areas. With the exception of one customer
that accounts for approximately 13.0% of trade accounts and other receivables at
December 29
 2013
 and approximately 9.7% of net sales for 2013
 the Company
does not believe it has significant concentrations of credit risk in its trade
accounts receivable. 
At December 29
 2013
 approximately
35.3% of the Company&#146;s employees were covered under collective bargaining
agreements. Substantially all employees covered under collective bargaining
with the exception of one live
operations location where the collective bargaining agreement expired in 2013
and negotiations are ongoing. We have not experienced any labor-related work
 years. We believe our relationship with our employees and
union leadership is satisfactory. The Company is
 one location
 and there is no assurance that agreement will
be reached. In the absence of an agreement
 we may become subject to labor
disruption at this location
 which could have an adverse effect on our financial
results. 
The aggregate carrying amount of net
assets belonging to our Mexico operations was $359.0 million and $277.0 million
at December 29
 2013 and December 30
 2012
 respectively. 
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC
REPORTING 
We operate in one reportable
business segment
 as a producer and seller of chicken products we either produce
or purchase for resale in the U.S.
 Puerto Rico and Mexico. We conduct separate
operations in the U.S.
 Puerto Rico and Mexico; however
 for geographic
reporting purposes
 we include Puerto Rico with our U.S. operations. Corporate
expenses are allocated to Mexico based upon various apportionment methods for
specific expenditures incurred related thereto with the remaining amounts
allocated to the U.S. 
During 2011
 we announced
organizational changes that resulted in the merger of our former Other Products
segment into our Chicken segment. Data related to our former Other Products
segment
 which included primarily non-chicken products sold through our
distribution centers
 table eggs
 animal feed and offal
 is no longer reported
directly to the chief operating decision maker. This information is now reported
through chicken operations management. We reclassified prior year segment

Changes in and
Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

As disclosed
in the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on March 14
 2012
 the Company changed its independent
registered public accountants effective March 14
 2012. 
Controls and
Procedures 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 2013
 an evaluation was performed under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company&#146;s management
 including
the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
 of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#146;s &#147;disclosure controls
and procedures&#148; (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;)). Based on that evaluation
the Company&#146;s management
 including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer
 concluded the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded
processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms
 and that information we are
required to disclose in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our
Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
 as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 the Company&#146;s
management
 including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer
 identified no changes in the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the Company&#146;s quarter ended December 29
 2013
and that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. 



MANAGEMENT&#146;S REPORT ON INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
Pilgrim's
Pride Corporation's (&#147;PPC&#148;) management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). PPC's internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 including
its principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 PPC's management
assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 29
 2013 based on the framework set forth in
Internal Control-Integrated
 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 management concluded that PPC's internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 29
 2013. KPMG
LLP
 an independent registered public accounting firm
 has issued a report on
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as
of December 29
 2013. That report is included in this annual report. 



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Board of Directors and Stockholders

We have
audited Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's internal control over financial reporting
as of December 29
 2013
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion
 Pilgrim's Pride Corporation maintained
 in all material
respects
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29
2013
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. 
We also have audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
 the consolidated balance
sheets of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation as of December 29
 2013 and December 30
2012
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 comprehensive
income (loss)
 stockholders' equity
 and cash flows for the fifty-two weeks
ended December 29
 2013 and the fifty-three weeks ended December 30
 2012
 and
our report dated February 21
 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

 individually and on behalf of a putative class
 alleging that the defendants breached fiduciary duties to plan participants and beneficiaries or otherwise violated ERISA. Although the Company is not a named defendant in these claims
 our bylaws require us to indemnify our current and former directors and officers from any liabilities and expenses incurred by them in connection with actions they took in good faith while serving as an officer or director. In these actions the plaintiffs assert claims in excess of $35.0 million. The likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the amount or range of any possible loss to the Company cannot be determined at this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=text-align: justify&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font style=font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 80%&gt;Other claims presently pending against the Company are claims seeking unspecified damages brought by current or former contract chicken growers who allege
 along with other assertions
 that the Company breached grower contracts and made false representations to induce the plaintiffs into building chicken farms and entering into chicken growing agreements with the Company. In the case styled Shelia Adams
 et al. v. Pilgrim&amp;#39;s Pride Corporation
 on September 30
 2011
 the trial court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law stating that the Company violated section 192(e) of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 by purportedly attempting to manipulate the price of chicken by idling the El Dorado
 Arkansas complex and rejecting the El Dorado growers&amp;#39; contracts. The trial court awarded damages in the amount of $25.8 million. Afterward
 the Company filed post-judgment motions attacking the trial court&amp;#39;s findings of fact and conclusions of law
 which
 on December 28
 2011
 were granted in part and resulted in a reduction of the damages award from $25.8 million to $25.6 million. On January 19
 2012
 the Company appealed the findings of fact and conclusions of law and decision concerning the post-judgment motions to the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument occurred December 3
 2012. On August 27
 2013
 the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment
 and entered a judgment in favor of the Company. Plaintiffs thereafter filed a petition for rehearing en banc. Plaintiffs&amp;#39; petition for rehearing was denied on October 15
 2013. On January 13
 2014
 Plaintiffs filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari requesting the Supreme Court of the United States to accept their case for review. The Company is awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether it will accept the case for review. If such petition is granted
 the Company intends to vigorously pursue its appellate rights and defend against reinstatement of the underlying judgment of the trial court. The Fifth Circuit&amp;#39;s decision and prior favorable trial court rulings regarding the El Dorado grower&amp;#39; claims suggest that the likelihood of any recovery by growers remaining in the case is too remote to maintain the previously-recorded loss accrual. Therefore
 the Company reversed the accrual on September 1
 2013. The remaining growers&amp;#39; claims were scheduled for trial during the summer and fall of 2012. Although the trial associated with the growers&amp;#39; claims from the Farmerville
 Louisiana complex was completed without a ruling
 the trial associated with the growers&amp;#39; claims from the Nacogdoches
 Texas complex have not been completed and the trial court has not scheduled a date for resuming the trial
 and the trials associated with the growers&amp;#39; claims from the De Queen and Batesville
 Arkansas complexes have been indefinitely postponed by court order. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims. Although the likelihood of financial loss related to the remaining growers&amp;#39; claims is reasonably possible
 an estimate of potential loss cannot be determined at this time because of now conflicting legal authority

 IRS filed an amended proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to which the IRS asserted claims that total $74.7 million. We filed in the Bankruptcy Court (i) an objection to the IRS&amp;#39; amended proof of claim
 and (ii) a motion requesting the Bankruptcy Court to determine our U.S. federal tax liability pursuant to Sections 105 and 505 of the Bankruptcy Code. The objection and motion asserted that the Company had no liability for the additional U.S. federal taxes that have been asserted for pre-petition periods by the IRS. The IRS responded in opposition to our objection and motion. On July 8
 2010
 the Bankruptcy Court granted our unopposed motion requesting that the Bankruptcy Court abstain from determining our federal tax liability. As a result we have worked with the IRS through the normal processes and procedures that are available to all taxpayers outside of bankruptcy (including the Tax Court proceedings discussed below) to resolve the IRS&amp;#39; amended proof of claim. On December 13
 2012
 we entered into two Stipulations with the IRS. The first Stipulation relates to the Company&amp;#39;s 2003
 2005
 and 2007 tax years and resolves all of the material issues in the case. The second Stipulation relates to the Company as the successor in interest to Gold Kist for the tax years ended June 30
 2005 and September 30
 2005

 on May 26
 2010
 we filed a petition in Tax Court in response to a Notice of Deficiency that was issued to the Company as the successor in interest to Gold Kist. The Notice of Deficiency and the Tax Court proceeding relate to a loss that Gold Kist claimed for its tax year ended June 30
 2004. On December 11
 2013
 the Tax Court issued its opinion in the Tax Court Case holding the loss that Gold Kist claimed for its tax year ended June 30
 2004 is capital in nature. On January 10
 2014
 PPC filed both a Motion for Reconsideration and a Motion for Full Tax Court review of both its Motion for Reconsideration and any order issued in response to such motion. On January 15
 2014
 the Tax Court issued an order requesting the IRS to respond to PPC&amp;#39;s Motion for Reconsideration on or before February 18

 2004
 the Company assessed the likelihood that the position related to the proceeding would be sustained upon examination and determined that it met the recognition threshold and the full amount of benefit was recognized. We continue to believe the position is more likely than not of being sustained. If adversely determined

 ICE arrested approximately 350 of our employees in 2008 believed to have engaged in identity theft at five of our facilities. On December 30
 2009
 PPC
 the U.S. Attorney&amp;#39;s Office for the Eastern District of Texas
 and the Dallas Office of ICE entered into a non-prosecution agreement and civil resolution of the government&amp;#39;s investigation. Under this agreement: (i) the government agreed not to proceed either criminally or civilly against PPC
 and to end its investigation of the immigration-related matters
 relating to both the company and its current and former officers
 employees and directors; (ii) PPC agreed to an immigration compliance program that would remain in effect for at least the 5-year term of the agreement; and (iii) PPC will pay an aggregate of $4.5 million
 which approximates the amount the Company had previously accrued for this matter
 to the government in four annual installments. We paid the first three installments of $1.1 million in 2010
 2011 and 2012. We also paid the final installment in 2013. The parties acknowledged that PPC was admitting to no civil liability or criminal culpability as a result of the settlement. However
 no assurances can be given that further enforcement efforts by governmental authorities against our employees or the Company (i) will not disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations at one or more of our facilities
 thereby negatively impacting our business or (ii) result in the assessment of fines against us that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position


 investigations and other claims related to employment
 environmental
 product and other matters. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes
 as well as potential ranges of probable losses
 to these matters. The Company estimates the amount of reserves required for these contingencies when losses are determined to be probable and after considerable analysis of each individual issue. The Company expenses legal costs related to such loss contingencies as they are incurred. The accrual for environmental remediation liabilities is measured on an undiscounted basis. These reserves may change in the future due to changes in the Company&amp;#39;s assumptions

 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carry back and carry forward periods)

 the Company believes it has sufficient positive evidence to conclude that realization of its federal and state net deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realized. The decrease in valuation allowance of $178.0 million during 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in federal
 state and foreign net operating losses. As of December 29
 2013
 the Company&amp;#39;s valuation allowance is $10.4 million

 2013
 the Company had state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $459.6 million that will begin to expire in 2014. The Company also had Mexico net operating loss carry forwards at December 29

 2013

 2009
 H.R. 3548 was signed into law and included a provision that allowed most business taxpayers an increased carry back period for net operating losses incurred in 2008 or 2009. As a result

 as amended (the IRC)
 imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its U.S. net operating losses and tax credits to reduce its tax liability. The Company experienced an ownership change in December 2009

 2013 based upon the determination that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise if these earnings were to be remitted. For activity after 2008
 the Company is not permanently reinvesting its earnings in Puerto Rico. Therefore

 the Company completed its deconsolidation of its Mexico operations from a tax perspective to help minimize the impact of the Mexico tax reform that became effective January 1
 2010. As a result
 all of the Mexico subsidiaries started filing separate returns in 2011. The deconsolidation reduced the accrued taxes that had been previously recognized under the consolidated filing status as it eliminated recapturing certain taxes required under the new consolidation laws. As a result of the deconsolidation
 the Company recognized a benefit of $4.3 million and $29.5 million during 2011 and 2010
 respectively
 which reduced the additional taxes that had been previously accrued as of December 27
 2009

 Gold Kist began to substantially curtail its programs for active employees. On July 1

 exclusive of assets held for sale
 with the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of its long-lived assets held for use. The Company determined that the carrying amount of its long-lived assets held for use is recoverable over the remaining life of the primary asset in the group

 plant and equipment are stated at cost
 and repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets. Estimated useful lives for building

 the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. In making these determinations
 the Company utilizes certain assumptions
 including
 but not limited to: (i) future cash flows estimated to be generated by these assets
 which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization
 remaining length of service and estimated salvage values
 (ii) estimated fair market value of the assets and (iii) determinations with respect to the lowest level of cash flows relevant to the respective impairment test

 which operate as a vertically integrated network
 and the fact that the Company does not price the transfers of inventory between its vertically integrated facilities at market prices
 it evaluates impairment of assets held for use at the country level (i.e.
 the U.S. and Mexico). Management believes this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for its assets that are held for use in production activities. At the present time
 the Company&amp;#39;s forecasts indicate that it can recover the carrying value of its assets held for use based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the operations. A key assumption in management&amp;#39;s forecast is that the Company&amp;#39;s sales volumes will return to historical margins as supply and demand between commodities and chicken and other animal-based proteins become more balanced. However
 the exact timing of the return to historical margins is not certain
 and if the return to historical margins is delayed

 amounts included in counteroffers initiated by the Company
 or
 in the absence of current contract negotiations
 amounts determined using a sales comparison approach for real property and amounts determined using a cost approach for personal property. Under the sales comparison approach
 sales and asking prices of reasonably comparable properties are considered to develop a range of unit prices within which the current real estate market is operating. Under the cost approach
 a current cost to replace the asset new is calculated and then the estimated replacement cost is reduced to reflect the applicable decline in value resulting from physical deterioration
 functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence. Appropriate selling costs includes reasonable broker&amp;#39;s commissions
 costs to produce title documents
 filing fees

 Pilgrim&amp;#39;s commenced the Rights Offering for stockholders of record as of January 17
 2012 (the Record Date). The basic subscription privilege gave stockholders the option to purchase 0.2072 shares of Pilgrim&amp;#39;s common stock
 rounded up to the next largest whole number
 at a subscription price of $4.50 per share for each share of Pilgrim&amp;#39;s common stock they owned as of the Record Date. The multiplier was determined by dividing the 44
444
444 shares being offered in the Rights Offering by the total number of shares owned by all stockholders on the Record Date. Those stockholders that exercised their basic subscription privilege in full also received an over-subscription privilege that afforded them the opportunity to purchase additional shares at the subscription price of $4.50 per share from a pool of the shares left over had all stockholders not elected to exercise their basic subscription privileges in full. JBS USA committed to participate in the Rights Offering and exercise its basic and over-subscription privileges in full. The last day a stockholder could exercise either their basic subscription rights or their over-subscription rights was February 29
 2012. On March 7
 2012
 the Company issued 44

 represents the net amount of deferred tax assets (after reduction for valuation allowance) and liabilities as of the balance sheet date
 which result from applying the applicable enacted tax rate to net temporary differences and carry forwards pertaining to assets or liabilities that are classified as current in the financial statements
 or that are expected to reverse in the next twelve months (or normal operating cycle
 if longer). A temporary difference is a difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that will reverse in ensuing periods. In a classified statement of financial position
 an enterprise separates deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and a noncurrent amount. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting. A deferred tax liability or asset that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting
