PART
I

Item
1. Business



NutraLife
BioSciences
 Inc.
 a Florida corporation (&ldquo;us
&rdquo; &ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;our&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was founded
in 2010 by Edgar Ward
 the Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer
 President &amp; sole Director to engage in the development
 manufacturing
and distribution of nutritional and dietary oral spray products. Since then
 the Company has evolved into a branded and private label
developer
 manufacturer and distributor of a wide range of nutraceutical
 wellness
 and CBD products.

Amid
the COVID-19 global pandemic
 in 2020
 the Company made a strategic pivot from our then-current nutraceutical manufacturing business
by adding the manufacture of consumer sanitizer products utilizing the Company&rsquo;s existing manufacturing capabilities and the Company&rsquo;s
ability to retrofit its operations and accommodate production due to the shortage of supply and increased demand for sanitizer products.

The
Company&rsquo;s manufacturing facility has been registered with the Food and Drug Administration and its manufacturing facility has operated
in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Processes Standard (GMP) for more than five years. Our products adhere to high manufacturing
standards throughout every step of the manufacturing and extraction process. Our products are formulated
 developed
 manufactured and
produced under the supervision of Edgar Ward
 our Chief Executive Officer
 President and sole Director. Once produced
 our products are
tested by our in-house laboratory chemists. We believe that our nutraceutical and industrial CBD products are of the highest-quality
and are laboratory tested for strength
 purity and contaminants such as heavy metals
 pesticides
 and solvents.

We
offer 13 different core formulations which we modify to meet the specifications of our private label customers. We provide approximately
50 different variations of our core formulations. Our private label products include CBD-infused oral sprays
 tinctures
 pet drops
 pain
balms
 and face creams
 and nutraceutical oral spray products for sleep support and weight loss packaged under the customer&rsquo;s brand
names.

Our
spray products and tinctures are available in various formulations and strengths and are available for purchase online directly from
the Company through its website at 
 as well as through numerous other private label distributors
online retailers and retail outlets. Information available on
 or accessible through the foregoing website is not a part of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated herein by reference.

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We sustained a net loss of approximately $2.9 and $4.0 million for
the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 respectively
 negative cash flows from operations for both years and had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $41.7 million at December 31
 2020. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. The independent auditors&rsquo; report on our financial statements for the years ended December 31
 2020 and
2019 contain explanatory paragraphs expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

In
December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in China and spread to the U.S. in early 2020. The spread
of this virus caused various business disruptions including temporary closures to the Company&rsquo;s offices and facilities. While these
disruptions are currently expected to be temporary
 there is considerable uncertainty around the duration. Therefore
 the Company expects
this matter to negatively impact its operating results. The related financial impact and duration cannot be reasonably estimated at this
time.

The
Company is currently in the process of raising capital to complete and finalize the build-out of its facility in Deerfield Beach for
the purpose of consolidating its operations. The structure of the capital raise is currently in-development. The Company is seeking to
continue its path to profitability through increased business development
 marketing and sales of the Company&rsquo;s multiple lines
of topical
 ingestible and skincare health and wellness products. The Company is also focused on completing an efficacy clinical study
on its patented mosquito bug patch with plans upon a successful conclusion to launch globally in the very near future
 adding to the
Company&rsquo;s suite of wellness products. However
 there can be no assurance that the foregoing can occur as planned
 or at all.


    
    


Failure
to successfully continue to grow operational revenues could harm our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. We face all of the risks inherent in a new business
 including the need for significant additional capital
 management&rsquo;s
potential underestimation of initial and ongoing costs
 and potential delays and other problems in connection with establishing sales
channels.

We
are continuing our plan to further grow and expand operations and seek sources of capital to pay our contractual obligations as they
come due. Management believes that its current operating strategy will provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern
as long as we are able to obtain additional financing; however
 there is no assurance this will occur. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

Corporate
History


company in the state of Florida on April 1
 2010. On December 3

 a Florida corporation (&ldquo;TransDermal&rdquo;) formed on February 8
 2019.


Smaller
Reporting Company

The
Company is a &ldquo;smaller reporting company&rdquo; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available
to us as a smaller reporting company
 including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of
audited financial statements
 instead of three years. As long as we maintain our status as a &ldquo;smaller reporting company
&rdquo;
these exemptions will continue to be available to us.

Bankruptcy
Receivership or Similar Proceedings

We
have not been involved in a bankruptcy receivership or similar proceeding. Additionally
 we have not been involved in a reclassification
merger
 consolidation
 or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.

Our
Business

We
are a manufacturer and distributor of nutraceutical
 dietary
 wellness and other products
 such as sanitizer products. Our products are
sold to private label distributors who sell the products we manufacture under their own brand names as well as under our own brand names.
We generate revenues from the sales of our products.



 2020 and 2019
we generated revenues of $1
255
784 and $2
133
624
 respectively
 from the sale of our products.


In
March 2017
 we began selling CBD products. For the years ending on December 31
 2020 and 2019
 we generated revenues of $66
807 and
$1
800
000
 respectively
 from the sale of our CBD products
 representing 5.65% and 100% of our revenues for such periods.

Our
Products and Services

We
manufacture and distribute private label and branded products. In both of the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 private
label sales represented 99% of our revenue.


    
    


Our
Products

Our
CBD products are derived from the seeds and mature stalks of the Cannabis Sativa plant which includes all parts and varieties of the
cannabis sativa plant also known as hemp
 which contain a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (&ldquo;THC&rdquo;) that does not exceed
0.3 percent on a dry-weight basis. In December of 2018
 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration completed an evaluation of three generally
recognized as safe (GRAS) notices for hemp seed-derived food ingredients. The FDA stated that hulled hemp seed (GRN765)
 hemp seed protein
powder (GRN771)
 and hemp seed oil (GRN778) are GRAS under their intended conditions of use.

Our
CBD products are made from seeds and mature stalks of hemp and contain only trace amounts of THC which are far below 0.3 percent
 and
we believe they qualify as GRAS products.

Our
CBD products include:



    
    
Cannabinoid-rich
    hemp oil derived from industrial hemp;

    
    
    

    
    
Topical
    lotions and oils applied directly to the skin designed to treat pain or inflammation;

    
    
Face
    creams;

    
    
Massage
    oils;

    
    
Nutraceutical
    Sprays with CBD as an added ingredient; and

    
    
Pet
    products taken internally.


Our
other products include:



    
    
Eddie&rsquo;s
    Clean Hands

    
    
Eddie&rsquo;s
    Immune Boost

Amid
the COVID-19 global pandemic
 in 2020
 the Company made a strategic pivot from our then-current nutraceutical manufacturing business
by adding the manufacture of consumer sanitizer products utilizing the Company&rsquo;s existing manufacturing capabilities and the Company&rsquo;s
ability to retrofit its operations and accommodate production due to the shortage of supply and demand for sanitizer products. To do
so
 consistent with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements
 the Company registered and obtained a labeler code as an over-the-counter
(OTC) manufacturing facility and began manufacturing and distributing a line of liquid-based multi-use sanitizer spray products under
the Company&rsquo;s in-house brand
 &ldquo;Eddie&rsquo;s Clean Hands
&rdquo; packaged as a multi-use sanitizer spray
 formulated per
the CDC&rsquo;s recommendation of containing at least 60-95% ethanol or isopropanol alcohol to be effective.

In
May 2020
 we secured a supplier agreement with Grainger
 and began drop-shipping its sanitizer products that include a 10-pack of Eddie&rsquo;s
Clean Hands 2 oz. sanitizer spray along with a larger 8 oz. sanitizer spray directly to Grainger and its customers. Grainger is a broad
line
 business-to-business distributor of maintenance
 repair
 and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in
North America
 Japan
 and Europe.

On
September 30
 2020
 the Company filed Articles of Amendment (the &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo;) to its Articles of Incorporation with the Florida
Department of State that contained a Certificate of Designations to designate one hundred and ten (110) shares of the preferred stock
of the Company
 par value $0.0001 as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the &ldquo;Series B Preferred Stock&rdquo;). The Amendment
was effective on September 30
 2020.

On
November 2
 2020
 the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Lord Global Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary
 27
Health Inc.
 and also entered into a Manufacturing
 Distribution and Sales Agreement (the &ldquo;MDS&rdquo;) with 27 Health Inc. The
MDS is a multi-year production
 fulfillment
 and distribution agreement with 27 Health Inc. to launch its patent-pending Oral Sanitizer
mouth spray which we hope will provide some protection from viruses by reducing viral transmission. The foregoing agreements are further
described under the heading &ldquo;Material Agreements&rdquo; below.

On
December 18
 2020
 the Company received its product registration number from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and completed its
first production run of Oral Shield antiseptic protection mouth spray. The Company along with its partners plans to market and distribute
the product on a global scale and seeks to provide a convenient
 travel-size
 quality
 multi-functioning antiseptic mouth spray for consumers
to use throughout the day. We believe that mouthwash products can be effective at killing viruses
 reducing the viral load within the
mouth essentially supporting the reduction of virus transmissions.

Our
Operating Strategy

As
noted above
 in 2020
 the Company made a strategic pivot from our then-current nutraceutical manufacturing business by adding the manufacture
of consumer sanitizer products utilizing the Company&rsquo;s existing manufacturing capabilities and the Company&rsquo;s ability to retrofit
its operations and accommodate production due to the shortage of supply and demand for sanitizer products. To do so
 consistent with
Food and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;) requirements
 the Company registered and obtained a labeler code as an over-the-counter
(OTC) manufacturing facility and began manufacturing and distributing a line of liquid-based multi-use sanitizer spray products under
the Company&rsquo;s in-house brand
 &ldquo;Eddie&rsquo;s Clean Hands
&rdquo; packaged as a multi-use sanitizer spray
 formulated per
the CDC&rsquo;s recommendation of containing at least 60-95% ethanol or isopropanol alcohol to be effective. We plan to continue manufacturing
and distributing liquid-based multi-use sanitizer spray products under the Company&rsquo;s in-house brand
 &ldquo;Eddie&rsquo;s Clean
Hands.&rdquo;

Also
as discussed above
 on December 18
 2020
 the Company received its product registration number from the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and completed its first production run of Oral Shield antiseptic protection mouth spray. The Company along with its partners plans
to market and distribute the product on a global scale and seeks to provide a convenient
 travel-size
 quality
 multi-functioning antiseptic
mouth spray for consumers to use throughout the day. We believe that mouthwash products can be effective at killing viruses
 reducing
the viral load within the mouth essentially supporting the reduction of virus transmissions.


    
    


We
also plan to continue the development
 manufacturing and distribution of nutritional and dietary oral spray products and we believe a
number of current industry trends will increase demand for private label products particularly in the industrial hemp CBD market. Our
operating strategy for such products consists of the following key elements:



    
    
We
    purchase raw materials and produce goods only upon receipt of a firm commitment from our private label customers and we require payment
    in full prior to shipping. Once a product is shipped to a customer
 we generally do not accept returns unless the product is defective
    or delivered late. These practices minimize our need to carry unsold inventories.

    
    
We
    regularly update our product line to keep up with consumer trends and industry developments.

    
    
We
    provide superior customer service by controlling the entire production process of our products. By controlling the production process
    we have the ability to tailor products to a customer&rsquo;s specific needs
 offer customers rapid order turnaround time
 maintain
    flexible scheduling and maintain higher standards of quality control.

    
    
We
    seek to add value to customers&rsquo; overall merchandising effort. We work closely with our customers to develop distinctive product
    lines at their particular price points. We believe that this process allows our customers to achieve a degree of differentiation
    from their retail competitors. We believe our ability to develop
 manufacture and offer high quality
 all-natural products is a competitive
    advantage and will lead to increased orders.

    
    
We
    emphasize the development of long-term relationships with our customers by providing a high level of customer service through our
    sales force. We seek to capitalize on our knowledgeable and experienced sales force by maintaining regular interaction with our customers
    which provides us with an understanding of which products will meet their particular needs.


Our
Growth Strategy

We
intend to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:



    
    
We
    plan to continue to expand our manufacture of consumer sanitizer products.

    
    
We
    plan to continue manufacturing and distributing liquid-based multi-use sanitizer spray products under the Company&rsquo;s in-house
    brand
 &ldquo;Eddie&rsquo;s Clean Hands&rdquo;.

    
    
We
    also plan to continue to brand ourselves as a High Quality GMP Compliant manufacturer of industrial hemp CBD products. Many manufacturers
    of CBD based products do not operate in compliance with GMP standards. All of our CBD products are tested at multiple stages of the
    production process to ensure product quality and a THC content of less than 0.3%.

    
    
We
    will seek to increase sales to our existing customers by expanding sales of additional products. Certain of our customers began their
    relationship with us by purchasing only one of our products. Since these initial purchases
 we have been able to expand our sales
    to such customers to multiple products. This strategy has enabled us to expand our product sales to our existing customers over time.
    We aggressively pursue these cross-selling opportunities. Our range of products enables us to pursue many of these cross-selling
    opportunities.

    
    
We
    seek to increase sales to customers by offering products in categories outside of our traditional product offerings.

    
    
We
    plan to leverage our sales
 reputation for quality all-natural products to expand our customer base to other private label customers
    within the industrial hemp CBD and Nutraceutical markets.


Our
Customers

Our
customers for our consumer sanitizer products include Grainger
 Riverhead Chamber of Commerce and ecommerce direct to consumer consumers.


    
    


Our
private label sales represent 7 different brands of products manufactured by us. Sales to private label customers represented approximately
99% and 99% of our revenues for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 respectively. Our industrial hemp CBD products represented
100% and 100% of private label sales in the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 respectively.

We
do not enter into long term contracts with our private label distributors and all sales are made by purchase order. Our private label
customers are not obligated to order a minimum amount of product from us and can discontinue purchasing our product at any time.

We
believe our private label products offer numerous benefits to our customers:



    
    
Our
    private label products as less expensive than brand name products
 but of equal or better quality.

    
    
Our
    private label products offer the opportunity for higher profit margins than brand name products.

    
    
Distributing
    private label products builds brand recognition for the retail as well as the wholesale customer.

    
    
We
    are registered with the FDA and follow GMP in the manufacturing process ensuring high quality products and consistent standards for
    our private label customers.

    
    
Businesses
    using our private label products avoid the additional expense of manufacturing and creating the finished product.

    
    
Our
    private label customers are able to focus their attention and resources on their business and not on manufacturing a final product.

    
    
We
    believe that we offer high quality unique products with enhanced delivery systems that are effective and appealing to consumers.

    
    
We
    offer a wide range of private label products providing our customers with a variety of options.

    
    
Private
    label customers have the convenience of ordering our products online.




As
noted above
 in 2020
 the Company made a strategic pivot from our then-current nutraceutical manufacturing business by adding the manufacture
of consumer sanitizer products utilizing the Company&rsquo;s existing manufacturing capabilities and the Company&rsquo;s ability to retrofit
its operations and accommodate production due to the shortage of supply and demand for sanitizer products. To do so
 consistent with
FDA requirements
 the Company registered and obtained a labeler code as an OTC manufacturing
facility and began manufacturing and distributing a line of liquid-based multi-use sanitizer spray products under the Company&rsquo;s
in-house brand
 &ldquo;Eddie&rsquo;s Clean Hands
&rdquo; packaged as a multi-use sanitizer spray
 formulated per the CDC&rsquo;s recommendation
of containing at least 60-95% ethanol or isopropanol alcohol to be effective. We plan to continue manufacturing and distributing liquid-based
multi-use sanitizer spray products under the Company&rsquo;s in-house brand
 &ldquo;Eddie&rsquo;s Clean Hands&rdquo;.

Also
as discussed above
 on December 18
 2020
 the Company received its product registration number from the FDA and completed its first production run of Oral Shield antiseptic protection mouth spray. The Company along with its partners plans
to market and distribute the product on a global scale and seeks to provide a convenient
 travel-size
 quality
 multi-functioning antiseptic
mouth spray for consumers to use throughout the day. We believe that mouthwash products can be effective at killing viruses
 reducing
the viral load within the mouth essentially supporting the reduction of virus transmissions.

Once
developed
 our products are manufactured at our facility in Coconut Creek
 Florida. We obtain all raw materials and ingredients for our
products from third party suppliers. For all orders we receive
 we manufacture
 package
 label and ship the product to the customer.
We lease an aggregate of six thousand four hundred (6
400) square feet of office and warehouse space at 6601 Lyons Rd
 Suites L-6&amp;7
Coconut Creek
 Florida 33073. Approximately five thousand eight hundred (5
800) square feet at this location is used for manufacturing
storage and distribution of our products.

On
June 6
 2017
 we entered into an agreement to lease nineteen thousand eight hundred and thirty-one (19
831) square feet in Deerfield
Beach
 FL 33441. We plan to use seventeen thousand eight hundred (17
800) square feet of the new Deerfield Beach location for manufacturing
storage and distribution of our products. We expect to begin manufacturing at this location in August of 2021.


    
    


By
manufacturing our own products
 we believe that we maintain better control over product quality and availability while also reducing
production costs. Our manufacturing process generally consists of the following operations: (a) sourcing ingredients for products
 (b)
warehousing raw ingredients
 (c) efficacy testing and measuring ingredients for inclusion in products
 and (d) blending using automatic
equipment. The next step
 bottling and packaging
 involves filling
 capping
 coding
 labeling and placing the product in packaging with
appropriate tamper-evident features then sending the packaged product to our customers.

The
FDA requires companies manufacturing homeopathic medicines
to have their facilities certified as Good Manufacturing Practices (&ldquo;GMPs&rdquo;). Our manufacturing facility is registered with
the FDA and is compliant with its GMP certification. Our quality control program seeks to ensure the superior quality of our products
and that they are manufactured in accordance with current GMP. Our processing methods are monitored closely to ensure that only quality
ingredients are used and to ensure product purity. Periodically
 we retain the services of outside GMP audit firms to assist us in our
efforts to comply with GMPs.

Sources
and Availability of Raw Materials

The
raw materials for our industrial hemp CBD products consist of Cannabidiol rich oil and isolate. We obtain the raw materials for our industrial
hemp CBD products from state licensed suppliers. We obtain the raw materials for our other non-CBD based products from several ingredient
suppliers located in the U.S. These raw materials consist of naturally derived vitamins and nutrients. The raw materials used by us are
available from a variety of suppliers. We maintain a good relationship with our suppliers and do not anticipate that any of our suppliers
will terminate their relationship with us in the near term. We have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. In the
event
 we are unable to obtain any of our raw materials from our suppliers; we believe that we could obtain alternative sources of any
raw materials from other suppliers. We do not have contracts with our suppliers and we order our raw materials on an as needed basis.
We have not experienced any material adverse effects on our business as a result of shortages of raw materials or packaging materials
used in the manufacturing of our products. An unexpected interruption or a shortage in supply of raw materials could adversely affect
our business derived from these products.

Shipping
and Delivery of Finished Products

Upon
completion of the manufacturing process
 our products are shipped directly to customers. Private label products are packaged by us in
the packaging provided by each customer. All shipping
 bills of lading and invoices are generated by us from our Coconut Creek
 Florida
facility.

We
ship the product ordered within forty-five (45) days to our private label distributors
 thirty (30) days to retail customers and within
thirty (30) days to wholesale and third party (non-private label) distributors. All orders are shipped by freight delivery at the cost
of the customer. We require a deposit of fifty percent (50%) upon an order being placed from our private label customers and the balance
prior to shipping. Our retail customers must pay for their order at the time that the order is placed.

Product
Development &amp; Quality

We
have in place comprehensive quality control procedures seeking to ensure that raw materials and finished goods meet our exacting quality
standards. Each product we offer is based upon the research of Mr.  Ward
 with the assistance of our in-house chemists.
Our products are and
 in the future
 will continue to be identified by Mr. Ward based upon suggestions from our customers
 and from industry
and market research he conducts on an ongoing basis. We do not employ medical professionals and our management does not have experience
in the healthcare industry or in the treatment of disease. Our products have not been confirmed in any respect by the FDA or any
other governmental agency and may not produce the results intended. In developing products
 we require:



    
    
ingredients
    that are supported with a certificate of analysis
 publicly available scientific research and references which our Chief Executive
    Officer reviews with our in-house chemists who assist in developing our final products;

    
    
ingredients
    that are combined so that their effectiveness is not impaired;




    
    




    
    
the
    CBD contained in our products is less than 0.3% and all other ingredients are in dosage levels that fall within tolerable upper intake
    levels established for healthy people by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and products with hemp;

    
    
our
    products do not contain adulterated ingredients such as ephedra
 androstenedione
 aspartame
 steroids
 or human growth hormones;
    and

    
    
our
    formulations have a minimum of one-year shelf life.


Sales
and Marketing


actively participates in the planning of our marketing and selling efforts. We employ 1 in house sales representative and use the services
independent sales representatives on a commission basis. We believe that this sales structure enables us to effectively control our costs
and sales efforts.

We
believe that our marketing mix of social media promotions and search engine optimization is an optimal strategy to increase sales for
both our private label and branded products. We use web based marketing to promote our brands and products including social media and
promotion of our website at www.nutralifebiosciences.com. The information available on or accessible through our website is not a part
of
 and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. Our website provides useful information about our industry
 new developments
and our products and allows visitors to order our retail and wholesale wellness
 nutraceutical and CBD products. We use Search Engine
Optimization (SEO) on an ongoing basis to drive traffic to our website and social media pages and enhance our presence on major search
engines such as Google
 Bing and Yahoo.

We
aim to emphasize the development of long-term relationships with our customers. We believe that we have established strong relationships
with individual buyers at each of our private label customers
 and more importantly we have also established relationships with senior
management of our key private label customers.

A
key component of our ability to achieve long-term relationships is the high level of services that we provide to our customers. Each
salesperson is responsible for all aspects of a customer&rsquo;s needs
 including product samples
 obtaining orders
 coordinating product
selection
 monitoring production and delivering finished products. During the production process
 such salesperson is responsible for
informing the customer about the progress of an order
 including any difficulties that might affect delivery time. In this way
 we and
our customer can make appropriate arrangements regarding any delay or other change in the order. Further
 we seek to ensure that multiple
salespersons are familiar with each customer account so that they can work cooperatively to assist one another on a reciprocal basis.
We believe that this sales management technique provides an advantage over our competitors because it ensures that our customers always
have a knowledgeable salesperson available to discuss product orders and related issues.

Our
sales force is in constant contact with our customers to develop an understanding of the customers&rsquo; retail strategies and production
requirements. We use this information to provide our customers with products that meet their particular requirements efficiently. We
require that our sales force be knowledgeable about all aspects of our products. We believe our knowledgeable sales force enables it
to provide our customers immediate feedback as to the various costs and availability of various raw materials
 and production times.



As
of the date hereof
 we have approximately 14 full-time and part-time employees. 1 employee is a chemist engaged in product development
and testing
 4 are engaged in executive or administrative capacities
 10 employees are engaged in manufacturing
 packaging
 or distribution
and 1is engaged in sales.

From
time to time
 we employ temporary employees which provides us with flexibility to adjust staffing levels in response to demand.

None
of our employees are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have an excellent relationship with our employees
and independent contractors.

June
2019 Note

On
June 6
 2019
 the Company issued the June 2019 Note in the Principal Amount of $1
000
000. Pursuant to the terms of the June 2019 Note
the entire outstanding principal balance of the June 2019 Note matures on December 7
 2020. The June 2019 Note provides that until such
time as the Principal Amount of the June 2019 Note has been paid in full
 interest will accrue at the fixed rate of 8.5% per annum. Beginning
July 7
 2019 and through December 7
 2019
 the Company agreed to make interest only payments at a fixed rate of 8.5% per annum on the
Principal Amount of the June 2019 Note. Beginning on January 7
 2020 and continuing until the maturity date
 the Company agreed to make
equal monthly installment payments of principal and interest at the fixed rate of 8.5% per annum in an amount sufficient to fully amortize
the Principal Amount of the June 2019 Note and all accrued interest over an amortization period of 12 months
 until the amounts due under
the June 2019 Note are paid in full.

Pursuant
to the terms of the June 2019 Note
 all payments made by the Company to the Purchaser under the Transaction Documents
 including but
not limited to the June 2019 Note
 will be first applied to the Principal Amount then to accrued interest outstanding. Any and all consideration
paid by the Company to the Purchaser under the Transaction Documents will reduce the amounts secured by the June 2019 Mortgage without
affecting the amounts owed by the Company to the Purchaser under the Transaction Documents. The June 2019 Note is secured by the Collateral
Processors pursuant to the terms of the June 2019 Investment Agreement and the June 2019 Security Agreement. The Company agreed to deliver
a pledge of the Real Property to secure the Principal Amount pursuant to the terms of the June 2019 Pledge Agreement and June 2019 Mortgage
and the June 2019 Mortgage will be reduced from time to time by the consideration paid by the Company to the Purchaser. Simultaneously
with the payment of consideration equal to the Principal Amount of the June 2019 Note
 the Purchaser will record with the Palm Beach
County Property Appraiser&rsquo;s Officer a Satisfaction of the Mortgage releasing the Purchaser&rsquo;s June 2019 Mortgage on the Real
Property.

In
the event of a default of the June 2019 Note
 Purchaser has full recourse to all the assets of the Company and the Purchaser will be
required to proceed against or exhaust all remedies against both the Company and PhytoChem&rsquo;s assets prior to proceeding against
the June 2019 Mortgage and/or commencing an action to foreclose the June 2019 Mortgage.

At
any time while the June 2019 Note is outstanding
 the Purchaser will have the option of converting the Principal Amount and accrued interest
due on the June 2019 Note into common stock of the Company at a price of $1.00 per share. Upon conversion of the Principal Amount and/or
interest
 the Company will be forever released from all of its obligations and liabilities under the June 2019 Note. In the event Purchaser
converts less than all principal and interest outstanding
 the amount converted under the June 2019 Note will be first applied to reduce
the principal until it is paid in full. Additionally
 upon conversion of all outstanding principal at the time of conversion
 the June
2019 Mortgage will be released as security for the obligations and liabilities under the June 2019 Note.

For
purposes of the June 2019 Note
 an event of default means that the Company has failed to make any payment required under the June 2019
Note within 15 days after the date the payment is due. If the Company is in default under the June 2019 Note
 the unpaid principal and
accrued interests and any other unpaid amounts and costs due will bear interest at the rate of 10% (the &ldquo;Default Rate&rdquo;) until
the event of default is cured. From and after the Maturity Date any unpaid principal and interest and any other unpaid amounts and costs
under the June 2019 Note will bear interest at the Default Rate. Additionally
 and without limitation
 all amounts owed under any judgment
obtained by Purchaser against the Company with respect to the June 2019 Note will bear interest at the Default Rate. The June 2019 Note
provides that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the June 2019 Note will be settled by binding arbitration and judgment
on the award entered in any court having jurisdiction.

owing to the Purchaser
 and that it will deliver full and timely payment of all and any amounts due and/or which may become due to the
Purchaser from the Company from time to time in connection with the Transaction Documents without limitation. Purchaser agreed that it
understood that all consideration delivered to the Purchaser by the Company pursuant to the Transaction Documents will be applied to
the Principal Amount and as a result
 the Mortgage will be reduced by any and all payments of consideration of any type made by the Company
to the Purchaser under the Transaction Documents.


    
    


In

 under the terms of the June 2019 Pledge Agreement
 based upon the representations of the Company and the Purchaser that they
will perform and comply with their obligations and duties under the Transaction Documents
 the Pledgor agreed to provide the Purchaser

The June 2019 Mortgage will be reduced from time to time by any and all payments made by the Company to the Purchaser under the Transaction
Documents. In exchange for providing the Real Property collateral
 the Pledgor agreed to receive:



    
    
500
000
    shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock


    
    
    

    
    
Commencing

 and the June
2019 Mortgage will be deemed satisfied and released in full as security for the Principal Amount of the Amended Note
 and (iii) the Purchaser
will immediately record with the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser&rsquo;s Officer a Satisfaction of Mortgage releasing the Purchaser&rsquo;s
lien on the Real Property.

Pursuant
to the terms of the June 2019 Pledge Agreement
 a default means that the Company has failed to make any payment required under the June
2019 Note
 within 15 days after the date the payment is due. If after exhaustion of all other remedies
 including enforcement of the
lien against the Collateral and collection of all amounts due from the Company
 there remains a default
 then the Purchaser will provide
written notice to the Pledgor of the default and the Pledgor will have the option but not the obligation to cure the default. In such
event
 the amounts paid by the Pledgor will bear interest at the highest rate allowed under Florida law. So long as the Company is in
default of its obligations under the June 2019 Note

the Company defaults on its obligations under the June 2019 Note
 the June 2019 Pledge Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements

Stock
Purchase Agreement

On

 the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;SPA&rdquo;) by and
between the Company
 Lord Global Corporation
 a Nevada corporation (the &ldquo;Lord Global&rdquo;) and 27 Health
 Inc.
 a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Lord Global (&ldquo;27 Health&rdquo;). Pursuant to the SPA
 the Company acquired from Lord Global 250 shares of Series
X Convertible Preferred Stock of Lord Global (the &ldquo;Series X Stock&rdquo;) in exchange for the issuance by the Company to 27 Health
of 12
500
000 shares of common stock

 of the Company (the &ldquo;NutraLife Common Stock&rdquo;). The transactions
pursuant to the SPA closed on the Closing Date.

Each
share of Series X Stock is convertible into shares of common stock
 par value $0.001 per share
 of Lord Global (the &ldquo;Lord Global
Common Stock&rdquo;) at the rate of 1
000 shares of Lord Global Common Stock per share of Series X Stock
 subject to customary adjustments
for stock splits
 stock dividend
 stock combinations
 recapitalizations or other similar transactions. The conversion of the Series X
Stock is subject to a customary beneficial limitation such that the Company may not convert the Series X Stock into Lord Global Common
Stock if such conversion would result in the Company and its affiliates having beneficial ownership of in excess of 4.99% of the outstanding
shares of Lord Global Common Stock
 provided that the Company may elect to waive this limitation on 61 days&rsquo; notice to Lord Global.

In
addition to the Series X Stock issued to the Company

day following the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date
 provided that at this adjustment the number of First Adjustment Shares will
also be deducted from any additional shares to be issued to the Company.


    
    


Manufacturing
Distribution and Sales Agreement

In
connection with the SPA and the transactions as set forth therein
 on the Closing Date the Company also entered into a Manufacturing
Distribution and Sales Agreement (the &ldquo;MDS Agreement&rdquo;) by and between the Company and 27 Health. 27 Health
 together with
Lord Global (referred to in this section jointly as &ldquo;27 Health&rdquo;) has developed and currently manufactures and markets certain
products related to the testing and treatment of COVID-19 (the &ldquo;Coviguard Products&rdquo;).

Pursuant
to the MDS Agreement
 27 Health engaged the Company to manufacture the Coviguard Products and granted the Company the right
 on a non-exclusive
basis
 to sell and distribute the Coviguard Products manufactured by the Company though all channels of distribution on a worldwide basis
and to undertake advertising and marketing as determined to be necessary by the Company
 with written notice
 in connection therewith.

During
the term of the Agreement
 the Company has the exclusive right to manufacture the Coviguard Products
 subject to the Company&rsquo;s
continued ability to meet in all material respects the production requirements of 27 Health for the Coviguard Products. In the event
that the Company is unable
 in the sole determination of 27 Health
 to meet the production requirements
 27 Health may seek other sources
for the manufacturing of the Coviguard Products or may terminate the MDS Agreement.

Pursuant
to the MDS Agreement
 the Company may elect to market the Coviguard Products directly
 without any requirement of an order for the manufacturing
of the products being supplied by 27 Health or accepted by the Company. All such direct sales will be made by the Company to the recipient
of the products
 and the Company will pay to 27 Health a set distributor price for the products
 and retain the balance paid by the buyer.

In
the event that the Company identifies a potential third-party customer for the Coviguard Products
 but does not elect to sell the Coviguard
Products directly to the customer as set forth above
 the Company may refer such potential customer to 27 Health. If the customer is
a not a current customer of 27 Health
 then for any and all sales of Coviguard Products to such new customers
 27 Health will pay to
the Company 15% commissions on these sales. No commissions would be paid for sales to customers who were already customers of 27 Health
at the time.

The
MDS Agreement has an initial term of 5 years
 with automatic extensions of 1 year each
 subject to earlier expiration or termination
as set forth therein.

Competitive
Business Conditions

The
nutritional
 dietary supplement and industrial hemp CBD industries
 as well as the sanitizer products industry
 are highly competitive.
Numerous manufacturers and distributors compete with us for customers throughout the United States selling products to private label
customers and retailers such as mass merchandisers
 drug store chains
 independent pharmacies and health food stores. We are also vulnerable
to competition from companies that can manufacture similar products to our products and compete for private label customers. The markets
for our products are highly competitive. We seek to compete on the basis of customer service
 product quality
 pricing and marketing
support.

We
compete with major private label and broadline brand manufacturers many of which are larger and have access to greater resources than
us. Among other factors
 competition among private label manufacturers is based upon price. If one or more private label or broadline
brand manufacturers significantly reduce their prices in an effort to gain market share
 our results of operations or market position
could be adversely affected. We also compete with manufacturers of nationally advertised brand name products which are larger and have
resources substantially greater than us. In the future
 one or more of these companies could seek to compete more directly with us by
manufacturing private label products or by significantly lowering the prices of their national brand products.



    
    


Many
of our indirect competitors are substantially larger
 have more experience than us
 have longer operating histories
 and have materially
greater financial and other resources than us.

Costs
and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws

We
are in a business that involves the use of raw materials in a manufacturing process
 however
 we believe that it is unlikely that such
materials are likely to result in the violation of any existing environmental rules and/or regulations. Further
 we do not own any real
property that could lead to liability as a landowner. Therefore
 we do not anticipate that there will be any material costs associated
with compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

Product
Liability Insurance

We
maintain commercial liability
 including product liability coverage
 and property insurance. Our policy provides for a general liability
of five million dollars ($5
000
000) per occurrence
 and five million dollars ($5
000
000) annual aggregate coverage which includes our
main corporate facility. We carry property coverage on our main office facility to cover our legal liability
 tenant&rsquo;s improvements
business property
 and inventory.

Regulation
of our Hemp Finished Products

The
sale of our Hemp Finished Products is potentially subject to a complex web of federal and state regulations that are evolving at a rapid
rate. The formulation
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 advertising
 and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by
one or more federal agencies
 principally the Food and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;)
 the Federal Trade Commission (&ldquo;FTC&rdquo;)
and
 to a lesser extent
 the Consumer Product Safety Commission (&ldquo;CPSC&rdquo;)
 the United States Department of Agriculture (&ldquo;USDA&rdquo;)
Drug Enforcement Agency (&ldquo;DEA&rdquo;) and the Environmental Protection Agency (&ldquo;EPA&rdquo;). Our activities are also regulated
by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold
 as well as by governmental agencies in
certain countries outside the United States in which our products are sold. These agencies can change their rules at any time. Should
we become subject to FDA
 DEA or other enforcement proceedings we would have to cease operations.

The
FDA under the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act regulates the formulation
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 distribution and sale
of drugs
 food
 including dietary supplements
 and over-the-counter drugs.

Until
2014
 when 7 U.S. Code &sect;5940 became federal law as part of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the &ldquo;2014 Farm Act&rdquo;)
 products
containing oils derived from hemp
 notwithstanding a minimal or non-existing THC content
 were classified as Schedule I illegal drugs.
The 2014 Farm Act expired on September 30
 2018
 and was thereafter replaced by the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 on December
20
 2018 (the &ldquo;2018 Farm Act&rdquo;)
 which amended various sections of the U.S. Code
 thereby removing hemp
 defined as cannabis
with less than 0.3% of THC
 from Schedule 1 status under the Controlled Substances Act (&ldquo;CSA&rdquo;)
 and legalizing the cultivation
and sale of hemp at the federal level
 subject to compliance with certain federal requirements and state law
 amongst other things. THC
is the psychoactive component of plants in the cannabis family generally identified as marihuana or marijuana. We believe that our hemp
products are and will continue to be federally legal in the United States in that they contain and will continue to contain less than
0.3% of THC in compliance with the 2018 Farm Bill guidelines and will have no psychoactive effects on our customers&rsquo; bodies. Notwithstanding
there is no assurance that the 2018 Farm Act will not be repealed or amended such that our products containing hemp-derived CBD would
once again be deemed illegal under federal law.

The
2018 Farm Bill also shifted regulatory authority from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Agriculture. The 2018
Farm Bill did not change the FDA&rsquo;s oversight authority over hemp products. The 2018 Farm Act delegated the authority
to the states to regulate and limit the production of hemp and hemp derived products within their territories. Although many states have
adopted laws and regulations that allow for the production and sale of hemp and hemp derived products under certain circumstances
 no
assurance can be given that such state laws may not be repealed or amended such that our hemp products would once again be deemed illegal
under the laws of one or more states now permitting such products
 which in turn would render such products illegal in those states under
federal law even if the federal law is unchanged. In the event of either repeal of federal or of state laws and regulations
 or of amendments
thereto that are adverse to our hemp products
 we may be restricted or limited with respect to those products that we may sell or distribute
which could adversely impact our operations with respect to such products.


    
    


Additionally
the FDA has indicated its view that certain types of hemp products may not be permissible under the United States Federal Food
 Drug
and Cosmetic Act (&ldquo;FDCA&rdquo;). The FDA&rsquo;s position is related to its approval of Epidiolex
 a marijuana-derived prescription
medicine to be available in the United States. The active ingredient in Epidiolex is CBD. On December 20
 2018
 after the passage of
the 2018 Farm Bill
 FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement in which he reiterated the FDA&rsquo;s position that
 among other
things
 the FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit
 or with
any other disease claim
 to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce and that
the FDCA prohibits introducing into interstate commerce food products containing added hemp
 and marketing products containing hemp as
a dietary supplement
 regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Although we believe our hemp product offerings comply with
applicable federal and state laws and regulations
 legal proceedings alleging violations of such laws could have a material adverse effect
on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

We
do not intend to offer and do not compete with companies that offer cannabis products containing high levels of psychoactive THC in the
United States. Although legal in some states in the United States

 and do not intend to enter into this market
We offer hemp-based products to customers in the United States but do not compete with any medical or recreational marijuana sellers
of products for high THC content sales due to legal and regulatory restrictions and uncertainty in the United States.

The
FDA under the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act regulates the formulation
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 distribution and sale
of drugs
 food
 including dietary supplements
 and over-the-counter drugs and any inclusion of cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds
like CBD
 in such products would be regulated by the FDA regardless of the source of the cannabis substance
 be it hemp or marijuana.

Our
CBD products are derived from the seeds and mature stalks of the Cannabis Sativa plant which includes all parts and varieties of the
cannabis sativa plant also known as hemp
 which contain a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration (&ldquo;THC&rdquo;) that does not exceed
0.3 percent on a dry-weight basis. In December of 2018
 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration completed an evaluation of three generally
recognized as safe (GRAS) notices for hemp seed-derived food ingredients. The FDA stated that hulled hemp seed (GRN765)
 hemp seed protein
powder (GRN771)
 and hemp seed oil (GRN778) are GRAS under their intended conditions of use. Some of the intended uses for these ingredients
include adding them as source of protein
 carbohydrates
 oil
 and other nutrients to beverages (juices
 smoothies
 protein drinks
 plant-based
alternatives to dairy products)
 soups
 dips
 spreads
 sauces
 dressings
 plant-based alternatives to meat products
 desserts
 baked
goods
 cereals
 snacks and nutrition bars. Our CBD products are made from seeds and mature stalks of hemp and contain only trace amounts
of THC
 we believe they qualify as GRAS products.

We
have not obtained and do not plan to obtain FDA approval of our CBD products. As a result
 we could be subject to enforcement proceedings
by the FDA. We do not believe that FDA enforcement proceedings are likely since our products only contain trace elements of THC and do
not cause the &ldquo;high&rdquo; associated with the THC in marijuana. Additionally
 Hemp Finished Products like those sold by us are
sold by large retailers online including Whole Foods
 Publix
 Wal-Mart and others. Despite the foregoing
 should we become subject to
FDA or other enforcement proceedings we could have to cease operations.

Other
Regulations Impacting our Hemp Finished - CBD Products

Some
states are considering various taxation of marijuana-related products including hemp finished products. These considerations seem to
range from routine sales taxes to taxes similar to those imposed on tobacco products. Though
 for the reasons described above
 we do
not believe the Hemp Finished Products to be subject to any marijuana-related taxation schemes
 it is unclear whether Hemp Finished Products
would fall under these tax plans if and when they are imposed.


    
    


IRS
section 280(E) prevents cannabis companies from deducting expenses from their income
 except for those considered cost of goods sold.
No deduction or credit is allowed for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business if such
trade or business (or the activities which comprise such trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within
the meaning of schedule I and II of the Controlled Substances Act) which is prohibited by federal law or the law of any State in which
such trade or business is conducted. Though
 for the reasons described above
 we do not believe the Hemp Finished Products to be appropriately
treated as a controlled substance
 if IRC 280(E) is enforced against us relating to deductions concerning our Hemp Finished Products
such tax treatment could create operating and cash flow problems in the future.

Cannabis
versus Hemp

While
hemp and cannabis are both derived from the same species (Cannabis sativa)
 there are major differences in the characteristics of the
respective plant strains that produce industrial hemp on the one hand
 and cannabis products on the other. In short
 hemp is a strain
of the Cannabis sativa plant that has been grown primarily for use in industrial applications and has been specifically cultivated to
produce a low tetrahydrocannabinol (&ldquo;THC&rdquo;) content and a high cannabidiol (&ldquo;CBD&rdquo;) content. THC is the psychoactive
constituent of cannabis and is responsible for producing the psychoactive effects of the drug. CBD is another active ingredient present
in Cannabis sativa plants
 and it largely acts to neutralize the psychoactive effects of THC and is not associated with psychoactive
effects. Since hemp strains have very little THC and a lot of CBD
 they do not produce psychoactive effects when ingested.

Regulation
of our Products not Containing CBD

The
formulation
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 advertising
 and distribution of our non-hemp based products are subject to regulation
by one or more federal agencies
 principally the FDA
 the FTC
 and
 to a lesser extent
the CPSC
 the  USDA
 and the
Environmental Protection Agency &ldquo;EPA&rdquo;. Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states
and localities in which our products are sold
 as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States in
which our products are sold. Among other matters
 regulation by the FDA and FTC are concerned with product safety and claims made with
respect to a product&rsquo;s ability to provide health-related benefits. Specifically
 the FDA
 under the FDCA
 regulates the formulation
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 distribution and sale of food
 including dietary
supplements
 and over-the-counter drugs. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products. The National Advertising Division (&ldquo;NAD&rdquo;)
of the Council of Better Business Bureaus oversees an industry sponsored
 self-regulatory system that permits competitors to resolve
disputes over advertising claims. The NAD has no enforcement authority of its own
 but may refer matters that appear to violate the Federal
Trade Commission Act or the FDCA to the FTC or the FDA for further action
 as appropriate.

Federal
agencies
 primarily the FDA and the FTC
 have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them including initiating
investigations
 issuing warning letters and cease and desist orders
 requiring corrective labeling or advertising
 requiring consumer
redress (for example
 requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold to consumers)
 seeking injunctive relief
or product seizures
 imposing civil penalties
 or commencing criminal prosecution. In addition
 certain state agencies have similar authority.
These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food
 dietary supplement and
over-the-counter drug industries
 including the imposition of civil penalties in the millions of dollars against a few industry participants.

The
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (&ldquo;DSHEA&rdquo;) was enacted in 1994
 amending the FDCA. We believe DSHEA is generally
favorable to consumers and to the dietary supplement industry. DSHEA establishes a statutory class of &ldquo;dietary supplements&rdquo;
which includes vitamins
 minerals
 herbs
 amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet. Dietary ingredients
marketed in the United States before October 15
 1994 may be marketed without the submission of a &ldquo;new dietary ingredient&rdquo;
(&ldquo;NDI&rdquo;) premarket notification to the FDA. Dietary ingredients not marketed in the United States before October 15
 1994
may require the submission
 at least seventy-five (75) days before marketing of an NDI notification containing information establishing
that the ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for its intended use. Among other things
 DSHEA prevents the FDA from regulating
dietary ingredients in dietary supplements as &ldquo;food additives&rdquo; and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on
product labels and in labeling. The FDA has issued final regulations under DSHEA and has issued draft guidance on NDI notification requirements.
Further guidance and regulations are expected. Several bills to amend DSHEA in ways that would make this law less favorable to consumers
and industry have been proposed in Congress.


    
    


The
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (&ldquo;NLEA&rdquo;) amended the FDCA to establish additional requirements for ingredient
and nutrition labeling and labeling claims for foods. If the NLEA labeling requirements change at a future time
 we may need to revise
our product labeling. Our non-CBD products are classified as dietary supplements. The FDA has concluded that THC and CBD products are
excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement. The FDA issued a Final Rule on GMPs for dietary supplements on June 22
 2007. The
GMPs cover manufacturers and holders of finished dietary supplement products
 including dietary supplement products manufactured outside
the United States that are imported for sale into the United States. Among other things
 the new GMPs: (a) require identity testing on
all incoming dietary ingredients
 call for a &ldquo;scientifically valid system&rdquo; for ensuring finished products meet all specifications
(b) include requirements related to process controls
 including statistical sampling of finished batches for testing and requirements
for written procedures
 and (c) require extensive recordkeeping.

We
have reviewed the GMPs and have taken steps to ensure compliance. While we believe we are in compliance
 there can be no assurance that
our operations or those of our suppliers will be in compliance in all respects at all times. Additionally
 there is a potential risk
of increased audits as the FDA and other regulators seek to ensure compliance with the GMP&rsquo;s.

On
December 22
 2006
 Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act
 which went into effect on
December 22
 2007. The law requires
 among other things
 that companies that manufacture or distribute nonprescription drugs or dietary
supplements report serious adverse events allegedly associated with their products to the FDA and institute recordkeeping requirements
for all adverse events (serious and non-serious). There is a risk that consumers
 the press and government regulators could misinterpret
reported serious adverse events as evidence of causation by the ingredient or product complained of
 which could lead to additional regulations
banned ingredients or products
 increased insurance costs and a potential increase in product liability litigation
 among other things.

The
Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (&ldquo;CPSIA&rdquo;) primarily addresses children&rsquo;s product safety but also improves
the administrative process of the CPSC. Among other things
 the CPSIA requires testing and certification of certain products and enhances
the CPSC&rsquo;s authority to order recalls.

The
FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (&ldquo;FSMA&rdquo;)
 enacted January 4
 2011
 amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA&rsquo;s
authority over various aspects of food regulation. The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines if there
is reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of
 or exposure to
 the food will cause serious adverse
health consequences or death to humans or animals. Other changes include the FDA&rsquo;s expanded access to records; the authority to
suspend food facility registrations and require high risk imported food to be accompanied by a certification; stronger authority to administratively
detain food; the authority to refuse admission of an imported food if it is from a foreign establishment to which a U.S. inspector is
refused entry for an inspection; and the requirement that importers verify that the foods they import meet domestic standards.

One
of the FSMA&rsquo;s more significant changes is the requirement of hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls (&ldquo;HARBPC&rdquo;)
for all food facilities required to register with the FDA
 except dietary supplement facilities in compliance with both GMPs and the
serious adverse event reporting requirements. Although dietary supplement facilities are exempt from the HARBPC requirements
 dietary
ingredient facilities might not qualify for the exemption. The HARBPC requirements
 which the FDA has yet to propose
 are expected to
be onerous because facilities will have to develop and implement preventive controls to assure that identified hazards are significantly
minimized or prevented
 monitor the effectiveness of the preventive controls and maintain numerous records related to the HARBPC. The
HARBPC requirements may increase the costs of dietary ingredients and/or affect our ability to obtain dietary ingredients.


    
    


As
required by Section 113(b) of the FSMA
 the FDA published in July 2011
 a draft guidance document clarifying when the FDA believes a
dietary ingredient is an NDI
 when a manufacturer or distributor must submit an NDI premarket notification to the FDA
 the evidence necessary
to document the safety of an NDI and the methods for establishing the identity of an NDI. The draft guidance
 if implemented as proposed
could have a material impact on our operations. Although our industry has strongly objected to several aspects of the draft guidance
it is unclear whether the FDA will make changes to the final guidance. In addition
 it is possible that the FDA will begin taking enforcement
actions consistent with the interpretations in the draft guidance before issuing a final version. The new FSMA requirements
 as well
as the FDA enforcement of the NDI guidance as written
 could require us to incur additional expenses
 which could be significant
 and
negatively impact our business in several ways
 including
 but not limited to
 the detention and refusal of admission of imported products
the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that such ingredients or products
are in compliance and the potential imposition of fees for re-inspection of noncompliant facilities. Each of these events would increase
our liability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows.

The
FTC and the FDA have pursued a coordinated effort to challenge what they consider to be unsubstantiated and unsafe weight-loss products
and have also coordinated enforcement against dietary supplement claims in other areas
 including children&rsquo;s products. Their efforts
to date have focused on manufacturers and marketers as well as media outlets
 and have resulted in a significant number of investigations
and enforcement actions
 some resulting in civil penalties of several million dollars under the Federal Trade Commission Act. We expect
that the FTC and the FDA will continue to focus on health-related claims for dietary supplements and foods which could cause our non-CBD
products to be the subject of an FTC/FDA inquiry.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR
 THE COMPANY&rsquo;S BUSINESS
 FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY
ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN SUCH CASE
 THE TRADING PRICE OR THE COMPANY&rsquo;S COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE AND YOU MAY LOSE PART OR ALL OF
YOUR INVESTMENT. THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K ALSO CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. PLEASE
SEE &ldquo;CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS&rdquo;.

Risks
Related to our Financial Condition

We
are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations.


 2020 and
December 31
 2019
 we received $125
000 and $2
781
659
 from the sale of our securities. For the years ended December 31
2020 and December 31
 2019
 our revenues were approximately $1
300
000 and $2
100
000
 respectively from the sale of our
products. Our operating expenses are presently approximately $330
000 per month or $3
960
000 annually which consist of rent
advertising
 salaries and other general and administrative expenses. Our cash on hand as of the date of this Annual Report on Form
10-K is $742 which is not sufficient to pay our operating expenses. We are in the process of obtaining
future financing and are dependent on the sale of our securities to help fund our operations. There is no assurance we will be
able to obtain future funding for our operations from the sale of our securities. The future issuance of our securities will result
in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing stockholders
 and would likely have an
adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. Obtaining financing would be subject to a number of factors
 including
investor acceptance. These factors may adversely affect the timing
 amount
 terms
 or conditions of any financing that we may obtain
or make any additional financing unavailable to us. If we do not obtain additional financing to fund our future operations
 our
business could fail and you could lose your investment.


    
    


There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our limited operating history and financial resources
and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.

For
the years ended December 31
 2020 and December 31
 2019
 we incurred net losses of approximately $2
900
000 and $4
000
000. As
a result
 our auditor has rendered an opinion that we may be unable to continue as a going concern. Our limited operating history and
financial resources raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our financial statements contain a
going concern qualification. Our financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty
and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail or completely suspend
our operations.

We
will need additional capital to fund our operations
 which
 if obtained
 could result in substantial dilution or significant debt service
obligations. Our inability to procure additional financing
 if required
 may have a material adverse effect on us. We may not be able
to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms
 which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial position.

We
require additional equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain
funds on commercially acceptable terms
 if at all. We expect to have ongoing needs for working capital in order to fund operations and
to continue to expand our operations. To that end
 we may be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. In
order to continue operating
 we may need to obtain additional financing
 either through borrowings
 private offerings
 public offerings
or some type of business combination
 such as a merger
 or buyout
 and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such pursuits.
We may be unable to acquire the additional funding necessary to continue operating. However
 there can be no assurance that we will be
successful in securing additional capital. If we are unsuccessful
 we may need to (a) initiate cost reductions; (b) forego business development
opportunities; (c) seek extensions of time to fund liabilities
 or (d) seek protection from creditors. Our inability to obtain any additional
financing could have a material adverse effect upon us. We may not be able to secure any additional financing we may need on terms favorable
to us
 or at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from
the date of this filing.

In
addition
 if we are unable to generate adequate cash from operations
 and if we are unable to find sources of funding
 it may be necessary
for us to sell one or more lines of business or all or a portion of our assets
 enter into a business combination
 or reduce or eliminate
operations. These possibilities
 to the extent available
 may be on terms that result in significant dilution to our investors or that
result in our investors losing all of their investment in our Company.

If
we are able to raise additional capital
 we do not know what the terms of any such capital raising would be. In addition
 any future
sale of our equity securities could be at prices substantially below prices at which our shares are currently valued. To the extent we
require additional financing and cannot raise it
 we may have to limit our then-current operations
 curtail all or certain portions of
our business objectives and plans or terminate our operations. We may seek to increase our cash reserves through the sale of additional
equity or debt securities. The sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional and potentially
substantial dilution to our investors. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result
in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations and liquidity. In addition
 our ability to obtain additional
capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts
or on terms acceptable to us
 if at all. Any failure to raise additional funds on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect
on our liquidity and financial condition.

If
we are unable to generate sufficient revenues for our operating expenses we will need financing
 which we may be unable to obtain; should
we fail to obtain sufficient financing
 our potential revenues will be negatively impacted.

For
the years ended December 31
 2020 and December 31
 2019
 our revenues were $1
255
784 and $2
133
624
 respectively
 from the sale
of our products. For the years ended December 31
 2020 and December 31
 2019
 we incurred net losses of $2
889
940 and $4
007
403.

Because
we lack historical financial data
 including revenue data
 our future revenues are unpredictable.



$330
000 per month or $3
960
000 annually which consist of rent
 advertising
 salaries and other general and administrative expenses.
Our cash on hand as of the date of this Form 10-K is $742 which is not sufficient to pay our operating expenses. In the
future
 we may require additional debt or equity funding to continue our operations. We intend to raise additional funds from an offering
of our stock in the future; however
 this offering may never occur
 or if it occurs
 we may be unable to raise the required funding.
Further new offerings of our common shares will dilute our existing shareholders and your investment in our common shares. We do not
have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding and we have no agreements for financing in place.



    
    


Our
liabilities could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations
 limit our ability to react to changes
in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.

As
of December 31
 2020
 our total liabilities were $4
405
598. Our liabilities could have important consequences for our
investors
 including: making it more difficult for us to make payments on indebtedness; increasing our vulnerability to general economic
and industry conditions; requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
interest on indebtedness when our indebtedness become due. This reduces our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations
 capital
expenditures and future business opportunities; limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to obtain additional financing
for working capital
 capital expenditures
 product development
 debt service requirements
 acquisitions and general corporate or other
purposes; and limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
competitors which have fewer liabilities. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new indebtedness is added
to our current debt levels
 the related risks that we face could increase.

We
are currently in default on certain secured debt obligations which could negatively affect our financial condition and may cause us to
curtail or cease our operations.

As
discussed above
 the Company has not made the principal and interest payments on the Amended Note as of the date of this Annual Report.
Accordingly
 the Company is currently in default on these secured debt obligations. The Company now believes that it may have defenses
to the enforcement of the Transaction Documents as written
 however this may not be the case. Additionally
 the Purchaser has not indicated
to the Company that it will seek to enforce its rights under the Transaction Documents or that it will proceed against the Collateral.
However
 if the Purchaser does seek to proceed against the Collateral
 the Company&rsquo;s financial condition will be negatively affected
and we may have to curtail our cease our operations altogether.

We
are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that require us to perform accounting and reporting obligations
with limited resources.

We
are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The reporting obligations
require additional staff or consulting expenses. In addition
 we have limited resources to allocate to such compliance functions
 which
increase the possibility of non-compliance.

Risks
Related to Our Business

We
have been growing rapidly and expect to continue to invest in our growth for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to manage our growth
effectively
 our revenue and profits could be adversely affected.

We
have experienced rapid growth in a relatively short period of time. Our revenues were approximately $1
300
000 and $2
100
000
for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 respectively. We plan to continue to expand our operations
 and we anticipate that further
significant expansion will place additional demands on our resources and operations. We presently operate our manufacturing and distribution
from a 6
400 square foot facility. We plan to begin manufacturing at a second facility consisting of 20
000 square feet in addition to
our existing facility. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully.
Sustaining our growth will place significant demands on our management as well as on our administrative
 operational
 and financial resources.
To manage our growth
 we must continue to improve our sales and manage our operational systems. If we are unable to manage our growth
successfully
 our revenue and profits could be harmed. Risks that we face in undertaking future expansion include but are not limited
to:



    
&#9679;
    
effectively
    recruiting
 integrating
 training
 and motivating new employees
 including our sales force
 while retaining existing private label
    distributors and effectively executing our new business plan focusing on the processing
 extraction and sale of CBD products;

    
    
satisfying
    existing customers and attracting new customers of our products and services;



    
    




    
    
introducing
    new products and services;

    
    
increasing
    our private label customers;

    
    
controlling
    expenses and investments in expanded operations including our new manufacturing facility;

    
    
implementing
    and enhancing our administrative
 operational
 and financial infrastructure
 systems
 and processes; and

    
    
addressing
    new products to meet consumer preferences.


A
failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business
 operating results and/or financial condition. Further
 due to our recent
rapid growth
 we have limited experience operating at our current scale and potentially at a larger scale
 and as a result
 it may be
difficult for us to fully evaluate future prospects and risks. Our recent and historical growth should not be considered indicative of
our future performance. We have encountered in the past
 and will encounter in the future
 risks and uncertainties frequently experienced
by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties
 which we use to plan
and operate our business
 are incorrect or change
 or if we do not address these risks successfully
 our financial condition and operating
results could differ materially from our expectations
 our growth rates may slow and our business would by adversely impacted.

Our
revenues are highly dependent upon four private label distributors
%
%
%
%
 of our revenues for the year December 31
 2020 and should
these distributors reduce their orders from us or should we lose these distributors; our revenues and results of operations would be
negatively affected which could cause you to lose your investment.

Our
revenues are concentrated and highly dependent on four (4) private label customers which represented 14.83%
 12.86%
 6.99%
 and
3.45%
 of our revenues for the year ended December 31
 2020. All sales made under a private label relationship are made on a purchase
order basis and there are no long-term contracts with respect to any private label relationships. There can be no assurance that existing
private label relationships will continue in the future or that we will be able to obtain new private label relationships on an ongoing
basis
 if at all. Our private label customers can reduce the products they order from us or cease ordering products from us at any time
without notice. There can be no assurance that these private label customers will continue to place orders with us
 that orders by such
customers will continue at their previous levels or that we can replace any such lost business. Should this occur
 our revenues and results
of operations will be negatively affected which could cause you to lose your investment in our common shares.

As
a result of our evolving business model
 we have a limited operating history in our lines of business and
 therefore
 we may not be able
to correctly estimate our future operating expenses
 which could lead to cash shortfalls.

Since
our inception
 our business model has evolved significantly. In 2017
 we began selling CBD products and as a result our revenues increased
from approximately $1
800
000 in 2017 to approximately $3
700
000 in 2018 and then decreased to $2
130
000 in 2019 and $1
300
000
in 2020. CBD became our main source of income
 and we focused on generating revenue through private label manufacturers. As a result
of the change in our business model
 our revenues have significantly increased from prior periods. We have a limited operating history
for our CBD products from which to evaluate our business. Additionally
 amid the COVID-19 global pandemic
 in 2020
 the Company made
a strategic pivot from our then-current nutraceutical manufacturing business by adding the manufacture of consumer sanitizer products
utilizing the Company&rsquo;s existing manufacturing capabilities and the Company&rsquo;s ability to retrofit its operations and accommodate
production due to the shortage of supply and demand for sanitizer products. We also have a limited operating history for our sanitized
products from which to evaluate our business. Our failure to successfully execute our business plan would have a material adverse effect
on our ability to continue operating. Accordingly
 our prospects must be considered in light of the risks
 expenses
 and difficulties
frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development. We may not be successful in addressing such risks
 and the failure
to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business
 operating results and financial condition.


    
    


Our
quarterly and annual expenses are likely to increase substantially over the next several years depending upon the level of capital spending
required to grow our revenues. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could adversely
impact our business prospects and make it more difficult to raise additional equity capital at an acceptable price per share.

We
do not have many written contracts with our customers. This allows such customers to use other companies instead of us which may negatively
impact on our sales.

Because
we do not have many written contracts with our customers who are free to purchase products from other suppliers
 our customers can choose
to use other companies instead. If a significant number of our customers began to use competing companies instead of us
 our sales would
decrease significantly.

An
unexpected interruption or shortage in the supply or significant increase in the cost of components could limit our ability to manufacture
any products
 which could reduce our sales and margins.

An
unexpected interruption of supply or a significant increase in the cost of components
 for any reason
 such as regulatory requirements
import restrictions
 loss of certifications
 disruption of distribution channels as a result of weather
 terrorism or acts of war
 fire
earthquake
 or other national disaster
 a work stoppage or other labor-related disruption
 failure in supply or other logistical channels
electrical outages
 or other events
 could result in significant cost increases and/or shortages of our products. Our inability to obtain
a sufficient amount of products or to pass through higher cost of products we offer could have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition or results of operations.

The
COVID-19 pandemic has already begun to adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s business and the ultimate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial condition will depend on future developments
 which are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted.

The
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
 including actions taken by businesses and governments
 have adversely affected the global economy
disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility in the financial markets. As a result
 the Company&rsquo;s business
operations have been limited due to government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and may also be
effected if Company&rsquo;s personnel is unable to work effectively due to illness
 quarantines
 or other restrictions in connection
with the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also already hindered the Company&rsquo;s ability to raise capital and stay current
in its reporting obligations with the SEC. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for a prolonged period
 the Company&rsquo;s business
 financial
condition
 results of operation and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected. The extent of the ultimate impact of the pandemic
on the Company&rsquo;s operational and financial performance will depend on various developments
 including the duration and spread of
the outbreak
 and its impact on potential customers
 employees
 and vendors
 all of which cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.
These future developments will also include
 but are not limited to
 the actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties
in response to the pandemic. Disruptions and/or uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result
in delays or modifications to the Company&rsquo;s strategic plans and initiatives and hinder the Company&rsquo;s ability to achieve its
goals.

Possible
yet unanticipated changes in federal and state law in the U.S. could cause our products containing hemp to be illegal
 or could otherwise
prohibit
 limit or restrict any of our products containing hemp.

Until
2014
 when 7 U.S. Code &sect;5940 became federal law as part of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the &ldquo;2014 Farm Act&rdquo;)
 products
containing hemp
 notwithstanding a minimal or non-existing THC content
 were classified as Schedule I illegal drugs. The 2014 Farm Act
expired on September 30
 2018
 and was thereafter replaced by the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 on December 20
 2018 (the &ldquo;2018
Farm Act&rdquo;)
 which amended various sections of the U.S. Code
 thereby removing hemp
 defined as cannabis with less than 0.3% of
THC
 from Schedule 1 status under the Controlled Substances Act (&ldquo;CSA&rdquo;)
 and legalizing the cultivation and sale of hemp
at the federal level
 subject to compliance with certain federal requirements and state law
 amongst other things. THC is the psychoactive
component of plants in the cannabis family generally identified as marihuana or marijuana. We anticipate that our hemp-based products
are and will continue to be federally legal in the United States in that they do
 and will contain less than 0.3% of THC in compliance
with the 2018 Farm Bill guidelines and will have no psychoactive effects on our customers&rsquo; bodies. Notwithstanding
 there is no
assurance that the 2018 Farm Act will not be repealed or amended such that our products containing hemp would once again be deemed illegal
under federal law.


    
    


The
2018 Farm Bill also shifted regulatory authority from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Agriculture. The 2018
Farm Bill did not change the FDA oversight authority over hemp-based
products. The 2018 Farm Act delegated the authority to the states to regulate and limit the production of hemp and hemp derived products
within their territories. Although many states have adopted laws and regulations that allow for the production and sale of hemp and hemp
derived products under certain circumstances
 no assurance can be given that such state laws may not be repealed or amended such that
our products containing hemp would once again be deemed illegal under the laws of one or more states now permitting such products
 which
in turn would render such products illegal in those states under federal law even if the federal law is unchanged. In the event of either
repeal of federal or of state laws and regulations
 or of amendments thereto that are adverse to our hemp-based products
 we may be restricted
or limited with respect to those products that we may sell or distribute
 which could adversely impact our business operations with respect
to such products.

Additionally
the FDA has indicated its view that certain types of products containing hemp may not be permissible under the FDCA. The FDA&rsquo;s position is related to its approval of Epidiolex
 a marijuana-derived
prescription medicine to be available in the United States. The active ingredient in Epidiolex is hemp-derived CBD. On December 20
 2018
after the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill
 FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement in which he reiterated the FDA&rsquo;s position
that
 among other things
 the FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic
benefit
 or with any other disease claim
 to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate
commerce and that the FDCA prohibits introducing into interstate commerce food products containing added hemp
 and marketing products
containing hemp-derived ingredients
 including
 but not limited to CBD
 as a dietary supplement
 regardless of whether the substances
are hemp-derived. Although we believe our planned hemp-based product offerings do and will continue to comply with applicable federal
and state laws and regulations
 legal proceedings alleging violations of such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition and results of operations.

FDA
regulation could negatively affect the hemp industry
 which would directly affect our financial condition.

The
FDA may seek expanded regulation of hemp under the FDCA. Additionally
 the FDA may issue rules and regulations
 including certified good
manufacturing practices
 or cGMPs
 related to the growth
 cultivation
 harvesting and processing of hemp. Clinical trials may be needed
to verify efficacy and safety. It is also possible that the FDA would require that facilities where hemp is grown register with the FDA
and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations. In the event that some or all of these regulations are imposed
 we do not know
what the impact would be on the hemp industry
 including what costs
 requirements and possible prohibitions may be enforced. If we or
our partners are unable to comply with the regulations or registration as prescribed by the FDA
 we and or our partners may be unable
to continue to operate our and their business in its current or planned form or at all.

Confusion
between legal hemp and illegal cannabis.

There
is risk that confusion or uncertainty surrounding our products with regulated cannabis could occur on the state or federal level and
impact us. We may have difficulty with establishing banking relationships
 working with investment banks and brokers who would be willing
to offer and sell our securities or accept deposits from stockholders
 and auditors willing to certify our financial statements if we
are confused with businesses that are in the cannabis business. Any of these additional factors
 should they occur
 could also affect
our business
 prospects
 assets or results of operation could have a material adverse effect on the business
 prospects
 results of operations
or financial condition of the Company.

Because
we are subject to numerous laws and regulations we could incur substantial costs.

The
manufacture
 labeling and distribution of our products is regulated by various federal
 state and local agencies. These governmental
authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings
 which could restrict the permissible scope of our product claims or the ability
to sell our products in the future. The FDA regulates our nutraceutical and wellness products to ensure that the products are not adulterated
or misbranded.


    
    


We
are subject to additional regulation as a result of our CBD products. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain
robust systems to comply with different compliance in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that we may violate one or more
of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply
to us
 we may be subject to penalties
 including
 without limitation
 civil and criminal penalties
 damages
 fines
 the curtailment or
restructuring of our operations
 any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

Failure
to comply with FDA requirements may result in
 among other things
 injunctions
 product withdrawals
 recalls
 product seizures
 fines
and criminal prosecutions. Our advertising is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTCA. In recent years
 the FTC has initiated
numerous investigations of dietary and nutrition supplement products and companies. Additionally
 some states also permit advertising
and labeling laws to be enforced by private attorney generals
 who may seek relief for consumers
 seek class action certifications
 seek
class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by us. Any actions against us by governmental authorities or private litigants
could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

Adverse
publicity or consumer perception of our products and any similar products distributed by others could harm our reputation and adversely
affect our sales and revenues.

We
are highly dependent upon positive consumer perceptions of the safety and quality of our products as well as similar products distributed
by other wellness
 nutraceutical and CBD companies. Consumer perception of nutrition supplements and our products
 in particular
 can
be substantially influenced by scientific research or findings
 national media attention and other publicity about product use. Adverse
publicity from these sources regarding the safety
 quality or efficacy of nutritional supplements and our products could harm our reputation
and results of operations. The mere publication of news articles or reports asserting that such products may be harmful or questioning
their efficacy could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations
 regardless of whether
such news articles or reports are scientifically supported or whether the claimed harmful effects would be present at the dosages recommended
for such products.

If
the products we sell do not have the healthful effects intended
 our business may suffer.

In
general
 our products contain food
 nutritional supplements which do not currently require approval from the FDA or other regulatory
agencies prior to sale. Many of our products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. There is little long term
experience with human or other animal consumption of certain of these ingredients or combinations thereof in concentrated form. Our products
could have certain side effects if not taken as directed or if taken by a consumer that has certain medical conditions. Furthermore
there can be no assurance that any of the products
 even when used as directed
 will have the effects intended or will not have harmful
side effects. Should our products cause unwanted side effects or not have the results intended
 it could have a material adverse effect
on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

We
could suffer reputational and financial damage in the event of injury from our products or product recalls.

As
a manufacturer and distributor of products intended for human consumption
 we are subject to product liability claims if the use of our
products for others is alleged to have resulted in injury. Our products consist of vitamins
 minerals
 herbs
 lotions and other ingredients
that are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States or internationally. Previously unknown adverse reactions
resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur which would likely result in product liability claims against us which
would increase our costs and adversely affect our reputation and harm our business. We may be held liable if any illness or injury caused
by any product we develop
 manufacture or distribute
 if any such product is found to be unsuitable for use. In addition to any reputational
damage we would suffer
 we cannot guarantee that our product liability insurance or that of any of our suppliers would fully cover potential
liabilities. In the event of litigation
 any adverse judgments against us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
including our cash balances
 and results of operations.


    
    


Our
insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our legal claims or other losses that we may incur in the future.

We
maintain insurance
 including property
 general and product liability
 and workers&rsquo; compensation to protect ourselves against potential
loss exposures. There is no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient to cover any claims that are asserted against us. In the
future
 insurance coverage may not be available at adequate levels or on adequate terms to cover potential losses
 including on terms
that meet our customer&rsquo;s requirements. If insurance coverage is inadequate or unavailable
 we may face claims that exceed coverage
limits or that are not covered
 which could increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.

Our
intellectual property rights are valuable
 and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brand.

We
manufacture products primarily for third parties who sell the products under their own brand names. We also sell products under our own
brand names. Our product formulations are not patented and there are numerous companies selling similar products. As such
 third parties
could copy our products or sell similar products to our distributors and/or customers.

Our
competitors may have or develop equivalent or superior manufacturing and design skills
 and may develop an enhancement to our formulations
that will be patentable or otherwise protected from duplication by others. Further
 we may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce
our intellectual property rights
 including our trademarks
 from infringement. Our inability to obtain and/or failure to enforce our
intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our product offerings and have a material adverse effect on our business
 prospects
results of operations
 and financial condition.

If
we are unable to obtain and maintain protection of our intellectual property
 the value of our products may be adversely affected.

Our
business is dependent in part upon our ability to use intellectual property rights to protect our products from competition. To protect
our products
 we rely on a combination of patent and other intellectual property laws
 employment
 confidentiality and invention assignment
agreements with our employees and contractors
 and confidentiality agreements and protective contractual provisions with our partners
licensors and other third parties. These methods
 however
 afford us only limited protection against competition from other products.

We
attempt to protect our intellectual property position
 in part
 by filing patent applications related to our proprietary technology
inventions and improvements that are important to our business. However
 our patent position is not likely by itself to prevent others
from commercializing products that compete directly with our products. In addition
 the patent owned by us or issued to us could be challenged
invalidated
 or held to be unenforceable. We also note that any patent granted may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Our competitors
may independently develop technologies that are substantially similar or superior to our technologies. Further
 third parties may design
around our patented or proprietary products and technologies.

We
rely on certain trade secrets and we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets even with contracts with our personnel and
third parties. Also
 any third party could independently develop and have the right to use
 our trade secret
 know-how and other proprietary
information. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights
 our business
 prospects
 financial condition and results of
operations could suffer materially.

We
may be involved in lawsuits or proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against infringement claims
which could be expensive and time consuming.

Our
success depends in part on our products not infringing on the patents and proprietary rights of other parties. For instance
 in the United
States
 patent applications filed in recent years are confidential for 18 months
 while older applications are not published until the
patent issues. As a result
 there may be patents and patent applications of which we are unaware
 and avoiding patent infringement may
be difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights
 protect our trade secrets or determine the validity
and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Interference proceedings conducted by a patent and trademark office may be necessary to
determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications. Litigation or interference proceedings could result in
substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition
 in an infringement proceeding
 a court may decide
that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the
grounds that our patents do not cover the technology. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one
or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.
In addition
 we may be enjoined from marketing one or more of our products if a court finds that such products infringe the intellectual
property rights of a third party. During litigation
 we may not be able to prevent the confidentiality of certain of our proprietary
rights because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation. In addition
 during
the course of litigation
 there could be public announcements of the results of hearings
 motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
If investors or customers perceive these results to be negative
 it could have a material adverse effect on our business
 prospects
financial condition and results of operations.


    
    


Our
business is highly competitive
 and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our market share
 financial condition and
future growth.

The
nutritional supplement
 wellness and CBD industries are highly competitive with respect to price
 brand and product recognition and new
product introductions. Many of our competitors are larger
 more established and possess greater financial
 personnel
 distribution and
other resources. We face competition (a) in the health food channel from a limited number of large nationally known manufacturers
 private
label brands and many smaller manufacturers of dietary and nutrition supplements; and (b) in the mass-market distribution channel from
manufacturers
 major private label manufacturers and others. Private label brands at mass-market chains represent substantial sources
of income for these merchants and the mass-market merchants often support their own labels at the expense of other brands. As such
 the
growth of our brands within food
 drug
 and general mass-market merchants are highly competitive and uncertain. If we cannot compete
effectively
 we may not be profitable.

We
may experience greater than expected product returns
 which might adversely affect our sales and results of operations.

In
the year ended December 31
 2020
 product returns represented 1% of our sales. Products may be returned for various reasons
 including
expiration dates or lack of sufficient sales volume. Any increase in product returns could reduce our results of operations.

The
purchase of many of our products is discretionary and may be negatively impacted by adverse trends in the general economy and make it
more difficult for us to generate revenues.

Our
business is affected by general economic conditions since our products are discretionary and we depend
 to a significant extent
 upon
a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending. These factors include economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions
by consumers
 employment rates
 the level of consumers&rsquo; disposable income
 business conditions
 interest rates
 consumer debt levels
and availability of credit. Consumer spending on our products may be adversely affected by changes in general economic conditions.

We
may not be able to anticipate consumer preferences and trends within the diet and nutritional industry
 which could negatively affect
acceptance of our products by retailers and consumers and result in a significant decrease in our revenues.

Our
products must appeal to a broad range of consumers
 whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.
Our products will need to successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands. If our products are not successfully received by our
private label distributors and their customers
 our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and prospects may be harmed.

Risks
Related to Our Management

Should
we lose the services of Edgar Ward
 our founder
 Chief Executive Officer
 President and sole Director
 our financial condition and proposed
expansion may be negatively impacted.

Our
future depends on the continued contributions of Edgar Ward
 our founder
 Chief Executive Officer
 President and sole Director who would
be difficult to replace. The services of Mr. Ward are critical to the management of our business and operations. Additionally
 we do
not maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Ward. Should we lose the services of Mr. Ward
 and be unable to replace his services with
equally competent and experienced personnel
 our operational goals and strategies would likely be adversely affected
 which will negatively
affect our revenues.


    
    


Edgar
Ward
 our founder
 Chief Executive Officer
 President and sole Director has voting control of the Company.

Edgar
Ward
 our founder
 Chief Executive Officer
 President and sole Director holds voting and dispositive control over 24.43% of our
issued and outstanding common stock shares. Further he holds 100% of our issued and outstanding Series A Preferred stock. Each share
of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to 500
000 votes per share or an aggregate of 500
000
000 votes. Therefore
 Edgar Ward effectively
has voting control over the Company
 which could lead to a conflict of interest where Mr. Wards interests do not align with those of
ordinary shareholders of the Company.

Because
we do not have an audit or compensation committee
 shareholders will have to rely on the one member of our board of directors who is
not independent to perform these functions.

We
do not have an audit or compensation committee or board of directors as a whole
 that is composed of independent directors. These functions
are performed by our sole director. Because our sole Director is not independent
 there is a potential conflict between their or our
interests and our shareholders&rsquo; interests since Edgar Ward
 our sole Board Member
 is also our Chief Executive Officer and President
who will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. Until we
have an audit committee or independent directors
 there may less oversight of management decisions and activities and little ability
for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities and decisions
 even if they are not in the best interests of minority
shareholders.

Our
Vice-President devotes limited time to our business
 which may negatively impact our plan of operations
 implementation of our business
plan and our potential profitability.

Neil
Catania
 our Vice-President currently devotes only ten (10) hours to our business each month. Our Chief Executive Officer and President
Edgar Ward
 devotes full time to our business however
 there is no assurance he will be able to do so in the future. Management time
devoted to our business activities in the future may be inadequate to implement our plan of operations and develop a profitable business.

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock

The
Company is currently delinquent in its Reporting Obligations with the SEC and accordingly the Company currently has a &ldquo;Pink Limited
Information&rdquo; Yield Sign Symbol on OTC Markets.

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Limited Information Tier of OTC Markets under the symbol
 &ldquo;NLBS.&rdquo; We
are currently labeled as &ldquo;Delinquent SEC Reporting&rdquo; and have a red yield sign next to our name on OTC Markets because
the Company has not filed all of its required periodic reports since we filed our Quarterly Report for the Quarter ended September 30
2020
 which was filed with the SEC on May 12
 2021. We believe that filing this Form 10-K and our subsequent planned filing of our Form
10-Q for the quarter ended March 31
 2021
 will bring us current with our reporting obligations with the SEC so that our profile on OTC
Markets can be updated accordingly to reflect Current Information and remove the yield sign as well as the &ldquo;Delinquent SEC
Reporting&rdquo; label. However
 there can be no assurance that we&rsquo;ll be able to accomplish the foregoing as planned or at all.

Our
Chief Executive Officer
 President and sole Director has voting control over all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders
which will prevent our minority shareholders from having the ability to control any of our corporate actions.

As
of June 24
 2021
 we had 160
740
200 shares of our common stock outstanding
 each entitled to one vote per common share.
Our Chief Executive Officer
 President and sole Director
 Edgar Ward
 held 24.43% of our issued and outstanding common stock and
1
000 Series A Preferred which provide 500
000 votes per share or an aggregate of 500
000
000 votes on all matters submitted to our stockholders.
As a result
 Mr. Ward has voting control of the Company and has the ability to determine the outcome of all matters submitted to our
stockholders for approval
 including the election of directors. Mr. Ward&rsquo;s control of our voting securities may make it impossible
to complete some corporate transactions without his support and may prevent a change in our control. In addition
 this ownership could
discourage the acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect
 possibly depressing the
trading price of our common stock.


    
    


We
will
 in the future
 issue additional securities which would reduce investors&rsquo; percent of ownership and will cause dilution to
our existing shareholders.

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 499
990
000 shares of common stock. As of June 24
 2021
 we had 160
740
200
shares of common stock outstanding. Accordingly
 we may issue additional shares of common stock. The future issuance of common stock
may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any common
stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis including for services or acquisitions or other corporate actions that may have the
effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our stockholders
 and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common
stock. Additionally
 we are authorized to issue 10
000 shares of preferred stock
 of which we currently have 1
000 shares of our Series
A Preferred stock issued and outstanding and 20 shares of Series B Preferred stock issued and outstanding. Further
 our board of directors
may designate the rights
 terms and preferences of our authorized but unissued preferred shares at our discretion including conversion
and voting preferences without notice to our shareholders.

The
sale of the additional shares of common stock could cause dilution as well as the value of our common stock to decline.

The
sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock
 or anticipation of such sales
 could make it more difficult for us to sell
equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish. Further
 if we do sell or issue
more common stock
 any investors&rsquo; investment in the Company will be diluted. Dilution is the difference between what you pay for
your stock and the net tangible book value per share immediately after the additional shares are sold by us. If dilution occurs
 any
investment in the Company&rsquo;s common stock could seriously decline in value.

Our
common stock is subject to the application of the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules which could adversely affect the market price of our
common stock and increase transaction costs to sell those shares.

The
SEC has adopted rule 3a51-1 which establishes the definition of a &ldquo;penny stock
&rdquo; for the purposes relevant to us
 as any
equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject
to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
 Rule 15g-9 requires:



    
    
that
    a broker or dealer approve a person&rsquo;s account for transactions in penny stocks
 and

    
    
the
    broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction
 setting forth the identity and quantity of the
    penny stock to be purchased.

    
    
    

    
    
In
    order to approve a person&rsquo;s account for transactions in penny stocks
 the broker or dealer must:

    
    
    

    
    
obtain
    financial information and investment experience objectives of the person
 and

    
    
make
    a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge
    and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.


The
broker or dealer must also deliver
 prior to any transaction in a penny stock
 a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to
the penny stock market
 which
 in highlight form:



    
    
sets
    forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and

    
    
that
    the broker or dealer received a signed
 written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.



    
    


Generally
brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules. This may make it more
difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.

The
market price for our common stock is particularly volatile which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable
to sell your common stock shares at or above your purchase price
 or at all
 which may result in substantial losses to you.

The
market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers
 and we expect that our
share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. As a consequence of this enhanced risk
more risk-adverse investors may
 under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress
be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a
seasoned issuer. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our
operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock shares
will be at any time
 or as to what effect the sale of shares or the availability of common stock shares for sale at any time will have
on the prevailing market price.

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder&rsquo;s ability to buy and sell our stock.

In
addition to the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules described above
 FINRA has adopted FINRA Rule 2111 that requires a broker-dealer to have
reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending the investment. Prior to recommending
speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers
 broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information
about the customer&rsquo;s financial status
 tax status
 investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these
rules
 FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some
customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock
 which
may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.

We
do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We
anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes.
Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.

If
we are unable to comply with the financial reporting requirements mandated by the SEC&rsquo;s regulations
 investors may lose confidence
in our financial reporting and the price of our common stock
 if a market ever does develop for it
 could decline.

If
we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting
 our ability to produce timely
 accurate and reliable periodic
financial statements could be impaired. If we do not maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting
 investors could lose
confidence in the accuracy of our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act. Additionally
 our ability to obtain additional financing
could be impaired or a lack of investor confidence in the reliability and accuracy of our public reporting could cause our stock price
to decline.

 Case No. 50-2020-CA-008435
was filed in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County
 Florida on August 9
 2020. In the suit
Hamilton &amp; Associates Law Group
 P.A. sets forth purported claims for breach of contract
 and in the alternative
 account stated
open account
 unjust enrichment
 and quantum meruit. Plaintiff requests a judgment for damages in the principal sum of $150
005
plus an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs pursuant to a legal services agreement dated January 7
 2019
 as well as pre-judgment
interest and post-judgment interest. The Hamilton matter filed directly against the Corporation initially included a claim against Edgar
Ward
 but the individual claim has been dropped. The prior engagement agreement between the Hamilton law firm and the Company (for 2018)
was in the nature of a flat fee engagement
 in which shares were provided in lieu of cash payments. The Company maintains that the change
in the engagement of the law firm (from 2018 to 2019) in terms of the nature of payment was not disclosed or explained adequately
 and
the Company was unaware of any claim that sums remained unpaid
 as all fees were understood to be paid as a result of the shares of stock
provided. The claim was filed on August 9
 2020
 and is not set for trial
 and only documentary discovery has been conducted to date.

: Native American Partners LLC

and Best Darn Brands
 LLC
 and its subsidiaries v. Nutralife Biosciences Inc.
 Case No. CACE-20-009352
 was filed in the Circuit Court
of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County
 Florida. This action was filed on June 5
 2020
 against both the entity
and Mr. Edgar Ward. However
 the claim against Mr. Ward was later dropped. In the Amended Complaint filed on July 9
 2020
 Plaintiffs
demanded injunctive relief and damages for conversion
 fraudulent misrepresentation
 fraud in the inducement
 equitable accounting
 unjust
enrichment
 quantum meruit
 breach of contract
 and negligent misrepresentation. However
 please note that we obtained a dismissal of
this Amended Complaint on February 8
 2021
 based on the arbitration provision included in the written contract at issue between the
parties. At this time
 the Plaintiffs have not filed another court action that we are aware of. We are also not yet aware of any arbitration
initiated by the Plaintiff. The claim asserted that the Company failed to comply with the confidentiality imposed by a non-disclosure
agreement signed by Plaintiff and Defendant. Plaintiff claims that Defendant proceeded with the development of a hand sanitizer product
that was first revealed to Defendant by the Plaintiff
 however
 Defendant asserts that the product produced was different (gel vs. spray)
and that Defendant had contemplated developing the product (the Covid 19 pandemic was already underway) well in advance of the signing
of the NDA. The claim was dismissed in February 2021.

Ortiz
 Jose Ortiz v. Nutralife Biosciences
 Inc. f/k/a Nutrafuels
 Inc.
 Case No. CACE-29-017957
 was filed in the Circuit
Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County
 Florida
 on October 28
 2020. In this matter
 Mr. Ortiz is seeking
a judgment for damages
 attorneys&rsquo; fees
 and other costs relating to Defendant&rsquo;s purported breach of an employment agreement
dated March 18
 2015. We do not believe that this claim is valued at greater than $5
000. Ortiz&rsquo; claim was filed on October 28
2020
 asserting improper discharge from employment
 and failure to pay wages and benefits
 however
 we believe (and have filed summary
judgment asserting) that the claim was filed too late
 in contravention of the applicable statute of limitations.

Market
for Common Stock

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Limited Information Tier of OTC Markets under the symbol
 &ldquo;NLBS.&rdquo; We
are currently labeled as &ldquo;Delinquent SEC Reporting&rdquo; and have a red yield sign next to our name on OTC Markets because
the Company has not filed all of its required periodic reports since we filed our Quarterly Report for the Quarter ended September 30
2020
 which was filed with the SEC on May 12
 2021. We believe that filing this Form 10-K
 and subsequently filing our Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended March 31
 2021
 will bring us current with our reporting obligations with the SEC so that our profile on OTC Markets
can be updated accordingly to reflect Current Information and remove the yield sign as well as the &ldquo;Delinquent SEC Reporting&rdquo;
label. However
 there can be no assurance that we&rsquo;ll be able to accomplish the foregoing as planned or at all. Our common stock
shares were quoted with the symbol &ldquo;NTFU&rdquo; on the OTC Markets from May 19
 2014 until March 5
 2019. Trading in stocks quoted
on the OTC Markets is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little
to do with a company&rsquo;s operations or business prospects. On June 23
 2021
 the closing price of our common stock on the
OTC Pink was $0.13 per share.

OTC
Markets securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead
 OTC Markets securities
transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Markets issuers are traditionally
smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.

Set
forth below are the range of high and low prices for our common stock from the OTC Markets Pink Tier for the periods indicated. The quotations
reflect inter-dealer prices
 without retail mark-up
 mark-down or commissions and may not necessarily represent actual transactions:

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Historically
the Company&rsquo;s primary cash needs have been related to working capital items
 which the Company has largely funded through our revenues
working capital
 cash on hand
 and proceeds from the issuance of stock.

Cash
Flow Activities

As
of December 31
 2020
 the Company had a cash balance of $742.

Failure
to successfully continue to grow operational revenues could harm our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. We face all of the risks inherent in a new business
 including the need for significant additional capital
 management&rsquo;s
potential underestimation of initial and ongoing costs
 and potential delays and other problems in connection with establishing sales
channels.

We
are continuing our plan to further grow and expand operations and seek sources of capital to pay our contractual obligations as they
come due. Management believes that its current operating strategy will provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern
as long as we are able to obtain additional financing; however
 there is no assurance this will occur. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

Operating
Activities

Our
cash decreased $14
086 for the year ended December 31
 2020. Cash used in operating activities is net loss adjusted for certain
non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities
 such as those included in working capital.

For
the year ended December 31
 2020
 the Company&rsquo;s operating activities used cash of $1
284
240
 compared to the year ended December
31
 2019 which used cash of $2
934
441. For details of the operating cash flows refer to the consolidated statements of cash
flows in Part I &ndash; Financial Information.

Financing
Activities

During
year ended December 30
 2020
 we received an aggregate of $254

 under the Paycheck Protection Program and CARES
act.



040 from financing from debt and
$125

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates


In
preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.
GAAP)
 we have adopted various accounting policies. Our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the financial
statements.

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions
 including those related to the ability to
continue as going concern
 legal proceedings
 the recoverability of inventory
 long-lived assets
 the fair value of stock-based compensation
and the fair value of warrant liabilities are updated as appropriate
 which in most cases is at least quarterly. We base our estimates
on historical experience
 or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the
basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expenses. Actual results may materially differ
from these estimates.

Estimates
are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters
that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made
 and (2) other materially different estimates could have been reasonably
made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Our critical accounting estimates include
the following:

Revenue
Recognition:
 we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 services have been rendered or product
delivery has occurred
 the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is reasonably assured. Provision
for sales returns will be estimated based on the Company&rsquo;s historical return experience.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: 
are comprised of balances due from customers net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. In determining collectability
 historical
trends are evaluated and specific customer issues are reviewed to arrive at appropriate allowances.

Long-Lived
Assets:
that may suggest impairment. If indicators of impairment are present
 we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows attributable to the long-lived asset in question is less than its carrying amount. If less
 we measure the amount of the impairment
based on the amount that the carrying value of the impaired asset exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
eventual disposal of the impaired assets.



    
    



Derivative
Financial Instrument: 
 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts
or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be accounted for. The result of this accounting treatment is that
under certain circumstances the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability.
In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value measurement is recorded in the statement of operations
as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of the convertible note containing an embedded derivative instrument is marked
to fair value at the conversion date and that the fair value is reclassified to equity. The shares issued upon conversion of this note
are recorded at their fair value with a gain or loss recognition as applicable.

Equity
instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under this accounting standard are reclassified
to liabilities at the fair value of the instruments on the reclassification date/

Share-Based
Compensation: 
 Stock Compensation. FASB ASC 718 requires that
the cost resulting from all share-based transactions are recorded in the financial statements over the respective service periods. It
establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply
a fair-value-based measurement in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. FASB ASC 718 also establishes fair
value as the measurement objective for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services from non-employees in share-based payment
transactions.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We
have not entered into any transaction
 agreement or other contractual arrangement with an entity unconsolidated with us under whom we
have:



    
    
An
    obligation under a guarantee contract.

    
    
A
    retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit
    liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets.

    
    
Any
    obligation
 including a contingent obligation
 under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument.

    
    
Any
    obligation
 including a contingent obligation
 arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by us
    and material to us where such entity provides financing
 liquidity
 market risk or credit risk support to
 or engages in leasing
    hedging or research and development services with us.


We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have a current or future effect on its financial condition
 changes
in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures
 or capital resources that is material
other than those which may be disclosed in this Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the audited Consolidated

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
NutraLife
Biosciences
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NutraLife Biosciences
 Inc. (formerly known as NutraFuels
 Inc.) and Subsidiaries
(the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31
 2020 and 2019
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo;
equity and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;).
In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company at December
31
 2020 and 2019
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Going
Concern

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As disclosed in the
financial statements
 the Company has suffered substantial net losses in recent years
 has negative working capital and has an accumulated
deficit at December 31
 2020 and 2019 and is dependent on debt and equity financing to fund its operations
 all of which raise substantial
doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans regarding these matters are disclosed
in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error
or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical
Audit Matters

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the board of directors and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging
 subjective
 or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

NOTE
2 &ndash; BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis
of Presentation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;)
in the United States of America (&ldquo;U.S.&rdquo;) as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;)
Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) and with the rules and regulations of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission
(&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;).

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Precision Analytic Testing
LLC
 NutraDerma Technologies
 Inc.
 PhytoChem Technologies
 Inc.
 and TransDermalRX
 Inc. We operate as one reportable segment. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2016-13&rdquo;)
 which requires an entity to assess impairment of its financial instruments
based on its estimate of expected credit losses. Since the issuance of ASU 2016-13
 the FASB released several amendments to improve
and clarify the implementation guidance. In November 2019
 the FASB issued ASU 2019-10
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
(Topic 326)
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)
 and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates&rdquo;
 which amended the effective date
of the various topics. As the Company is a smaller reporting company
 the provisions of ASU 2016-13 and the related amendments are
effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2022 (quarter ending March
31
 2023 for the Company). Entities are required to apply these changes through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company will evaluate the impact of ASU
2016-13 on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements in a future period closer to the date of adoption.


    
    



In
December 2019
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (&ldquo;ASU 2019-12&rdquo;)
which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general
principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This guidance is effective
for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2020
 (quarter ended March 31
 2021). The
adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

In
August 2020
 the FASB issued ASU 2020-06
 &ldquo;Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity&rsquo;s Own Equity
&rdquo;
which simplifies and clarifies certain calculation and presentation matters related to convertible equity and debt instruments. Specifically
ASU-2020-06 removes requirements to separately account for conversion features as a derivative under ASC Topic 815 and removing the requirement
to account for beneficial conversion features on such instruments. Accounting Standards Update 2020-06 also provides clearer guidance
surrounding disclosure of such instruments and provides specific guidance for how such instruments are to be incorporated in the calculation
of Diluted EPS. The guidance under ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2021
 including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
 but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. The Company
will adopt this standard using a modified retrospective approach effective January 1
 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the effects
of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued
 but not yet effective
 accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Cash


The
Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts
 which
 at times
 may exceed federally insured limits. The Company did not have cash
balances in excess of FDIC insured limits at December 31
 2020 and December 31
 2019.



Inventories
are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value utilizing the weighted average method of valuation and consist of raw materials and
finished goods. The Company reduces inventory on hand to its net realizable value on an item-by-item basis when it is apparent that the
expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost. A charge to cost of sales results when the estimated net
realizable value of specific inventory items declines below cost. Management regularly reviews the Company&rsquo;s inventories for such
declines in value. Inventory consists of the following:

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

We
establish the existence of bad debts through a review of several factors including historical collection experience
 current aging status
of the customer accounts
 and financial condition of our customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is $0 and $1
500 as of December
31
 2020 and December 31
 2019
 respectively


    
    


The
activity for the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

Property
and Equipment 

All
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives
 generally three
 seven and twelve years
using the straight-line method. Upon sale or retirement
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from their respective
accounts
 and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. Repairs and maintenance charges
 which do not increase
the useful lives of the assets
 are charged to operations as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful
lives or the remaining term of the lease
 whichever is shorter.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

A
long-lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value amount may not
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
resulting from its use and eventual disposition. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived
assets exceeds its fair value.

Impairment
charges would be included with costs and expenses in the Company&rsquo;s condensed consolidated statements of operations and would result
in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on the Company&rsquo;s condensed consolidated balance sheets. No adjustments were made
to long-lived assets during the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 respectively.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company accounts for revenue under the guidance of FASB ASC 606
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts from Customers&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 606&rdquo;).

ASC
606 prescribes a five-step model that focuses on transfer of control and entitlement to payment when determining the amount of revenue
to be recognized. Under the new guidance
 an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with
a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

The
Company generates revenues from the sale of products. The product is invoiced
 and the revenue is recognized upon shipment or once transfer
of risk has passed to the customer
 which is the point at which the Company has satisfied its performance obligation.

Payments
received in advance from customers are recorded as customer deposits until earned
 at which time revenue is recognized.

We
recognize certain revenues under bill and hold arrangements with certain customers when the Company has fulfilled all of its performance
obligations
 the units are segregated for the specific customer only
 and the goods are ready for physical transfer to the customer in
accordance with their defined contract delivery schedule. For any requested bill and hold arrangement
 we make an evaluation as to whether
the bill and hold arrangement qualifies for revenue recognition. The customer must initiate the request for the bill and hold arrangement.
The customer must make a fixed commitment to purchase the items. The risk of ownership is passed to the customer
 and payment terms are
not modified.


    
    



The
Company&rsquo;s revenues accounted for under ASC 606 do not require significant estimates or judgements based on the nature of the Company&rsquo;s
revenue. The Company&rsquo;s contracts do not include multiple performance obligations or variable consideration. All of the Company&rsquo;s
sales resulted from contracts with customers for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019.

Shipping
and Handling Costs

Shipping
and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales. Billings for shipping and handling are reflected within sales
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Income
Taxes 

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10
 &ldquo;Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions.&rdquo; When tax returns are filed
it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others are subject
to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance
with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which
based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination
including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more
than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the
taxing authorities upon examination.

The
tax years 2017-2020 for the Company remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit or any notifications from
the IRS for any of the open tax years.

Net
Loss Per Share

Basic
loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing the loss attributable to stockholders by the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts
to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that shared in the earnings
of the Company. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the loss available to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding for the year and dilutive potential shares outstanding unless consideration of such dilutive potential shares would result
in anti-dilution. The following warrants and convertible notes were excluded from the computation of net loss per share.

Related
Party Transactions

All
transactions with related parties are in the normal course of operations and are measured at the exchange amount.



On
January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted FASB ASU 2016-02
 &ldquo;Leases&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 842&rdquo;) and other associated standards
 which
defines a lease as any contract that conveys the right to use a specific asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. ASC
842 requires the recognition of the right-of-use assets and related operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
the disclosure of key information about certain leasing arrangements. As permitted by ASC 842
 the Company elected the adoption date
of January 1
 2019
 which is the initial date of application. As a result
 the consolidated balance sheet prior to January 1
 2019 was
not restated. Under ASC 842
 all leases are required to be recorded on the balance sheet and are classified as either operating leases
or finance leases (formerly called capital leases). The lease classification affects the expense recognition in the income statement.
Operating lease charges are recorded entirely in operating expenses. Finance lease charges are split
 where amortization of the right-of-use
asset is recorded in operating expenses and an implied interest component is recorded in interest expense.

Leases
are classified as a finance lease if any of the following criteria are met:



    
    
The
    lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.

    
    
The
    lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.

    
    
The
    lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset.

    
    
The
    present value of the sum of lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee equals or exceeds substantially all of
    the fair value of the underlying asset.

    
    
The
    underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease
    term.


For
any leases that do not meet the criteria identified above for finance leases
 the Company treats such leases as operating leases. As
of December 30
 2020
 the Company has two finance leases and three operating leases.

Under
the new guidance
 both finance and operating leases are reflected on the balance sheet as lease or &ldquo;right-of -use&rdquo; assets
and lease liabilities. There are some exceptions
 which the Company has elected in its accounting policies. For leases with terms of
twelve months or less
 or below the Company&rsquo;s general capitalization policy threshold
 the Company elects an accounting policy
to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for all asset classes. The Company recognizes lease expense for such leases generally
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The
Company determines if a contract is a lease at the inception of the arrangement. The Company reviews all options to extend
 terminate
or purchase its right-of-use assets at the inception of the lease and accounts for these options when they are reasonably certain to
be exercised. Certain leases contain non-lease components
 such as common area maintenance
 which are generally accounted for separately.
In general
 the Company will assess if non-lease components are fixed and determinable
 or variable
 when determining if the component
should be included in the lease liability. For purposes of calculating the present value of the lease obligations
 the Company utilizes
the implicit interest rate within the lease agreement when known and/or determinable
 and otherwise utilizes its incremental borrowing
rate at the time of the lease agreement. The related right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost
 which primarily comprises of the
initial amount of the lease liability.

Lease
expense for operating leases consists of the lease payments plus any initial direct costs and is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. Included in lease expense are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial
lease liability. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis over
the lease term and interest expense determined on an amortized cost basis. The lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the
lease liability and interest expense.

Intangible
Asset

Intangible
asset represents the value assigned to intellectual property and is amortized based on the economic benefit expected to be realized.

NOTE
3 - LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS

Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We sustained significant losses and negative cash flows from operations.
We incurred a net loss of approximately $2.9 and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 respectively. We
had cash used in operating activities of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31
 2020
 and have an accumulated deficit
of approximately $41.7 million at December 31
 2020. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern.


    
    



In
December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in China
 and began to spread around the world
in early 2020. In reaction to decreased supply of and increased demand for sanitizer products
 the Company shifted its manufacturing
to produce sanitizer products. The Company&rsquo;s other business operations have been impacted negatively by COVID-19 due to government
restrictions and the overall adverse effect on the global economy. The Company expects COVID-19 to continue to negatively impact its
operating results and its ability to obtain financing.

The
Company is currently in the process of raising capital to complete and finalize the build-out of its facility in Deerfield Beach for
the purpose of consolidating its operations. The structure of the capital raise is currently in development. The Company is continuing
its path to profitability through increased business development
 marketing and sales of the Company&rsquo;s multiple lines of topical
ingestible and skincare health and wellness products. The Company is also focused on completing an efficacy clinical study on its patented
mosquito bug patch with plans upon a successful conclusion to launch globally in the very near future
 adding to the Company&rsquo;s
suite of wellness products.

The
independent auditors&rsquo; report on our financial statements for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019 contain explanatory paragraphs
expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

Failure
to successfully continue to grow operational revenues could harm our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. We face all of the risks inherent in a new business
 including the need for significant additional capital
 management&rsquo;s
potential underestimation of initial and ongoing costs
 and potential delays and other problems in connection with establishing sales
channels.

We
are continuing our plan to further grow and expand operations and seek sources of capital to pay our contractual obligations as they
come due. Management believes that its current operating strategy will provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern
as long as we are able to obtain additional financing; however
 there is no assurance this will occur. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE
6 &ndash; INVESTMENT

On
November 2
 2020 in connection with a manufacturing
 distribution and sales agreement with a third party distributor (the &ldquo;Distributor&rdquo;)
the Company issued 12.5 million of its common shares for 250 shares of non-trading convertible preferred stock of the Distributor. Each
convertible preferred share is convertible into 1
000 shares of the Distributor&rsquo;s common stock. The Distributor&rsquo;s common
shares are currently traded in the over the counter market. On the first business day following the 180-day anniversary of closing
 if
the share price of the Distributor is less than $4.00
 the Distributor will provide the Company its common stock valued at $1 million
less 250
000 common shares
 for no additional consideration. On the one-year anniversary of closing
 if the share price of the Distributor
is less than $4.00
 the Distributor will provide the Company its common stock valued at $1 million
 less 250
000 shares
 less the number
of shares provided on the 181st day anniversary
 for no additional consideration.

The
Company determined to initially value the convertible preferred stock investment using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the
following inputs: stock price: $4.00
 exercise price: $4.00
 expected term: one year
 and risk free rate 0.17%.

The
Company made this investment to realize strategic benefits for its business
 rather than to generate income or capital gains. Because
the Company owns less than 20% on an as converted basis of the Distributor
 and cannot exercise significant influence over operating
and financial policies of the Distributor
 the Company accounts for the investment under ASC 321
 &ldquo;Equity Securities&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC
321&rdquo;). Under ASC 321
 for each reporting period
 the Company completes a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators
to evaluate whether the investment is impaired.

The
investment balance as of December 31
 2020 is $383
326. There is no impairment recorded for the year ended December 31
2020.

 Related Parties

In
the fourth quarter of 2019
 the Company received proceeds aggregating $455
000 in connection with multiple short-term convertible promissory
notes that were amended to be due in November and December of 2020. The notes bear interest at 10% - 12% for the term of the note. Each
noteholder has the right to convert all the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest to the Company&rsquo;s common stock at
a price ranging from $0.085 to $0.10 per share. Additionally
 an aggregate of 3
222
800 warrants were issued to the noteholders.
722
800 of these warrants are exercisable at $0.30 per share and expired one year from the date of each respective note but were extended
for an additional year. 2
500
000 of these warrants are exercisable at $0.10 per share and expired one year from the date of each respective
note but were extended for an additional year. These notes are currently in default

Additionally
418
000 shares were issued to certain note holders as additional consideration.

During
the quarter ended March 31
 2020
 the Company received proceeds aggregating $345
000 in connection with multiple short-term promissory
notes with due dates ranging from February to June 2020. The notes had interest at 0% to 12% for the terms of the notes. Each noteholder
had the right to convert all the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest to the Company&rsquo;s common stock at a price ranging
from $0.085 to $0.10 per share
 prior to the maturity date. Additionally
 an aggregate of 3
250
000 shares were issued
to the noteholders as additional consideration. The notes also included a beneficial conversion feature (BCF). These notes are currently
in default.

During
the quarter ended September 30
 2020
 the Company received proceeds aggregating $230
000 in connection with multiple short-term promissory
notes each with a term of one year
 maturing in August or September 2021. The notes bear interest at 18%. Four of the five notes were
issued under a subscription agreement whereby in addition to the promissory note
 the note holder is offered up to four shares of common
stock for each one dollar of principal amount of the note at a price of $0.0001 per share. Under the subscription agreement
 a total
of 780
000 shares were issued.

During
the quarter ended December 31
 2020
 the Company received proceeds aggregating $330
040 in connection with multiple short-term promissory
notes each with a term of one year
 maturing in October through December 2021. The notes bear interest at 10% to 18%. Each note was issued
under a subscription agreement whereby in addition to the promissory note
 the note holder is offered up to four shares of common stock
for each one dollar of principal amount of the note at a price of $0.0001 per share. Under the subscription agreement
 a total of 520
000
shares were issued. Additionally
 an aggregate of 6
800
000 warrants were issued to five of the noteholders as additional consideration.
The warrants are exercisable at $0.08 per share and expire three years from the date of each respective note.

The
common stock and warrants to purchase common stock issued to the noteholders were treated as debt discounts. The gross proceeds of the
notes were allocated to debt and common shares issued on a relative far value basis.

The
debt discounts associated with the BCF
 warrants
 and common stock issuances are amortized through the earlier of the conversion of the
notes into common stock
 or the maturity date of the notes
 on a straight-line basis which approximates the effective interest method
due to the short-term nature of the notes. Amortization of the debt discount is reported as finance costs in the Statement of Operations.


    
    



The
Company allocated $106
280 of the gross proceeds of the 2019 notes to the stock issuances
 on a relative fair value basis
 which has
been recorded as a debt discount.

The
Company allocated $247
800 of the gross proceeds of the 2019 notes to the warrants
 on a relative fair value basis. In addition
because the effective conversion prices of the 2019 notes were less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the
issuance date
 the Company allocated $127
900
 the intrinsic value of that beneficial conversion feature
 to additional paid-in capital.

The
warrants&rsquo; relative fair value was calculated using the Black-Scholes Merton valuation model with the following inputs: an expected
and contractual life of twelve months
 an assumed volatility of 154.8%
 zero dividend rate
 and a risk free rate of 2.50%. The 2019 warrants
are classified in equity as additional paid-in capital.

The
Company allocated $314
100 of the gross proceeds of the 2020 convertible notes to the stock issuances and $75
200 of the gross proceeds
of the subscription agreement notes to the stock issuances on a relative fair value basis
 which has been recorded as a debt discount.
Total amortization associated with stock issuances debt discount was $473
390 and $72
166 for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
respectively.

The
Company allocated $143
900 of the gross proceeds of the subscription agreement notes to the warrants on a relative fair basis. The warrants&rsquo;
relative fair value was calculated using the Black-Scholes Merton valuation model with the following inputs: an expected and contractual
life of 36 months
 as assumed volatility of 189.9%
 zero dividend rate
 and a risk free rate of 0.17% - 0.22%. The warrants are classified
in equity as additional paid-in capital.

Because
the effective conversion prices of the convertible notes were less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the issuance
date
 the Company allocated $51
900
 the intrinsic value of that beneficial conversion feature
 to additional paid-in capital.

Total
amortization associated with the beneficial conversion feature and warrants debt discounts were $195
762 and $231
839 for the years ended
December 31
 2020 and 2019
 respectively.

As
of December 31
 2020 and 2019
 convertible notes payable to related parties
 net of discounts totaled $1
796
560 and $1
164
039
respectively
 and other notes payable to related parties
 net of discounts
 totaled $356
838 and $0
 respectively.

Convertible
Notes Payable to Shareholders

In
March 2019
 the Company received proceeds of $200
000 from a shareholder
 pursuant to a short-term promissory note payable
 bearing interest
at an annual rate of 3%
 due April 20
 2019. On April 1
 2019
 the note and accrued interest were satisfied by converting to 2
352
941
shares common stock at $0.085 per share.

In
June 2019
 the Company entered into an Investment Agreement that included a secured convertible 5.75% promissory note payable for $1
000
000
with a shareholder. The note is subject to a security agreement whereby the first four Ennea Processors the Company has committed to
commercialize and monetize will be secured as collateral for the note as well as current and future assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The payment terms of the note are interest only payments from July 7
 2019 through December 7
 2019 and commencing January 7
 2020
 the
Company was to make equal monthly installment payments that include principal and interest through the Maturity Date of December 7
 2020.

Included
in the Investment Agreement is a royalty agreement whereby the investor received 500
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and
will be entitled to a royalty of 8.5% from the revenue generated from the &ldquo;collateral processors&rdquo; while the principal is
outstanding and 5% thereafter on the first two collateral processors for a period of 10 years.

These
500
000 shares of common stock were valued at $95
500 using the trading price on the date of the agreement and was treated as a debt
discount
 amortized over the term of the note on a straight-line basis. Amortization associated with this debt discount was $63
664 and
$31
836 for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019.



    
    


In
addition to the collateral
 the note is secured by a Pledge Agreement from a related-party that included a mortgage lien on certain real
property as additional collateral. As compensation for providing the additional collateral
 the pledgor received 500
000 shares of the
Company&rsquo;s common stock. Pursuant to the agreement
 the Company will also make monthly payments equal to the interest paid on the
note commencing on December 5
 2019
 and 8.5% of the revenue generated from the collateral processors while the principal is outstanding
and 5% thereafter on the first two machines commercialized or monetized by the company.

Collateral
processors are not yet in service. Therefore
 revenue generated from them and the related royalties due cannot be estimated at this time
and will be expensed as incurred in the future.

The
500
000 shares of common stock issued as compensation for providing additional collateral were also valued at $95
000 using the trading
price on the day of the agreement and was treated as a prepaid expense
 amortized over the term of the note on a straight-line basis.
Amortization associated with this consideration was $63
664 and $31
836 for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019.

The
Company is currently in default of this note
 however
 the parties are in negotiation to reach settlement terms.

of the note were as follows:




    
    
No
    payments during the deferral period

    2020.

    
    
Commencing
    one month after the expiration of the deferral period
 and continuing the same day of each month thereafter until the maturity date
    the Company shall pay to the (&ldquo;Lender&rdquo;)
 monthly payments of principal and interest
 each in such equal amount required
    to fully amortize the principal amount outstanding on the note on the last day of the deferral period by the maturity date (twenty-four
    months from the date of the note
 or April 23
 2022).

    
    
On
    the maturity date
 the Company shall pay the Lender all unpaid principal plus accrued and unpaid interest plus interest accrued during
    the deferral period.

    
    
Payments
    shall be allocated among principal and interest at the discretion of Lender unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law.
    Notwithstanding
 in the event the Loan
 or any portion thereof
 is forgiven pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the
    federal CARES Act
 the amount so forgiven shall be applied to principal.

    
    
The
    Company may prepay this note at any time without payment of any premium.

    
    
Interest
    shall be accrued at a rate of 1% per annum from the date the loan is funded through maturity. 



The
Lender is participating in the Paycheck Protection Program to help businesses impacted by the economic impact from COVID-19. Forgiveness
of this loan is only available for principal that is used for the limited purposes that qualify for forgiveness under the Small Business
Administration&rsquo;s (the &ldquo;SBA&rdquo;) requirements; and that to obtain forgiveness
 the Company must request it and must provide
documentation in accordance with the SBA requirements and certify that the amounts the Company is requesting to be forgiven qualify under
those requirements. The Company elected to treat the loan as debt under FASB ASC 470. As such
 the Company will derecognize the liability
when the loan is forgiven
 and the Company is legally released from the loan.

Principal
payments on this note are due as follows:



    
148
000

    
106
700

    
254
700



    
    



The
loan was forgiven on March 12
 2021.

In
February 2021
 the Company received additional proceeds from the Lender under the Paycheck Protection Program and CARES Act in the amount
of $243
275
 at an interest rate of 1% per annum. Similar terms apply. Forgiveness of the loan is dependent upon approval of the SBA

 there can be no assurance or
certainty that forgiveness will in fact occur.

NOTE
12 - INCOME TAXES

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax effects of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets
and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred
tax asset will not be realized.

The
components of income tax provision (benefit) related to continuing operations are as follows at December 31
 2020 and 2019:

The
change in valuation allowance was $543
000 and $413
000 for the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 respectively. We recorded a 100%
valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset for the loss from operations. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which temporary differences become deductible. The Company
has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $40.1 million as of December 31
 2020
 of which $32.6 million were incurred prior

 2017 do
not expire.

In
accordance with the provisions of ASC 740: Income Taxes
 we record a liability for uncertain tax positions when it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At December 31
 2020 and 2019
 we have no liabilities for uncertain
tax positions. We continually evaluate expiring statutes of limitations
 audits
 proposed settlements
 changes in tax law and new authoritative
rulings.


    
    




NOTE
13 - CONTINGENCIES

The
Company is subject to asserted claims and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company maintains insurance
policies to mitigate potential losses from these actions. In the opinion of management
 the amount of the ultimate liability with respect
to those actions will not materially affect the Company&rsquo;s financial position or results of operations.

In
June 2020
 a claim was filed against the Company for a breach of confidentiality imposed by a non-disclosure agreement signed by both
the Company and plaintiff. The claim was dismissed in February 2021.



In
August 2020
 a claim has been filed against the Company by its former attorney. The claim involves allegations that fees approximating
$150
000 charged for the calendar year 2019 were unpaid. The Company is vigorously contesting these claims and the outcome cannot be
determined at this time.

NOTE
14 - CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK:



The
Company maintains principally all cash balances with various financial institutions which
 at times
 may exceed the amount insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The exposure to the Company is solely dependent upon daily bank balances and the respective
strength of the financial institutions. The Company has not incurred any losses on these accounts. At both December 31
 2020 and 2019
amounts in excess of insured limits were $0.



For
the year ended December 31
 2020
 two customers accounted for approximately 28% of sales. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 four
customers accounted for 73% of sales.

NOTE
15 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In
December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in China
 and began to spread around the world
in early 2020. In reaction to decreased supply of and increased demand for sanitizer products
 the Company shifted its manufacturing
to produce sanitizer products. The Company&rsquo;s other business operations have been impacted negatively by COVID-19 due to government
restrictions and the overall adverse effect on the global economy. The Company expects COVID-19 to continue to negatively impact its
operating results and its ability to obtain financing.

In
January 2021
 the Company issued 15
000
000 warrants to its Chief Executive Officer
 President and sole Director and 7
500
000 warrants
to its Vice President as compensation. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.1025 and expire 3 years after issuance.

In
April 2021
 the Company issued 2
000
000 warrants to its Production Manager as compensation. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.1025
and expire 3 years after issuance.

In
January 2021
 the Company entered into a Note Exchange Agreement whereby a note holder of the Company agreed to exchange their current
note that was in default
 for a new promissory note and a warrant to acquire 1
200
000 shares of common stock. The warrant is exercisable
at $0.08 per share and expires three years from the date of the new promissory note.

In
January through March 2021
 the Company received proceeds of $215
000 in connection with multiple short-term promissory notes with due
dates ranging from January to March 2022. The notes bear interest at 10%. Additionally
 an aggregate of 8
600
000 warrants were issued
to the noteholders as additional consideration. The warrants are exercisable at $0.08 per share and expire three years from the date
of each respective note.

In
April through June 2021
 the Company issued 1
350
000 shares of common stock and 5
400
000 warrants in exchange for $108
000.
The warrants have an exercise price of $0.08 per share and expire 2 years after issuance.


    
    


Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Resignation
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

On
September 11
 2020
 Daszkal Bolton LLP (&ldquo;Daszkal&rdquo;) resigned its position as the independent registered public accounting
firm of the Company.

Daszkal
did not issue a report on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2019. Except as set forth herein
Daszkal&rsquo;s report on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2018 did not contain an adverse
opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty
 audit scope or accounting principles
 except
that such report expressed substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.

Furthermore
during the Company&rsquo;s two most recent fiscal years and through September 11
 2020
 there have been no disagreements with Daszkal
on any matter of accounting principles or practices
 financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure
 which disagreements
if not resolved to Daszkal&rsquo;s satisfaction
 would have caused Daszkal to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement
in connection with its reports on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements for such periods.

For
the fiscal years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 and through September 11
 2020
 there were no &ldquo;reportable events&rdquo; as that
term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

Engagement
of New Independent Registered Accounting Firm

On
September 16
 2020
 the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors appointed Rotenberg Meril Solomon Bertiger &amp; Guttilla
 P.C. (&ldquo;Rotenberg&rdquo;)
as the Company&rsquo;s new independent registered accounting firm. During the Company&rsquo;s two most recent fiscal years and through
September 16
 2020
 neither the Company nor anyone acting on the Company&rsquo;s behalf consulted Rotenberg with respect to any of the
matters or reportable events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
 we carried out an evaluation
 with the participation
of our management
 including our CEO and sole Director
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation
 our CEO concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in
the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our CEO as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure for the reasons discussed below.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Our internal
control system was designed to
 in general
 provide reasonable assurance to our management and board regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements
 but because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2020. The framework used by
management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled &ldquo;Internal Control &ndash; Integrated Framework&rdquo;
issued by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment
 our President and Chief
Financial Officer have determined and concluded that
 as of December 31
 2020
 our internal controls over financial reporting were not
effective. A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control our financial reporting as of December 31
2020
 we determined that the following items constituted a material weakness:



    
    
We
    do not have an independent audit committee in place
 which would provide oversight of our officers
 operations and financial reporting
    function;



    
    




    
    
We
    do not have anyone currently serving as our Chief Financial Officer;

    
    
Our
    accounting department
 which consists of a limited number of personnel
 does not provide adequate segregation of duties; and

    
    
We
    do not have effective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.


Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors
 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
 will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. Management plans to take action
and implementing improvements to our controls and procedures when our financial position permits.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the permanent
exemption of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management&rsquo;s report in this annual report.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No
change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report
 fourth quarter of
the fiscal year ended December 31
 2020
 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control
over financial reporting.

Item
9B. Other Information



PART
III

Item
10. Directors
 Executive Officers and Corporate Governance

The
board of directors elect our executive officers annually. A majority vote of the directors who are in office are required to fill vacancies.
Each director shall be elected for the term of one year
 and until his successor is elected and qualified
 or until his earlier resignation
or removal. Our directors and executive officers are as follows:



    
    
    
    
    

Edgar
    Ward
    
    
    
Chief
    Executive Officer
 President
 Director

Neil
    Catania 
    
    
    
Vice
    President


Edgar
Ward
 Chief Executive Officer
 President and Director

From
April 1
 2010 to present
 Edgar Ward has served as our Chief Executive Officer
 President
 and Director. Mr. Ward&rsquo;s services to
us include day to day operations of our manufacturing facility and management of our company.

As
our chief executive officer
 president and director Mr. Ward brings his experience in managing our day to day operations.

Neil
Catania
 Vice President

Neil
Catania became our Vice-President on November 20
 2012. From May 2004 until present
 Neil Catania has been the chief executive officer
of MND LLC
 a financial services company located in New York.


    
    


Mr.
Catania&rsquo;s services to us include assisting Mr. Ward with our day to day operations. Neil Catania holds Series 7
 Series 63
 Series
24 and Series 55 licenses from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;).

As
our Vice-President Mr. Catania brings his experience in the financial services industry and executive management to our day to day operations.

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings

No
executive officer
 member of the board of directors or control person of our Company has been involved in any legal proceeding listed
in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past 10 years.



We
do not have a standing nominating
 compensation or audit committee. Rather
 our sole director performs the functions of these committees.
Additionally
 because our common stock is not listed for trading or quotation on a national securities exchange
 we are not required
to have such committees.

Other
Directorships

None
of our other officers and directors are directors of other Securities and Exchange Commission reporting companies.

Conflicts
of Interest

Our
Chief Executive Officer
 President
 and sole Director
 Edgar Ward devotes his full time to our business under the terms of his employment
contract. Our only other executive officer
 Neal Catania is not obligated to commit his full time and attention to our business; accordingly
he may encounter a conflict of interest in allocating his time between our operations and those of other businesses. Neal Catania spends
on an average ten (10) hours each month to our business and is not contractually required to devote full time services to us. In the
future
 our officers and directors may engage in other business activities
 investments and business opportunities that may be appropriate
for presentation to us as well as other entities to which they owe a fiduciary duty. As a result
 they may have conflicts of interest
in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. Our officers and directors may also in the future
become affiliated with entities
 engaged in business activities similar to those we intend to conduct. In general
 officers and directors
of a corporation are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:



    
    
the
    corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;

    
    
the
    opportunity is within the corporation&rsquo;s line of business; and

    
    
it
    would be unfair to the corporation and its stockholders not to bring the opportunity to the attention of the corporation.


Code
of Ethics

We
have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our employees
 officers and directors
 including those officers responsible
for financial reporting. We plan to adopt a Code of Ethics in the future
 at the latest prior to our stock being listed on an exchange
that requires us to have a formal Code of Ethics.

Director
Independence

We
do not have any independent directors
 as such term is defined in the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market
 at this time. The
Company is not quoted on any exchange that requires director independence requirements. For purposes of determining director independence
we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15). See &ldquo;Directors
 Executive Officers and Corporate Governance&rdquo;&mdash;
&ldquo;Director Independence.&rdquo;


    
    


Family
Relationships



Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company&rsquo;s directors and officers
 and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered
class of the Company&rsquo;s equity securities
 to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of the Company&rsquo;s
securities with the SEC on Forms 3
 4 and 5. Officers
 directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulation to
furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

Based
solely on the Company&rsquo;s review of the copies of the forms received by it during the fiscal year ended December 31
 2020
 the Company
believes that all person who
 at any time during such fiscal year
 was a director
 officer or beneficial owner of more than 10% of the
Company&rsquo;s common stock failed to comply with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during such fiscal years.

Under
    the terms of his employment agreement
 Mr.
 Ward receives an annual salary of $250

000. For
    the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 Edgar Ward received $111

 respectively.

    
For
    the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019 Neil Catania received cash compensation of $15
000 and $0
 respectively.


Edgar
Ward is the sole member of our board of Directors. Mr. Ward is not compensated for his service as a director.

Our
board of directors determines the compensation paid to our executive officers based upon the years of service to us
 whether services
are provided on a full-time basis and the experience and level of skill required. Because Mr. Ward is our sole director
 he determines
his own compensation for his services as our Chief Executive Officer and President.

We
may award our officers and directors shares of common stock as non-cash compensation as determined by the board of directors from time
to time. The board will base its decision to grant common stock as compensation on the level of skill required to perform the services
rendered and time committed to providing services to us.

Outstanding
Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End

There
were no outstanding equity awards at the 2020 fiscal year-end.


    
    


Compensation
Plans

We
have not adopted any compensation plan to provide for future compensation of any of our directors or executive officers.

Employment
Agreements

On
January 13
 2017 we entered into an employment agreement with our President and CEO
 Edgar Ward. The term of this agreement began on

000 per year.

The
Company is not currently party to any other employment agreements.

Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

At
June 24
 2021
 we had 160
740
200 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding
 1
000 shares of our Series A Preferred
stock issued and outstanding
 and 20 shares of our Series B Preferred issued and outstanding. The following table sets forth information
regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock
 Series A Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock as of June 24
 2021
by:



    
    
each
    person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock;

    
    
    

    
    
each
    of our directors;

    
    
    

    
    
each
    of our named executive officers; and

    
    
    

    
    
our
    executive officers and directors as a group.


Unless
otherwise indicated
 the business address of each person listed is in care of the Company
 6601 Lyons Road
 Suite L-6
 Coconut Creek

owner&rdquo; of a security if that person has or shares &ldquo;voting power
&rdquo; which includes the power to vote or to direct the
voting of such security
 or &ldquo;investment power
&rdquo; which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such
security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has the right to acquire beneficial
ownership within 60 days. Under these rules more than one person may be deemed a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person
may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic interest.

Unless
otherwise indicated below
 to the best of our knowledge each beneficial owner named in the table has sole voting and sole investment
power with respect to all shares beneficially owned
 subject to community property laws where applicable.

Exhibit
4.15

Description
of Securities



Our
authorized capital stock consists of 499
990
000 shares of common stock
 par value $0.0001 per share and 10
000
000 shares of preferred
stock
 $0.0001 par value per share
 of which 160
740
200 shares of common stock are currently outstanding; and 1
000 shares of
Series A Preferred stock and 20 shares of Series B Preferred stock are currently outstanding.

Common
Stock

Each
holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share owned of record on all matters voted upon by shareholders
 and a majority
vote is required for actions to be taken by shareholders. The common stock has no preemptive rights
 no cumulative voting rights and
no redemption
 sinking fund or conversion provisions.

Preferred
Stock

The
Company is authorized to issue 10
000
000 shares of preferred stock
 $0.0001 par value per share and the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors
is authorized to establish
 from the authorized shares of preferred stock
 one or more classes or series of shares
 to designate each
such class and series
 and fix the rights and preferences of each such class of preferred stock
 which shall have voting powers
 preferences
participating
 optional or other special rights
 qualifications and limitations or restrictions as adopted by the Board of Directors
prior to the issuance of any such preferred shares. We have designated 1
000 shares of Series A Preferred and 110 shares of Series B
Preferred.

There
are currently 1
000 shares of Series A Preferred stock and 20 shares of Series B Preferred stock issued and outstanding.

Series
A Preferred

The
Series A Shares have the following rights and preferences:



    
    
Each
    one (1) share is entitled to 500
000 votes per share on all matters submitted to our common stockholders.

    
    
The
    Series A Shares are not convertible into common shares;

    
    
The
    holders of the Series A Shares are not entitled to receive dividends or any distribution upon our liquidation or dissolution;

    
    
The
    holders of the Series A Shares cannot assign or sell the shares; and

    
    
The
    Series A Shares are redeemable in whole by us for the price of $1
000 at the option of the holder.


So
long as any of the Series A Shares are outstanding
 we cannot take the following actions without the consent of the holders of 100% of
the Series A Shares: amend
 alter
 waive or repeal
 whether by merger consolidation
 combination
 reclassification or otherwise
 the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; or create
 authorize or issue any class
 series or shares of any class of capital stock. The rights
and preferences of the Series A Share cannot be amended without the consent of 100% of the holders of the Series A Shares.

Series
B Preferred

We
have designated one hundred and ten (110) shares of the preferred stock of the Company
 par value $0.0001 as Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock (the &ldquo;Series B Preferred Stock&rdquo;).

The
shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible at a rate of 1 share of Series B Preferred Stock to 149
567 shares of common stock
par value $0.0001 per share of the Company (the &ldquo;Common Stock&rdquo;). Holders of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company may convert
their shares of Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock at any time following January 1
 2021 (the &ldquo;Permitted Conversion Date&rdquo;).
The Series B Preferred Stock is subject to an ownership limitation
 pursuant to which no holder of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled
to convert such investor&rsquo;s shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock if such conversion would result in ownership
of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will vote together
with the holders of the Common Stock on any matter submitted to the shareholders of the Company. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock may convert
at the time such vote is made. The Series B Preferred Stock will participate in any dividends
 distributions or payments to the holders
of the Common Stock on an as-converted basis. The Series B Preferred Stock does not have any liquidation preference over the holders
of Common Stock of the Company. Once issued
 certain shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are redeemable at the election of the Company
at any time prior to the Permitted Conversion Date pursuant to a separate written agreement between the holders of the Series B Preferred
Stock and the Company.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;In July and September of 2019, the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;wholly owned subsidiary, Phytochem, entered into two separate lease agreements for office and warehouse space located in Onalaska, Wisconsin,&#13;that commenced on August 1 and October 1, respectively. Each lease is for six-month terms with four (4) renewal options to extend for&#13;six additional months.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, &amp;#8220;Financial&#13;Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-13&amp;#8221;), which&#13;requires an entity to assess impairment of its financial instruments based on its estimate of expected credit losses. Since the issuance&#13;of ASU 2016-13, the FASB released several amendments to improve and clarify the implementation guidance. In November 2019, the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2019-10, &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective&#13;Dates&amp;#8221;, which amended the effective date of the various topics. As the Company is a smaller reporting company, the provisions of&#13;ASU 2016-13 and the related amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after&#13;December 15, 2022 (quarter ending March 31, 2023 for the Company). Entities are required to apply these changes through a cumulative-effect&#13;adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company will&#13;evaluate the impact of ASU 2016-13 on the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements in a future period closer to the date of adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white&gt;In December 2019, the FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (&amp;#8220;ASU 2019-12&amp;#8221;), which is intended&#13;to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in&#13;Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years,&#13;and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, (quarter ended March 31, 2021). The adoption of this&#13;standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white&gt;In August 2020, the FASB&#13;issued ASU 2020-06, &amp;#8220;Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity&amp;#8217;s Own Equity,&amp;#8221; which simplifies&#13;and clarifies certain calculation and presentation matters related to convertible equity and debt instruments. Specifically, ASU-2020-06&#13;removes requirements to separately account for conversion features as a derivative under ASC Topic 815 and removing the requirement to&#13;account for beneficial conversion features on such instruments. Accounting Standards Update 2020-06 also provides clearer guidance surrounding&#13;disclosure of such instruments and provides specific guidance for how such instruments are to be incorporated in the calculation of Diluted&#13;EPS. The guidance under ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within&#13;those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company will&#13;adopt this standard using a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the effects&#13;of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable&#13;value utilizing the weighted average method of valuation and consist of raw materials and finished goods. The Company reduces inventory&#13;on hand to its net realizable value on an item-by-item basis when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item&#13;falls below its original cost. A charge to cost of sales results when the estimated net realizable value of specific inventory items declines&#13;below cost. Management regularly reviews the Company&amp;#8217;s inventories for such declines in value. Inventory consists of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of&#13;a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes&#13;it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes,&#13;if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition&#13;threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with&#13;the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described&#13;above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any&#13;associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2016-02,&#13;&amp;#8220;Leases&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASC 842&amp;#8221;) and other associated standards, which defines a lease as any contract that conveys the right&#13;to use a specific asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. ASC 842 requires the recognition of the right-of-use assets&#13;and related operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about certain leasing arrangements.&#13;As permitted by ASC 842, the Company elected the adoption date of January 1, 2019, which is the initial date of application. As a result,&#13;the consolidated balance sheet prior to January 1, 2019 was not restated. Under ASC 842, all leases are required to be recorded on the&#13;balance sheet and are classified as either operating leases or finance leases (formerly called capital leases). The lease classification&#13;affects the expense recognition in the income statement. Operating lease charges are recorded entirely in operating expenses. Finance&#13;lease charges are split, where amortization of the right-of-use asset is recorded in operating expenses and an implied interest component&#13;is recorded in interest expense.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;The Company determines if a contract is a lease at&#13;the inception of the arrangement. The Company reviews all options to extend, terminate, or purchase its right-of-use assets at the inception&#13;of the lease and accounts for these options when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Certain leases contain non-lease components,&#13;such as common area maintenance, which are generally accounted for separately. In general, the Company will assess if non-lease components&#13;are fixed and determinable, or variable, when determining if the component should be included in the lease liability. For purposes of&#13;calculating the present value of the lease obligations, the Company utilizes the implicit interest rate within the lease agreement when&#13;known and/or determinable, and otherwise utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at the time of the lease agreement. The related right-of-use&#13;asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, &amp;#8220;Financial&#13;Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-13&amp;#8221;), which&#13;requires an entity to assess impairment of its financial instruments based on its estimate of expected credit losses. Since the issuance&#13;of ASU 2016-13, the FASB released several amendments to improve and clarify the implementation guidance. In November 2019, the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2019-10, &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective&#13;Dates&amp;#8221;, which amended the effective date of the various topics. As the Company is a smaller reporting company, the provisions of&#13;ASU 2016-13 and the related amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after&#13;December 15, 2022 (quarter ending March 31, 2023 for the Company). Entities are required to apply these changes through a cumulative-effect&#13;adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company will&#13;evaluate the impact of ASU 2016-13 on the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements in a future period closer to the date of adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in&#13;Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years,&#13;and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, (quarter ended March 31, 2021).

Specifically, ASU-2020-06&#13;removes requirements to separately account for conversion features as a derivative under ASC Topic 815 and removing the requirement to&#13;account for beneficial conversion features on such instruments. Accounting Standards Update 2020-06 also provides clearer guidance surrounding&#13;disclosure of such instruments and provides specific guidance for how such instruments are to be incorporated in the calculation of Diluted&#13;EPS. The guidance under ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within&#13;those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company will&#13;adopt this standard using a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2022.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;All property and equipment are recorded at cost and&#13;depreciated over their estimated useful lives, generally three, seven and twelve years, using the straight-line method. Upon sale or retirement,&#13;the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included&#13;in the results of operations. Repairs and maintenance charges, which do not increase the useful lives of the assets, are charged to operations&#13;as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the lease, whichever is shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of&#13;a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes&#13;it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes,&#13;if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition&#13;threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with&#13;the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described&#13;above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any&#13;associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

ASC 842 requires the recognition of the right-of-use assets&#13;and related operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about certain leasing arrangements.&#13;As permitted by ASC 842, the Company elected the adoption date of January 1, 2019, which is the initial date of application. As a result,&#13;the consolidated balance sheet prior to January 1, 2019 was not restated. Under ASC 842, all leases are required to be recorded on the&#13;balance sheet and are classified as either operating leases or finance leases (formerly called capital leases). The lease classification&#13;affects the expense recognition in the income statement. Operating lease charges are recorded entirely in operating expenses. Finance&#13;lease charges are split, where amortization of the right-of-use asset is recorded in operating expenses and an implied interest component&#13;is recorded in interest expense.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;Under the new guidance, both finance and operating&#13;leases are reflected on the balance sheet as lease or &amp;#8220;right-of -use&amp;#8221; assets and lease liabilities. There are some exceptions,&#13;which the Company has elected in its accounting policies. For leases with terms of twelve months or less, or below the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;general capitalization policy threshold, the Company elects an accounting policy to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for&#13;all asset classes. The Company recognizes lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;The Company determines if a contract is a lease at&#13;the inception of the arrangement. The Company reviews all options to extend, terminate, or purchase its right-of-use assets at the inception&#13;of the lease and accounts for these options when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Certain leases contain non-lease components,&#13;such as common area maintenance, which are generally accounted for separately. In general, the Company will assess if non-lease components&#13;are fixed and determinable, or variable, when determining if the component should be included in the lease liability. For purposes of&#13;calculating the present value of the lease obligations, the Company utilizes the implicit interest rate within the lease agreement when&#13;known and/or determinable, and otherwise utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at the time of the lease agreement. The related right-of-use&#13;asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;Lease expense for operating leases consists of the&#13;lease payments plus any initial direct costs and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease expense&#13;are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial lease liability. Lease expense for finance&#13;leases consists of the amortization of the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense determined&#13;on an amortized cost basis. The lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed&#13;by dividing the loss attributable to stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per&#13;share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted&#13;into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that shared in the earnings of the Company. Diluted loss per share is computed&#13;by dividing the loss available to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year and dilutive potential&#13;shares outstanding unless consideration of such dilutive potential shares would result in anti-dilution. The following warrants and convertible&#13;notes were excluded from the computation of net loss per share.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman
