Iconic Brands is a beverage company that develops
 from inception to completion
 alcoholic beverages for itself and third parties. Iconic Brands also markets and places the products into national distribution through long standing industry relationships. Iconic is also a leader in &#8220;Celebrity Branding&#8221; of beverages
Bellissima Spirits LLC entered into a License Agreement with Christie Brinkley
 Inc. an entity owned by Christie Brinkley
 to use Brinkley&#8217;s endorsement
 signature
 and other intellectual property owned by Bellissima Spirits LLC. Bellissima by Christie Brinkley is a line of Organic Prosecco. The line includes a DOC Brut
 Sparkling Rose and a Zero Sugar
Bellissima Spirits LLC produces it products in Treviso
 Italy. The products are produced at a winery that has invested an enormous amount of time and financial resources to produce and deliver Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wines. We have a &#8220;one stop&#8221; shop with our winery partners and they manage all of the procurement of all raw materials required to produce a finished product of either the DOC Brut
 Sparkling Rose Pinot Grigio and our Zero Sugar
&#8221;)
 a variable interest entity of the Company
Our products are produced overseas and shipped to the United States by United Spirits
By law
 United Spirits can only sell our alcoholic products to a licensed United States wholesaler or distributor. Wholesalers and distributors then sell the product to licensed retailers for &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off&#8221; premise consumption. An &#8220;on&#8221; premise retailer is an establishment where the alcohol is consumed
 such as a bar or restaurant. An &#8220;off&#8221; premise retailer is an establishment where alcohol is sold for consumption elsewhere
 such as a liquor store or
 in some state jurisdictions
One of United Spirits&#8217; distributors
 Southern Glazer&#8217;s Wine and Spirits
 LLC
 purchased a $2.1 million order during the fourth quarter of 2017 for sales to Publix Supermarkets. The order was related to a holiday program
 and it was authorized for all of Publix&#8217;s seven markets: Florida
 Georgia
 Tennessee
 Alabama
 North Carolina
 South Carolina and Virginia. The program featured Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wines in all Publix stores for the 2017 holiday season. The brand also was featured as the &#8220;BOGO&#8221; (Buy One Get One) brand in Publix's circular that ran in early January 2018. As a condition of being included in the promotion
 the Company was required to provide a $597
138 rebate for each product sold during this promotion. Note
 we do not sell directly to Publix or any retail licensee. All of our sales must be made through United Spirits to wholesalers and distributors
We intend to seek
 investigate and
 if such investigation warrants
The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality
 price
 brand recognition and distribution strength. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases
 as well as shelf space in retail stores
 restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products
 some of which have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors include La Marca Prosecco owned by Gallo
 Mionetto and a large number of independent small importers with a significant number of competitive products. We also compete with Diageo
 the largest drinks company in the world
 and others such as Constellation Brands
With the release of our new line of Aperitis
The production and sale of wine is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury
In addition
 most states in which our wines are sold impose varying excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages. Prompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse
 government entities often consider legislation that could potentially affect the taxation of alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates being considered are often substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation
 if passed
 cannot be assessed accurately. Any increase in the taxes imposed on wines can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products. However
The agreements we have in place with United Spirits and Dan Kay International provide the required licensing conduits that allow us to capture the sales relative to alcoholic beverages in the United States. The United States alcohol beverage business is based upon what is known as a &#8220;three-tier system.&#8221; The three tiers consist of an import or supplier tier if the product is domestically produced. The second tier is the wholesale tier. The third tier is known as the retail tier
As of the date hereof
 we have one operations employee in addition to our officers and directors Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis
As a smaller reporting company
 we are not required to provide a statement of risk factors. Nonetheless
Any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following information
 together with the other information contained in this Annual Report
 before you decide to buy our common stock. If one or more of the following events actually occurs
 our business will suffer
 and as a result our financial condition or results of operations will be adversely affected. In this case
 the market price
 if any
 of our common stock could decline
Currently
 our focus is on the production and distribution of our alcoholic beverages. We face risks in selling our current products and in developing new product candidates and eventually bringing them to market. We also face risks that our business model may become obsolete. The following risks are material risks that we face. If any of these risks occur
 our business
 our ability to achieve revenues
We face inventory risk
 and if it fails to predict accurately demand for products
We are exposed to inventory risks that may adversely affect operating results as a result of new product launches
 changes in product cycles and pricing
 limited shelf-life of certain of our products
 changes in consumer demand
 and other factors. We endeavor to predict accurately
 based on information from retailers and reasonable assumptions
 the expected demand for our products in order to avoid excessive inventory. Demand for products
 however
We are exposed to production risks
 especially in the case of Bellissima Prosecco and Sparking Wines due to weather conditions. The growing and harvest of the grapes we need to make our wines are directly affected by the weather. Adverse weather conditions would decrease the availability of grapes
 increase the cost of grapes
We produce our wines at two production facilities: one in Sicily
 Italy (BiVi) and another in Treviso
We have a history of losses
We have had a limited number of quarters or years of profitability and historically raised additional capital to meet its growth needs. Our losses from operations and our inability to raise sufficient working capital have resulted in negative equity and working capital positions as shown on our Balance Sheets at December 31
We expect to make significant investments in order to develop and expand our business
 which
 we believe
 will result in additional sales
 marketing and general and administrative expenses that will require increased sales to recover these additional costs. Once we become a fully reporting company
 we expect to continue to incur legal
 accounting
The wine industry is intensely competitive. Our wines compete in several super-premium and ultra-premium wine market segments with many other super-premium and ultra-premium domestic and foreign wines
 with imported wines coming from the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions of France
 as well as Italy
 Chile
 Argentina
 South Africa and Australia. Our wines also compete with other alcoholic and
 to a lesser degree
 non-alcoholic beverages
 for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by independent distributors
 many of which carry extensive brand portfolios. As a result of this intense competition there has been and may continue to be upward pressure on selling and promotional expenses. In addition
 the wine industry has experienced significant consolidation. Many competitors have greater financial
 technical
 marketing and public relations resources. Our sales may be harmed to the extent we are not able to compete successfully against such wine or alternative beverage producers&#8217; costs. There can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to successfully compete with current competitors or that we will not face greater competition from other wineries
Our agreements with direct retail partners are informal and therefore subject to change. If one or more of the direct retail partners chose to purchase fewer products
 or we are forced to reduce the prices
We will need additional funding in the future
 and if we are unable to raise capital when needed
 we may be forced to delay
 reduce or eliminate our product candidate development programs
 commercial efforts
We may intend to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings and may also use debt financings or strategic collaboration and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities
 our shareholders may experience additional dilution
 and debt financing
 if available
 may involve restrictive covenants and may result in high interest expense. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements
 it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our product candidates
 processes and technologies or our development projects or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms
 or at all. If adequate funds are not available from the foregoing sources
 we may consider additional strategic financing options
 including sales of assets
 or we may be required to delay
 reduce the scope of
 or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or curtail some of our commercialization efforts of our operations. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable
From time to time
 we may consider possible strategic transactions
 including the potential acquisitions or licensing of products or technologies or acquisition of companies
 and other alternatives with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. We may never complete a strategic transaction
 and in the event that we do complete a strategic transaction
 implementation of such transactions may impair shareholder value or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges and may pose significant integration challenges and/or management and business disruptions
We are highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer. We will continue to depend on his industry experience. At this time
We distribute our products through an entity wholly-owned and controlled by our Chief Executive Officer and if he were to leave
We have entered into a Distribution Agreement with United Spirits
&#8221;) for United Spirits to distribute and wholesale our products and to act as the licensed importer and wholesaler. The Distribution Agreement provides United Spirits the exclusive right through 2025 to sell our products for an agreed distribution fee equal to $1.00 per case of product sold. United Spirits is owned and managed by Richard DeCicco
 our controlling shareholder
 President
 CEO
United Spirits is a variable interest entity of the Company. Because we are the primary beneficiary of United Spirits
 United Spirits&#8217; assets
 liabilities and operations have been consolidated in our financial statements. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December
 2018 and 2017. However
We have entered into Registration Rights Agreements with certain shareholders described in further detail in our latest Prospectus (filed on February 1
 2019
&#8221; on page 14. If we cannot meet certain obligations under this agreement
The Registration Rights Agreement required us to file an initial registration statement by June 8
 2018
 but we filed the initial registration statement on September 19
 2018. While we have a verbal agreement with these shareholders to extend the filing deadline in the Registration Rights Agreement
 these shareholders may seek to enforce their rights to partial liquidated damages. If this were to occur
 we would be forced to pay back part of the investment they received
 plus interest. This payment would reduce the cash available for us to conduct our operations
The market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to
commencement of
 or involvement in
In addition
 if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general
 experiences a loss of investor confidence
 the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business
 financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs
 it could cause the price of our common stock to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that
 even if unsuccessful
If we are unable to pay the costs associated with being a public
 reporting company
We expect to have significant costs associated with being a public
 reporting company
 which may raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on positive cash flow
 if any
 from future operations and on our ability to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. If we are unable to achieve the necessary product sales or raise or obtain needed funding to cover the costs of operating as a public
 reporting company
If we do not continue to meet the eligibility requirements of the OTCQB
 our common stock may be removed from the OTCQB and moved for quotation on the OTC Pink tier of the marketplace maintained by OTC Markets Group
 Inc.
Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB tier of the marketplace maintained by OTC Markets Group
 Inc. The OTCQB requires a minimum bid price of $0.01. If the bid price goes below $0.01
 we may be removed from the OTCQB. If we are removed from the OTCQB
 our stock will be quoted on the OTC Pink tier. Broker-dealers often decline to trade in over-the-counter stocks that are quoted on the OTC Pink tier given the market for such securities are often limited
 the stocks are more volatile
If we move down to the OTC Pink tier from the OTCQB tier
 we may be unable to restore eligibility for quotation of our common stock on the OTCQB tier and this will have a negative impact on our market price. The OTC Pink marketplace also does not provide as much liquidity as the OTCQB. Many broker-dealers will not trade or recommend OTC Pink stocks for their clients. Because the OTCQB generally increases transparency by maintaining higher reporting standards and requirements and imposing management certification and compliance requirements
Our principal shareholder has the ability to exert significant control in matters requiring shareholder approval and could delay
 deter
Richard DeCicco
 our Chief Executive Officer and Director
 owns one (1) share of our Series A Preferred Stock (the only shares of our Series A Preferred Stock that is authorized
 issued and outstanding). This share of Series A Preferred Stock gives Mr. DeCicco two (2) votes for every one (1) vote of our outstanding voting securities. As a result
 he has a majority of the outstanding votes of common shareholders and the ability to influence matters affecting our shareholders
 including the election of our directors
 the acquisition or disposition of our assets
 and the future issuance of our shares. Because he controls this share
 investors may find it difficult to replace our management if they disagree with the way our business is being operated. Because the influence by Mr. DeCicco could result in management making decisions that are in his best interest and not in the best interest of other shareholders
We do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We do not plan on making any cash distributions in the manner of a dividend or otherwise. Our Board presently intends to follow a policy of retaining earnings
We are authorized to issue up to 200

 one (1) share of Series A Preferred Stock

 and 10 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. As of February 7

 (ii) no shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
 (iii) 1

The shares of authorized but undesignated preferred stock may be issued upon filing of an amended certificate of incorporation and the payment of required fees; no further shareholder action is required. If issued
 the rights
 preferences
 designations and limitations of such preferred stock would be set by our Board and could operate to the disadvantage of the outstanding common stock. Such terms could include
 among others
 preferences as to dividends and distributions on liquidation. We have designated five series of preferred stock
Our officers and directors can sell some of their stock
 which may have a negative effect on our stock price and ability to raise additional capital
Our officers and directors
 as a group
 are the owners of 246
594 shares of our common stock
 representing approximately 3.9% of our total issued shares
 with shares of Series D Preferred Stock that they may convert to acquire another 6
756
395 shares of our common stock
 representing approximately 51.9% of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock after conversion. Each individual officer and director may be able to sell up to 1% of our outstanding common stock (currently approximately 62
545 shares) every ninety (90) days in the open market pursuant to Rule 144
 which may have a negative effect on our stock price and may prevent us from obtaining additional capital. In addition
 if our officers and directors are selling their stock into the open market
 it may make it difficult or impossible for investors to sell their stock at any price. However
The Securities Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 requires additional disclosure relating to the market for penny stocks in connection with trades in any stock defined as a penny stock. The Commission has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions. Such exceptions include any equity security listed on NASDAQ and any equity security issued by an issuer that has (i) net tangible assets of at least $2

 if such issuer has been in continuous operation for three years; (ii) net tangible assets of at least $5
000
000
 if such issuer has been in continuous operation for less than three years; or (iii) average annual revenue of at least $6
000

As a smaller reporting company
Our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts
 but also statements that are forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking statements are
 by their very nature
 uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international
 national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain
 manage
 or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; existing government regulations and changes in
 or the failure to comply with
Although the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management
 such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently

 an increase of $470

Professional and consulting fees consist primarily of legal and
 accounting and auditing services. The increase of approximately $471
000 from 2017 to 2018 is related to legal costs of completing our Series E preferred stock financing

548
 compared to other income of $4
074
147 for the year ended December 31
 2017
 a decrease of $6
665
695. The decrease was primarily due to fluctuations of our derivative liabilities from income of $7
429
979 for the year ended December 31
 2017 to income of $1
106
967 for the year ended December 31
 2018. We also reported losses on conversion of debt of ($1
343
910) for the year ended December 31
 2018 compared to ($3
178
010) for the year ended December 31
Our convertible notes contain variable conversion features based on the future trading price of our common stock. Therefore
 the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes are indeterminate. Accordingly
 we recorded the $458
072 fair value of the embedded conversion features at December 31
 2017 as a derivative liability. The fair value of the derivative liability dropped to $0 at December 31
 2018 after we entered into Securities Exchange Agreements with the holders of all convertible debt. For further details
 see Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31
Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and variable interest entity represents 49% of the net loss of Bellissima and BiVi (which we own 51%) and 100% of United Spirits (which we own 0%) and is accounted for as a reduction in the net loss attributable to the Company. This net loss (income) for the year ended December 31
 2018 was $693
364 compared to $(276
505) for the year ended December 31
 2017
 an increase of $969

 or $0.76 per share
 for the year ended December 31
 2017
 a decrease of $8
123
632. Net income (loss) decreased
 as set forth above
 primarily due to the $2

 a decrease of income from derivative liabilities
 and a loss on conversion of debt of ($1

During the year ended December 31
 2018
 because we did not generate sufficient revenue
 we had negative operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of December 31
 2018 was $191
463. Our average monthly cash flow burn rate for 2018 was approximately $146
000 while our average monthly cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was approximately $56
000. We have high cash needs in the short term
 and as our operating expenses increase
 we will face strong to medium long term cash needs. We do not anticipate that our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs for the next year
 and if revenues do not keep up with our expenses
 it will be necessary to seek other methods to finance our operations and any growth opportunities

Our cash and total current assets decreased primarily due to the $4

254 loss from operations in the year ended December 31
 2018. Our total current liabilities decreased slightly primarily due to the payoff of the current portion of debt and its derivative liability
 offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital deficit increased from ($535
226) to ($776

 and our stockholders&#8217; deficit increased by $1

We hope that the revenues we generate from sales of our products will be able to satisfy our obligations in full without the need to raise significant capital from other sources. There is no assurance
 however
Our cash on hand as of December 31

Sources and Uses of Cash for the Year Ended December 31
Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 was $(1

 respectively
 a decrease of $2

259
We had no net cash provided by or used in investing activities for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017. Our future plans include raising additional working capital for the purpose of funding marketing
 inventory purchases
Our net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 was $708
670 and $561
186
 respectively
 an increase of $147
484
 or about 26%. The increase was primarily a result of proceeds received from the sale of Series E Preferred Stock and warrants in 2018 of $831
250
 while we had no such issuance in 2017. This was offset by (i) repayments of $32
284 of loans to officers and affiliates
 (ii) repayment of debt and accrued interest of $90
296
 (iii) receipt of proceeds of $341
837 in 2017 from the issuance of no debt-net while we had no such proceeds in 2018
 and (iv) receipt of proceeds of $300
On October 27
 2017
 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (as amended
&#8221;) with certain investors pursuant to which we sold a total of 480
&#8221;) and 480
&#8221;) for a total of $300
On May 21
 2018
&#8221;) with the investors and Amendment No. 1 to the 2017 Agreement. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement
 the investors exchanged the Common Shares for 1
200
000 Series E Shares. Each Series E Share is convertible into 0.4 shares of our common stock. In addition
 we entered into an amendment to the 2017 Agreement. Under the amended 2017 Agreement
 the investors bought an additional 1
200
000 Series E Shares and an additional 480
000 Warrants for an aggregate of $300
The Warrants are immediately exercisable and have a term of five (5) years. The investors may exercise the Warrants at their option at any time into shares of our common stock. The exercise price for the Warrants issued in October 2017 was $2.50 and the exercise price for the Warrants issued in May 2018 was $12.50. However
 on October 27
 2018 (for the Warrants issued in 2017) and November 1
 2018 (for the Warrants issued in May 2018)
 the exercise price of the Warrants was permanently reduced to the lower of (i) the exercise price
 as adjusted per the terms of the Warrants
 and (ii) 50% of the average of the four lowest closing bid prices for our common stock on the primary trading market during the forty (40) trading days immediately prior to such date. The average of the four lowest closing bid prices of our common stock on the Pink Sheets during the forty (40) trading days prior to October 27
 2018 (same average for November 1
 2018) was $0.6375
 and 50% of which is $0.3188. Therefore
If we sell any of our common stock or equivalent at an effective price per shares less than the exercise price of the Warrants
 then the exercise price of the Warrants will be reduced to the price of the shares sold
 and additional warrant shares will be issuable so that the aggregate exercise price does not change. The Warrants also have the right to pro rata distributions of any dividend
 stock
Cashless exercise of the Warrants is available because after the six-month anniversary of the closing date of the 2017 Agreement
The Warrants and Series E Preferred also require that we reserve and keep available out of our authorized and unissued common stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for issuance of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and conversion of the Series E Preferred
 requiring an initial reserve of 1
920
Pursuant to the terms of the Series E Preferred and Warrants
 we cannot sell or issue shares to an investor if such shares would cause the investor to beneficially own
 as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
 more than 4.99% of our common stock. However
 in the case of both the Warrants and the Series E Preferred
 the investor can raise this limit to 9.99% but not until 61 days after giving us notice. We have not received such a notice. As a result
 as of the date of this report
 an investor cannot own more than approximately 312
100 shares after giving effect to any issuance to the investor. If our total number of outstanding shares of common stock increases
 or if the investor subsequently disposes of shares acquired from us in the open market
Because of this limitation on the investors&#8217; ownership of our stock
The investors also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the 2017 Agreement. If we do not meet our obligations therein
On September 27
 2018
&#8221;) with certain investors to sell 4
650
000 shares of our Series E Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to acquire 1
860
000 shares of common stock for up to an aggregate of $1
162
500. The 2018 Agreement is also subject to a Registration Rights Agreement
 and except as set forth below
Pursuant to the 2018 Agreement
 this purchase and sale will occur in three closings. The first closing occurred on September 27
 2018
 and we received an aggregate of $387
500 in exchange for 1
550
000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock and warrants to acquire 620
000 shares of common stock. The second closing occurred on January 29
 2019
 and we received another $387
500 in exchange for 1
550
000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock and warrants to acquire 620
000 shares of common stock. The third closing
 for the remaining $387

We conducted an evaluation
 with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 or the Exchange Act
 as of December 31
 2018
 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms
 including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive and principal financial officer
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31
 2018
Our principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so
 a control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act
 as amended
 as a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 our principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors
 management and other personnel
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2018. In making this assessment
 our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment
 Management identified the following two material weaknesses that have caused management to conclude that
 as of December 31
 2018
 our disclosure controls and procedures
 and our internal control over financial reporting
2. We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions
 which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature
 segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However
 to the extent possible
 the initiation of transactions
To address these material weaknesses
 management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present
 in all material respects
 our financial position
 results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Accordingly
 we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present
 in all material respects
 our financial condition
To remediate the material weakness in our documentation
No change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report
 fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31
 2018 
 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect

For purposes of determining director independence
 we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). The OTCQB on which shares of common stock are quoted does not have any director independence requirements.

 in the opinion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. According to the NASDAQ definition
Our Board of Directors does not maintain a separate audit
 nominating or compensation committee. Functions customarily performed by such committees are performed by its Board of Directors as a whole. We are not required to maintain such committees under the applicable rules of the OTCQB. We do not currently have an &#8220;audit committee financial expert&#8221; since we currently do not have an audit committee in place. We intend to create board committees

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iconic Brands Inc. (the Company) as of December 31. 2018 and 2017
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 consolidated stockholders' equity. and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended December 3!
 2018
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31
 2018
We conducted &nbsp;our audits in accordance &nbsp;with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards &nbsp;require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain &nbsp;reasonable &nbsp;assurance &nbsp;about &nbsp;whether &nbsp;the financial statements &nbsp;are&nbsp; tree of material &nbsp;misstatement
 &nbsp;whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an &nbsp;audit of &nbsp;its intemal&nbsp; control &nbsp;over financial &nbsp;reporting. As part of our audits
 &nbsp;we are &nbsp;required &nbsp;to obtain &nbsp;an understanding &nbsp;of &nbsp;internal control over &nbsp;financial &nbsp;reporting
 &nbsp;but not for the purpose &nbsp;of expressing &nbsp;an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's &nbsp;internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 &nbsp;whether due &nbsp;to error or fraud
 and performing &nbsp;procedures &nbsp;that respond to those risks. &nbsp;Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
The accompanying &nbsp;financial statements &nbsp;have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the financial statements
 &nbsp;the Company &nbsp;incurred a net loss of $4
157
254 &nbsp;during the year ended December 31
 2018
 and as of that date
 had a deficit net worth of $3
037
366. &nbsp;The company &nbsp;is in arears with certain vendor creditors &nbsp;which
 among other things
 cause the balances to become due on demand. The Company is not aware of any alternate sources of capital to meet such demands

Generally accepted accounting principles require disclosing the fair value of financial instruments to the extent practicable for financial instruments which are recognized or unrecognized in the balance sheet. The fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not necessarily representative of the amount that could be realized or settled
Iconic Brands
Years ended December 31
In assessing the fair value of financial instruments
 the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions
 which are based on estimates of market conditions and risks existing at the time. For certain instruments
 including cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses
(e) Accounts Receivable
The Company extends unsecured credit to customers in the ordinary course of business but mitigates risk by performing credit checks and by actively pursuing past due accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on customer historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable. At December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out method) or market
 with due consideration given to obsolescence and to slow moving items. Inventory at December 31
In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which establishes revenue recognition standards. ASU 2014-19 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
In 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-2 (Topic 842) which establishes a new lease accounting model for lessees. Under the new guidance
 lessees will be required to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for most leases having terms of 12 months or more. ASU 2016-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
Revenue from product sales is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (2) the price is fixed or determinable
 (3) collectability is reasonably assured
 and (4) delivery has occurred. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement and fixed price criteria are satisfied through purchase orders. Collectability criteria are satisfied through credit approvals. Delivery criteria are satisfied when the products are shipped to a customer and title and risk of loss passes to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale. The Company has no obligation to accept the return of products sold other than for replacement of damaged products. Other than quantity price discounts negotiated with customers prior to billing and delivery (which are reflected as a reduction in sales)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

On July 13
 2017
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2017-11. Among other things
 ASU 2017-11 provides guidance that eliminates the requirement to consider &#8220;down round&#8221; features when determining whether certain financial instruments or embedded features are indexed to an entity&#8217;s stock and need to be classified as liabilities. ASU 2017-11 provides for entities to recognize the effect of a down round feature only when it is triggered and then as a dividend and a reduction to income available to common stockholders in basic earnings per share. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018; early adoption is permitted. Accordingly
 effective January 1

 the Company will reflect a $720

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained significant net losses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit at December 31
 2018 of $21
233
083 and has experienced periodic cash flow difficulties
Continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional working capital. The management of the Company has developed a strategy which it believes will accomplish this objective through short term loans from related parties and additional equity investments which will enable the Company to continue operations for the coming year. However
 there is no assurance that these objectives will be met. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts

In September 2018
 the Company entered into Securities Exchange Agreements and other agreements with holders of all convertible debt then outstanding to have such debt satisfied (which occurred effective October 4
 2018 &#8211; see Note 7). Accordingly
 the Company reduced the then derivative liability from $255
294 at September 30
Before being satisfied
 the above convertible notes contained variable conversion features based on the future trading price of the Company common stock. Therefore
 the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes was indeterminate. Accordingly
 we recorded the $458
072 fair value of the embedded conversion features at December 31
 2017 as a derivative liability. The $458
072 decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability from $458
072 at December 31
 2017 to $0 at December 31
The fair values of the embedded conversion features are measured quarterly using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used to calculate the derivative liability at December 31
 2017 include stock price of $1.625 per share
 (2) exercise prices ranging from $0.375 to $2.50 per share
 (3) terms ranging from 3 months to 9 months
 (4) expected volatility of 159%
From September 2017 to November 2017
 in connection with the sale of a total of 480
000 shares of common stock (see Note 10)
 the Company issued a total of 480
000 Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the &#8220;Warrants&#8221;) to the respective investors. The Warrants are exercisable into ICNB common stock at a price of $2.50 per share
 expire five years from date of issuance
Effective May 21
 2018
 in connection with the sale of a total of 120
000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock (see Note 10)
 the Company issued a total of 480
000 Warrants to four investors. These warrants are exercisable into ICNB common stock at a price of $2.50 per share
 expire five years from date of issuance
The down round provision of the above Warrants requires a reduction in the exercise price if there are future issuances of common stock equivalents at a lower price than the $2.50 exercise price of the Warrants. Accordingly
 we have recorded the $1
182
750 fair value of the Warrants at December 31
 2018 as a derivative liability. The $486
750 increase in the fair value of the derivative liability from $696
000 at December 31
 2017 to $1
182
750 at December 31
The fair value of the Warrants is measured quarterly using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the Warrants at December 31
 2018 include (1) stock price of $1.125 per share
 (2) exercise prices from $0.635 to $2.50 per share
 (3) terms ranging from 2.25 years to 4.5 years
 (4) expected volatility of 148%
Assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the Warrants at December 31
 2017 include (1) stock price of $1.625 per share
 (2) exercise price of $2.50 per share
 (3) term of 5 years
 (4) expected volatility of 159%

 the Company has maintained a 100% valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset in the financial statements at December 31

 all references to the term Initial Registration Statement shall mean the term as defined in the Existing Registration Rights Agreement)
 including without limitation by amendment thereto
 the maximum number of Registrable Securities issued by the Company in the First Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) that can be included in such Initial Registration Statement in accordance with the SEC Guidance
 which Registrable Securities shall be included in the Initial Registration Statement as follows: firstly
 the maximum number of Registrable Securities under clause (a) of the definition of Registrable Securities and
 secondly
 maximum number of Registrable Securities under the remaining clauses of the definition of Registrable Securities (such Registrable Securities which are included in Initial Registration Statement
&#8221;)
 provided that
 in the case that some Registrable Securities may be included in the Initial Registration Statement
 such Registrable Securities shall be allocated to the Holders on a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by such Holders. The Company shall use diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for the inclusion of the maximum number of Registrable Securities in the Initial Registration Statement and the failure by the Company to include the maximum number of Registrable Securities in such Initial Registration Statement shall be an Event hereunder. For purposes of clarity
&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the Company&#8217;s registration obligations hereunder
(a) Not less than five (5) Trading Days prior to the filing of each Registration Statement and not less than one (1) Trading Day prior to the filing of any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (including any document that would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference)
 the Company shall (i) furnish to each Holder copies of all such documents proposed to be filed
 which documents (other than those incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference) will be subject to the review of such Holders
 and (ii) cause its officers and directors
 counsel and independent registered public accountants to respond to such inquiries as shall be necessary
 in the reasonable opinion of respective counsel to each Holder

(b) (i) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments
 including post-effective amendments
 to a Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep a Registration Statement continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable Securities for the Effectiveness Period and prepare and file with the Commission such additional Registration Statements in order to register for resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities
 (ii) cause the related Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement (subject to the terms of this Agreement)
 and
 as so supplemented or amended
 to be filed pursuant to Rule 424
 (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably possible to any comments received from the Commission with respect to a Registration Statement or any amendment thereto and provide as promptly as reasonably possible to the Holders true and complete copies of all correspondence from and to the Commission relating to a Registration Statement (provided that
 the Company shall excise any information contained therein which would constitute material non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
(c) If during the Effectiveness Period
 the number of Registrable Securities at any time exceeds 100% of the number of shares of Common Stock then registered in a Registration Statement
 then the Company shall file as soon as reasonably practicable
 but in any case prior to the applicable Filing Date
(d) Notify the Holders of Registrable Securities to be sold (which notice shall
 pursuant to clauses (iii) through (vi) hereof
 be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes have been made) as promptly as reasonably possible (and
 in the case of (i)(A) below
 not less than one (1) Trading Day prior to such filing) and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such notice in writing no later than one (1) Trading Day following the day (i)(A) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement is proposed to be filed
 (B) when the Commission notifies the Company whether there will be a &#8220;review&#8221; of such Registration Statement and whenever the Commission comments in writing on such Registration Statement
 and (C) with respect to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
 when the same has become effective
 (ii) of any request by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information
 (iii) of the issuance by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or the initiation of any Proceedings for that purpose
 (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction
 or the initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such purpose
 (v) of the occurrence of any event or passage of time that makes the financial statements included in a Registration Statement ineligible for inclusion therein or any statement made in a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires any revisions to a Registration Statement
 Prospectus or other documents so that
 in the case of a Registration Statement or the Prospectus
 as the case may be
 it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
 in light of the circumstances under which they were made
 not misleading
 and (vi) of the occurrence or existence of any pending corporate development with respect to the Company that the Company believes may be material and that
 in the determination of the Company
 makes it not in the best interest of the Company to allow continued availability of a Registration Statement or Prospectus; 
 
 that in no event shall any such notice contain any information which would constitute material
(e) Use its best efforts to avoid the issuance of
 or
 if issued
 obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order stopping or suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement
 or (ii) any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction
(f) Furnish to each Holder
 without charge
 at least one conformed copy of each such Registration Statement and each amendment thereto
 including financial statements and schedules
 all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference to the extent requested by such Person
 and all exhibits to the extent requested by such Person (including those previously furnished or incorporated by reference) promptly after the filing of such documents with the Commission; provided
(g) Subject to the terms of this Agreement
 the Company hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto
(h) Prior to any resale of Registrable Securities by a Holder
 use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the selling Holders in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from the Registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for the resale by the Holder under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as any Holder reasonably requests in writing
 to keep each registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the Effectiveness Period and to do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by each Registration Statement; provided
 that
 the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified
(i) If requested by a Holder
 cooperate with such Holder to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to a Registration Statement
 which certificates shall be free
 to the extent permitted by the Purchase Agreement
 of all restrictive legends
(j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(d)
 as promptly as reasonably possible under the circumstances taking into account the Company&#8217;s good faith assessment of any adverse consequences to the Company and its stockholders of the premature disclosure of such event
 prepare a supplement or amendment
 including a post-effective amendment
 to a Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference
 and file any other required document so that
 as thereafter delivered
 neither a Registration Statement nor such Prospectus will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
 in light of the circumstances under which they were made
 not misleading. If the Company notifies the Holders in accordance with clauses (iii) through (vi) of Section 3(d) above to suspend the use of any Prospectus until the requisite changes to such Prospectus have been made
 then the Holders shall suspend use of such Prospectus. The Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed as promptly as is practicable. The Company shall be entitled to exercise its right under this Section 3(j) to suspend the availability of a Registration Statement and Prospectus
 subject to the payment of partial liquidated damages otherwise required pursuant to Section 2(d)
(k) Otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
 including
 without limitation
 Rule 172 under the Securities Act
 file any final Prospectus
 including any supplement or amendment thereof
 with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act
 promptly inform the Holders in writing if
 at any time during the Effectiveness Period
 the Company does not satisfy the conditions specified in Rule 172 and
 as a result thereof
(m) The Company may require each selling Holder to furnish to the Company a certified statement as to the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and
 if required by the Commission
 the natural persons thereof that have voting and dispositive control over the shares. During any periods that the Company is unable to meet its obligations hereunder with respect to the registration of the Registrable Securities solely because any Holder fails to furnish such information within three Trading Days of the Company&#8217;s request
 any liquidated damages that are accruing at such time as to such Holder only shall be tolled and any Event that may otherwise occur solely because of such delay shall be suspended as to such Holder only
 until such information is delivered to the Company and an amendment to the Registration Statement is filed to incorporate Holder&#8217;s information
. All fees and expenses incident to the performance of or compliance with
 this Agreement by the Company shall be borne by the Company whether or not any Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to a Registration Statement. The fees and expenses referred to in the foregoing sentence shall include
 without limitation

 notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement
 indemnify and hold harmless each Holder
 the officers
 directors
 members

 notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of each such controlling Person
 to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
 from and against any and all losses
 claims
 damages
 liabilities
 costs (including
 without limitation
 reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees) and expenses (collectively
&#8221;)
 as incurred
 arising out of or relating to (1) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement
 any Prospectus or any form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus
 or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or supplement thereto
 in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading or (2) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act
 the Exchange Act or any state securities law
 or any rule or regulation thereunder
 in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement
 except to the extent
 but only to the extent
 that (i) such untrue statements or omissions are based solely upon information regarding such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein
 or to the extent that such information relates to such Holder or such Holder&#8217;s proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such Holder expressly for use in a Registration Statement
 such Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (it being understood that the Holder has approved Annex A hereto for this purpose) or (ii) in the case of an occurrence of an event of the type specified in Section 3(d)(iii)-(vi)
 the use by such Holder of an outdated
 defective or otherwise unavailable Prospectus after the Company has notified such Holder in writing that the Prospectus is outdated
 defective or otherwise unavailable for use by such Holder and prior to the receipt by such Holder of the Advice contemplated in Section 6(d). The Company shall notify the Holders promptly of the institution
. Each Holder shall
 severally and not jointly
 indemnify and hold harmless the Company
 its directors
 officers
 agents and employees
 each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act)
 and the directors

 in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading (i) to the extent
 but only to the extent
 that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such Holder to the Company expressly for inclusion in such Registration Statement or such Prospectus or (ii) to the extent
 but only to the extent
 that such information relates to such Holder&#8217;s information provided in the Selling Stockholder Questionnaire or the proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such Holder expressly for use in a Registration Statement (it being understood that the Holder has approved Annex A hereto for this purpose)
&#8221;)
&#8221;) in writing
 and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
 including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided
 that
 the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement
An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof
 but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses
 (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding
 or (3) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
 and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall reasonably believe that a material conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case
 if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party
 the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one separate counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent
 which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Indemnifying Party shall
 without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
 effect any settlement of any pending Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party
Subject to the terms of this Agreement
 all reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this Section) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party
 as incurred
 within ten Trading Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party; provided
 that
. If the indemnification under Section 5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless for any Losses
 then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party
 in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions
 statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to
 among other things
 whether any action in question
 including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact
 has been taken or made by
 or relates to information supplied by
 such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party
 and the parties&#8217; relative intent
 knowledge
 access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action
 statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include
 subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement
. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement
 each Holder or the Company
 as the case may be
 in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement
 including recovery of damages
 shall be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. Each of the Company and each Holder agrees that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that
 in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach
. Neither the Company nor any of its security holders (other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the Company in any Registration Statements other than the Registrable Securities. The Company shall not file any other registration statements until all Registrable Securities are registered pursuant to a Registration Statement that is declared effective by the Commission
. By its acquisition of Registrable Securities
 each Holder agrees that
 upon receipt of a notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section 3(d)(iii) through (vi)
. If
 at any time during the Effectiveness Period
 there is not an effective Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities
 other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection with the Company&#8217;s stock option or other employee benefit plans
 then the Company shall deliver to each Holder a written notice of such determination and
 if within fifteen days after the date of the delivery of such notice
 any such Holder shall so request in writing
 the Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such Holder requests to be registered; 
 
 that
 following the date on which no Warrants remain outstanding
. The provisions of this Agreement
 including the provisions of this sentence
 may not be amended
 modified or supplemented
 and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given
 unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company and the Holders of 50.1% or more of the then outstanding Registrable Securities (for purposes of clarification
 this includes any Registrable Securities issuable upon exercise or conversion of any Security)
 provided that
 if any amendment
 modification or waiver disproportionately and adversely impacts a Holder (or group of Holders)
 the consent of such disproportionately impacted Holder (or group of Holders) shall be required. If a Registration Statement does not register all of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a waiver or amendment done in compliance with the previous sentence
 then the number of Registrable Securities to be registered for each Holder shall be reduced pro rata among all Holders and each Holder shall have the right to designate which of its Registrable Securities shall be omitted from such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of a Holder or some Holders and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given only by such Holder or Holders of all of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent relates; 
 
 that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended
 modified
. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered
 as of the date hereof
 nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
 on or after the date of this Agreement
 enter into any agreement with respect to its securities
 that would have the effect of impairing the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. Except as set forth on 
. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
 all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party
 it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a &#8220;.pdf&#8221; format data file
. All questions concerning the construction
 validity
. If any term
 provision
 covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid
 illegal
 void or unenforceable
 the remainder of the terms
 provisions
 covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected
 impaired or invalidated
 and the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term
 provision
 covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining terms
 provisions
 covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid
 illegal
. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience only
. The obligations of each Holder hereunder are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Holder hereunder
 and no Holder shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Holder hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other agreement or document delivered at any closing
 and no action taken by any Holder pursuant hereto or thereto
 shall be deemed to constitute the Holders as a partnership
 an association
 a joint venture or any other kind of group or entity
 or create a presumption that the Holders are in any way acting in concert or as a group or entity with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other matters
 and the Company acknowledges that the Holders are not acting in concert or as a group
 and the Company shall not assert any such claim
 with respect to such obligations or transactions. Each Holder shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights
 including without limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement
 and it shall not be necessary for any other Holder to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. The use of a single agreement with respect to the obligations of the Company contained was solely in the control of the Company
 not the action or decision of any Holder
 and was done solely for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by any Holder. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement is between the Company and a Holder
 solely
