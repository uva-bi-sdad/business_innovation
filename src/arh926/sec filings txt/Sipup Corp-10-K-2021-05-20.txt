Item
1. Business.

Our
Company

On
June 2
 2019
 the Company completed the acquisition of Enlightened Capital Ltd.
 an Israeli company with offices at Bnei-Brak
 Israel
(&ldquo;Enlightened&rdquo;) whereby Enlightened became a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As consideration
 the Company
issued to Enlightened&rsquo;s shareholders 18
000
000 common Stock
 par value $0.001 per share.

Enlightened
is engaged
 in the field of green energy and is licensed to internationally trade in Certified Emission Reductions
 also known as carbon
credits (&ldquo;CERs&rdquo;)
 as issued by the UN until 2040 The Company
 collectively with Enlightened are hereunder referred to as
the &ldquo;Group&rdquo;.

&nbsp;The
transaction was accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;). Under this method of accounting
 Enlightened was deemed to be the accounting acquirer for financial
reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on the facts that
 immediately following the Merger: (i) Enlightened&rsquo;s
stockholders owned a substantial majority of the voting rights in the combined company. As a result of the Recapitalization Transaction
the shareholders of Enlightened received the largest ownership interest in the Company
 and Enlightened was determined to be the &ldquo;accounting
acquirer&rdquo; in the Recapitalization Transaction. As a result
 the historical financial statements of the Company were replaced with
the historical financial statements of Enlightened. The number of shares prior to the reverse capitalization have been retroactively
adjusted based on the equivalent number of shares received by the accounting acquirer in the Recapitalization Transaction.

On
April 25
 2021
 the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement with VeganNation Services Ltd.
 a company formed under the laws of
the State of Israel (&ldquo;VeganNation&rdquo;) and the shareholders of VeganNation pursuant to which VeganNation would become a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company
 and the shareholders of VeganNation would receive an aggregate of 23
562
240 shares of common stock
of the Company. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.

VeganNation
is
 a leading global plant-based company building an all-encompassing conscious consumer ecosystem
 connecting and empowering plant-based
and sustainable businesses and individuals. Management of the Company believes that the growth of sustainable and plant-based consumer
goods presents a unique opportunity to participate in the fastest growing lifestyle globally.

In
connection with the proposed transaction
 the VeganNation stockholders are expected to receive comon stock of Sipup that will be equal
to approximately 50% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company at the closing of the proposed merger
 on a fully diluted
basis. Following(and subject to) the closing of the proposed merger
 VeganNation will effect a change in the Company&rsquo;s Board of
Directors and management.

Additionally
VeganNation has
 on November 26
 2020
 entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (the &ldquo;LOI&rdquo;) to acquire a vegan industry
company located in the United States (the &ldquo;Target&rdquo;) for a $4 million acquisition. VeganNation has assigned the LOI to the
Company. As the Company has previously disclosed in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 26
 2021
 the Company
and Target have terminated all discussions relating to the acquisition of the Target

During
December 2020 the company
 in consideration of the advance of $50
000 for purposes of paying outstanding Company obligation to third
parties
 the Company issued to Adi Zim and Rosario Capital Ltd. its unsecured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of
$50
000 (the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;). The Note is repayable upon the earlier of December 15
 2021 or the closing of the Stock Exchange Agreement
with VeganNation. The Note is convertible into shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock at a rate equal to $0.10 per share
. As of
November 30
 2020
 the proceeds of the Note were not remitted to the Company.

Corporate
History &amp; Recent Events

On
October 31
 2012
 the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Through fiscal year 2013
 we were engaged in the
production
 packing and selling of flavored yogurts and have not generated any revenue; our independent auditors have issued an opinion
about our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our audited financial statements for the year ended November 30
2020. Our accumulated deficit is $337
262 as of November 30
 2020. We currently have no revenue generating business and are focusing
on finalizing the transactions discussed above.

During
March 2019 the Company issued Adi Zim Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Adi&rdquo;) 644
000 restricted shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
in consideration for remittance of $100
000 for purposes of paying outstanding Company obligation to third parties&nbsp;

During
April 2019
 the Company and Rosario Capital Ltd. (&ldquo;Rosario&rdquo;) have entered into additional service agreement
 pursuant to
which Rosario is providing to the Company certain financial advisory and other services. In consideration of any and all Rosario&rsquo;s
Services
 the Company has issued to Rosario 900
000 restricted shares of common stock. The service agreement will be terminated on December
31
 2020. The fair value of the restricted shares as of the date of issuance was $144
000 using the share price on the day of issuance.


    
    




We
do not maintain any insurance. Because we do not have any insurance
 if we are made a party of a legal action
 we may not have sufficient
funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.



As
of May 20
 2021
 we have two employees
 all of whom are officers. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.



The
Company&rsquo;s principal offices are located at 3 Kiryat Hamada
 3rd floor
 Jerusalem
 Israel. Our telephone number is 1-305-999-5232.

Government
Regulation

We
will be required to comply with all regulations
 rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which
we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required governments approvals present that we need approval from or
any existing government regulation on our business.

We
currently have not obtained any copyrights
 patents or trademarks. We do not anticipate filing any copyright or trademark applications
related to any assets over the next 12 months.

Going
Concern

Our
cash balance is $Nil as of November 30
 2020. We do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations
beyond one year&rsquo;s time.

Our
independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue
as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not
generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will
ever reach that stage.

We
anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations
 if any
 will be insufficient to satisfy our
liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company will seek
to obtain these funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements
 debt or other sources of financing. If we are
unable to obtain sufficient additional financing
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations
 which could harm
our business
 financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not be available on favorable
terms
 if at all.

At
the present time
 we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock
 it will likely not be sufficient to support
our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations
 we will either suspend product development
and marketing activities until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations entirely

Subject
to raising working capital
 for which we have no commitments
 management may also consider other business opportunities
 including a
strategic merger or acquisition outside our current line of business
 in order to increase shareholder value.


    
    


Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources.

Limited
operating history; Need for additional capital

There
is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations
and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to
risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise
 including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due
to price and cost increases in services and products.

We
have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms
we may be unable to continue
 develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.

Item
1A. Risk Factors.

The
Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required
under this item.

Item
1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

Not
applicable.

Item
2. Properties.

The
Company does not own any property. We currently lease a virtual office at 30 Wall St. 8th floor
 Manhattan
 NY on a month to month basis.
We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our present needs.

Item
3. Legal Proceedings.

The
Company is not party to any legal proceedings
 nor is there any known legal proceedings contemplated against the Company.

No
director
 officer or affiliate of the Company and no owner of record or beneficial owner of more than 5.0% of the securities of the Company
or any associate of any such director
 officer or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse
to the Company in reference to pending litigation.

Item
4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

Not
applicable.

have not declared or paid dividends on our common stock since our formation
 and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable
future. Declaration or payment of dividends
 if any
 in the future
 will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend
on our then current financial condition
 results of operations
 capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of
Directors. There are no contractual restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends.

SECURITIES
AUTHORIZED UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

We
have no equity compensation or stock option plans. We may in the future adopt a stock option.


    
    


Item
7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Results
of Operations

From
November 30
 2019 to November 30
 2020

For
the year ended November 30
 2020
 we had no revenue and had general and administrative expenses of $61
248 comprised of Professional
fees and filings fees as compared to general and administrative expenses of $48
800 for the year ended November 30
 2019. In addition
we recorded interest expenses on loan of $11
367 resulting in a net loss of $72
615 as compared to interest expenses on loan of $6
090
for the year ended November 30
 2019.&nbsp;

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of November 30
 2020
 the company had $Nil cash and our liabilities were $261
082
 consisting primarily of Accounts payable and accrued
expenses of $88
200 and Loans from stockholders of $172
882. As of November 30
 2019
 the company had $Nil cash and our liabilities were
$274
867
 consisting primarily of Accounts payable and accrued expenses of $113
352 and Loans from stockholders of $161
515.

Our
auditors have issued a &ldquo;going concern&rdquo; opinion
 meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going
business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until after receiving
sufficient financing and implementing our plan of operations. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The
Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $25
000.

Existing
working capital
 further advances and debt instruments
 and anticipated cash flow are expected to be inadequate to fund our operations
over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally
 we have financed operations
to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan
 management
anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental
expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. Although we intend to finance these expenses with further
issuances of securities
 and debt issuances
 no assurance can be provided that we will be able to raise funds on commercially acceptable
terms or at all.

We
anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations
 if any
 will be insufficient to satisfy our
liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company will seek
to obtain those funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements
 debt or other sources of financing. If we are
unable to obtain sufficient additional financing
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations
 which could harm
our business
 financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not be available on favorable
terms
 if at all.

At
the present time
 we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock; however it will likely not be sufficient to
support our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the capital needed to support our operations
 we will either suspend product
development and marketing activities until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations entirely. Because we have been unable to raise additional
cash
 Management may consider other business opportunities in order to maintain and increase shareholder value.

We
are highly dependent upon the success of the private offerings of equity or debt securities
 as described herein. Therefore
 the failure
thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans
 which would likely not even be possible for
the Company. At such time these funds are required
 management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot
raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities
 or secure a loan
 the Company would be required to
cease business operations. As a result
 investors would lose all of their investment.

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item.

Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The
information called for by Item 8 is included following the &ldquo;Index to Financial Statements&rdquo; on page F-1 contained in this
annual report on Form 10-K.

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

On
May 20
 2020 (the &ldquo;Dismissal Date&rdquo;)
 the Board of Directors the Company dismissed Weinstein &amp; Co C.P.A. (&ldquo;Weinstein&rdquo;)
as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. On May 20
 2020
 the Board engaged Halperin CPA
 Financial Consulting

&rdquo;)
denying W&amp;CO the privilege of appearing or practicing before the SEC.

The
reports of Weinstein on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements for the two most recent fiscal years did not contain an adverse or disclaimer
of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty
 audit scope
 or accounting principles

than an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern

During
the two most recent fiscal years and through the Dismissal Date
 there were (i) no disagreements between the Company and Weinstein on
any matter of accounting principles or practices
 financial statement disclosure
 or auditing scope or procedures
 which disagreement
if not resolved to the satisfaction of Weinstein
 would have caused Weinstein to make reference thereto in their reports on the consolidated
financial statements for such years
 and (ii) no &ldquo;reportable events&rdquo; as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation
S-K.

During
the Company&rsquo;s two most recent fiscal years and in the subsequent interim period through the Dismissal Date
 neither the

application of accounting principles to a specified transaction
 either completed or proposed
 or the type of audit opinion that
might be rendered on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements
 and neither a written report nor oral advice was
provided to the Company by Halperin that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the
accounting
 auditing
 or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of either a disagreement as defined in
Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.



    
    


Item
9A. Controls and Procedures.

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed
by
 or under the supervision of
 the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company&rsquo;s
board of directors
 management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:


Pertains
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets;



Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors; and



Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of company assets that
could have a material effect on our financial statements.


Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and our financial officer
 an
evaluation was performed on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation
 our and principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report for the purpose
of gathering
 analyzing and disclosing of information that the Company is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms for the reasons set forth in our annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30
 2020. 

(b)
Changes in Internal Controls. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during quarter ended November 30
 2020 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.


    
    


Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As
of November 30
 2020
 management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting based on
the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
Based on that evaluation
 they concluded that
 during the period covered by this report
 such internal control over financial reporting
were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies
that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls
and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.

A
material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with
the assessment described above
 management identified the following internal control over financial reporting deficiencies that represent
material weaknesses as of November 30
 2020.



    
    
Financial
    Reporting and Closing Process: We did not maintain an effective financial reporting and closing process to prepare financial statements
    in accordance with GAAP. We determined that controls over timely and complete financial statement reviews
 effective journal entry
    controls
 and appropriate reconciliation processes were missing or&nbsp;ineffective. Further
 we were unable to complete regulatory
    filings timely as required by the rules of the SEC.




    
    
Qualified
    Personnel: We lacked a sufficient number of qualified accounting personnel in key financial reporting positions to operate processes
    and controls over the year end close process. As a result
 a reasonable possibility exists that material misstatements in our financial
    statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.




    
    
Control
    Monitoring: Our controls for monitoring the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting across the Company were&nbsp;ineffective. As a result
 a reasonable possibility exists that material misstatements in our
    financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


Management
believes that the material weaknesses above did not have an effect on our financial results

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls
 we have initiated
or plan to initiate the following series of measures.

Subject
to raising capital
 of which no assurance can be provided
 we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives
and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available
to us. And we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee who
will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving
estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors
 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
 will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements
 as
necessary and as funds allow.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by the Company&rsquo;s independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide management
report in the Annual Report.

Baruch
Yadid
 Age 63

the last 10 years Mr. Yadid was involved&nbsp;in several real estates and commercial deals in Israel and abroad
 he also played a major
role in the successes of private companies

Director
Independence

None
of our directors presently qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global
Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests
 such as that the director is not
 and has not been for
at least three years
 one of our employees and that neither the director
 nor any of his family members has engaged in various types
of business dealings with us. In addition
 our board of director has not made a subjective determination as to its sole director that
no relationships exist which
 in the opinion of our board of director
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying
out the responsibilities of a director
 though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. &nbsp;Had our board of
director made these determinations
 our board of director would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the director and
us with regard to each director business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.


    
    


Conflicts
of Interest

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed by
such committees are performed by our current directors. The Board of Director has not established an audit committee and does not have
an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees
are not necessary since the Company is an early development stage company
 and to date
 such directors have been performing the functions
of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors have the authority to determine issues concerning
management compensation
 nominations
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions.

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings

There
are no legal proceedings that have occurred in the past 10 years concerning our sole officer and director which involved a criminal conviction
a criminal proceeding
 an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one&rsquo;s participation in the securities or banking industries
or a finding of securities or commodities law violations.&nbsp;

FAMILY
RELATIONS

There
are no family relationships among the directors and officers of Sipup Corporation.

AUDIT
COMMITTEE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed by
such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit
committee financial expert
 nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such
committees are not necessary since the Company is an early exploration stage company and has only four directors
 and to date
 such directors
have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers
have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions.

There
are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above
 we are not aware of any other conflicts of
interest with any of our executive officers or directors.

CODE
OF ETHICS

The
Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officers
 principal financial officer
 principal accounting
officer or controller
 or persons performing similar functions. The Company has not adopted a code of ethics because it currently has
minimal operations.

SECTION
16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who own more than ten percent
of a registered class of our equity securities
 file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers
directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based on our review of filings made on the SEC website
 and the fact of us not receiving certain forms or written representations from
certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements
 we believe that
 during the year ended November
30
 2020
 our executive officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.&nbsp;

and comprehensive loss
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended November 30
2020
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements
present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of November 30

 in conformity with accounting principles

prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements
 the Company has
not yet generated material revenues from its operations to fund its activities and is therefore dependent upon external sources for financing
its operations. As of November 30
 2020
 the Company has incurred accumulated deficit of $286
910 and negative operating cash flows. These
factor among others
 as discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue
as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of&rsquo; these uncertainties.



of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.


standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged
to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
 we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.


the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE 1 &ndash; NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS
OF PRESENTATION


is a Nevada Corporation incorporated on October 31
 2012. For additional information see subsequent events




 2019
 the Company
completed the acquisition of Enlightened Capital Ltd.
 an Israeli company with offices at Bnei-Brak
 Israel (&ldquo;Enlightened&rdquo;)
whereby Enlightened became a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As consideration
 the Company issued to Enlightened&rsquo;s
shareholders 18

000 common Stock
 par value $0.001 per share.


 in
the field of green energy and is licensed to internationally trade in Certified Emission Reductions
 also known as carbon credits (&ldquo;CERs&rdquo;)
as issued by the UN until 2040.


for as a reverse asset acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).
Under this method of accounting
 Enlightened was deemed to be the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. This determination
was primarily based on the facts that
 immediately following the Merger: (i) Enlightened&rsquo;s stockholders owned a substantial majority
of the voting rights in the combined company. As a result of the Recapitalization Transaction
 the shareholders of Enlightened received
the largest ownership interest in the Company
 and Enlightened was determined to be the &ldquo;accounting acquirer&rdquo; in the Recapitalization
Transaction. As a result
 the historical financial statements of the Company were replaced with the historical financial statements of
Enlightened. The number of shares prior to the reverse capitalization have been retroactively adjusted based on the equivalent number
of shares received by the accounting acquirer in the Recapitalization Transaction.




statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets
and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of November 30
 2020
 the Company has an accumulated deficit of
$286
910 from operations and has earned no revenues to cover its operating costs. The Company intends to fund future operations through
equity financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working capital and other cash requirements
for the year ending November 30
 2020.


to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing to continue operations
 and
development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional funds through public or private
placement offerings.

include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

GAAP&rdquo;). These financial statements are presented in US dollars.



    
    


Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated
financial statements


statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts
of expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As applicable to these financial statements
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the going concern assumptions.

Cash and cash equivalents
 and Restricted cash


highly liquid investments which include short term bank deposits (up to three months from date of deposit)
 that are not restricted as
to withdrawals or use that are readily convertible to cash with maturities of three months or less as of the date acquired. The Company
maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&ldquo;FDIC&rdquo;)
up to $250
000.&nbsp;




per share in accordance with ASC 260
 &ldquo;Earnings Per Share&rdquo; ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings
per share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable
to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined
by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise options granted to employees. As November 30
 2020
 the Company had no
potentially dilutive shares.




for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes.&rdquo; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets
are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.




instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires all share-based compensation
payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value using an option pricing model. ASC 718 requires forfeitures
to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.

disincentive for non-performance.




    
    





and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements
 which
represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
 as the case may be
 in an orderly
transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value
on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation techniques
 are assigned a hierarchical level.

 the Company
completed the acquisition of Enlightened Capital Ltd.
 an Israeli company with offices at Bnei-Brak

for as a reverse asset acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&amp;#x201c;GAAP&amp;#x201d;).
Under this method of accounting
 Enlightened was deemed to be the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. This determination
was primarily based on the facts that
 immediately following the Merger: (i) Enlightened&amp;#x2019;s stockholders owned a substantial majority
of the voting rights in the combined company. As a result of the Recapitalization Transaction
 the shareholders of Enlightened received
the largest ownership interest in the Company
 and Enlightened was determined to be the &amp;#x201c;accounting acquirer&amp;#x201d; in the Recapitalization
Transaction. As a result
 the historical financial statements of the Company were replaced with the historical financial statements of
Enlightened. The number of shares prior to the reverse capitalization have been retroactively adjusted based on the equivalent number
of shares received by the accounting acquirer in the Recapitalization Transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font: 10pt Times New Roman

 the Company has an accumulated deficit of
$286

equity financing arrangements

NOTE 1 &#x2013; NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS
Sipup Corporation (the &#x201c;Company&#x201d;)
is a Nevada Corporation incorporated on October 31
On June 2
 2019
 the Company
completed the acquisition of Enlightened Capital Ltd.
 an Israeli company with offices at Bnei-Brak
 Israel (&#x201c;Enlightened&#x201d;)
whereby Enlightened became a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As consideration
 the Company issued to Enlightened&#x2019;s
shareholders 18
000
000 common Stock
Enlightened is engaged
 in
the field of green energy and is licensed to internationally trade in Certified Emission Reductions
 also known as carbon credits (&#x201c;CERs&#x201d;)
The transaction was accounted
for as a reverse asset acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#x201c;GAAP&#x201d;).
Under this method of accounting
 Enlightened was deemed to be the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. This determination
was primarily based on the facts that
 immediately following the Merger: (i) Enlightened&#x2019;s stockholders owned a substantial majority
of the voting rights in the combined company. As a result of the Recapitalization Transaction
 the shareholders of Enlightened received
the largest ownership interest in the Company
 and Enlightened was determined to be the &#x201c;accounting acquirer&#x201d; in the Recapitalization
Transaction. As a result
 the historical financial statements of the Company were replaced with the historical financial statements of
Enlightened. The number of shares prior to the reverse capitalization have been retroactively adjusted based on the equivalent number
The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets
and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of November 30
 2020
 the Company has an accumulated deficit of
$286
910 from operations and has earned no revenues to cover its operating costs. The Company intends to fund future operations through
equity financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working capital and other cash requirements
for the year ending November 30
The ability of the Company
to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing to continue operations
 and
development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional funds through public or private
These factors
 among others
raise substantial doubt about the Company&#x2019;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 &#x201c;Earnings Per Share&#x201d; ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings
per share (&#x201c;EPS&#x201d;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable
to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined
