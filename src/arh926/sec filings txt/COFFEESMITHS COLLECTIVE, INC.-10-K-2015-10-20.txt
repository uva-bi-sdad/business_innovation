FWF Holdings Inc. is a Hot Sauce product business that will focus on selling its hot sauce product with a blend of peppers
 fruits
 herbs and spices under the brand name &#8220;Fruit With Fire&#8221;. The Company has targeted four main customer groups to sell its product. The first group is specialty food stores
 the second is wholesale distributors
 the third is restaurants and the last customer segment is through a company owned online website. We recently signed an agreement with a third party manufacturer and have placed our initial order of product. We intend to identify and distinguish ourselves by positioning our product at the high end of the market in price
The Company has begun to implement its business model. A logo has been developed; we have sourced and engaged a third-party manufacturer and our initial hot sauce order has been manufactured; we have sourced a third-party company to store and ship product as sales materialize; and we have established a web site; www.fruitwithfire.com. While no revenues have been recognized as of July 31
FWF Holdings Inc. intends to focus on selling a fruit based hot sauce product in a market segment filled with competition. Our approach is to take our proposed product image up-market because of our uncompromising view of our proposed product. Many low-end sauces are built around a base of vinegar; FWF sauce will be built around fresh peppers
 fruit and other natural ingredients. Initially FWF intends to focus its marketing efforts to specialty food stores
 through its own website
The keys to success will be the Company&#8217;s ability to differentiate ourselves from all others. We intend to stress authenticity of the ingredients and the heritage of the family recipe. We intend to position our proposed product at the high end of the market
 in terms of price. To provide a specialty product that will be different in taste from the &#8220;large volume&#8221; producers such as Tabasco
During the next 12 months
There is the likelihood that we may never be able to market our niche hot sauce product that the Company would need to successfully complete and implement its plan of operation. If our company is not capable of building a market for its product

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; In addition to historical financial information
 the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks
FWF Holdings Inc. is a Hot Sauce product business that will focus on selling its hot sauce product with a blend of peppers
 fruits
 herbs and spices under the brand name &#8220;Fruit With Fire&#8221;. The Company has targeted four main customer groups to sell its product. The first group is specialty food stores

The Company has begun to implement its business model. A logo has been developed; we have sourced and engaged a third-party manufacturer and our initial hot sauce order has been manufactured; we have sourced a third-party company to store and ship product as sales materialize; and we have established a web site; www.fruitwithfire.com. While no revenues have been recognized as of July 31
We require additional financing to implement our Plan of Operation and sustain business operations. Currently
 we do not have any arrangements for financing and we may be unable to obtain financing when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors
 including the Company&#8217;s ability to attract customers. The Company may be unable to access to capital markets in the future or that financing
 adequate to satisfy the cash requirements of implementing our business strategies
During the next 12 months
Over the 12 month period starting upon the effective date of this registration statement
 our company must raise capital to introduce its planned product and start sales. We intend to market our product through wholesales
We have completed the first phase of our planned operations which was to source out potential co-packing companies and manufactures to establish a hot sauce product (&#8220;Fruit With Fire&#8221;); and to secure the services of contractors to develop our logo
The second phase of our planned operations
 we intend to produce our product with inventory ready for marketing samples and for product sale. Our initial order has been manufactured by AKI. Further during the period we received our first purchase order. We intend to engage a Search Engine Optimization firm that will assist us
 not only identifying to successfully market our product over the internet but to ensure a high presence and to achieve a high search engine ranking. We also intend to do some traditional print advertising. Estimated annual cost for these services is $26
The third phase of our planned operations will be to launch our website and begin our sales and marketing campaign. Estimated cost for sales and marketing campaign and attending/exhibiting in trade shows as mentioned in phase 2 is $54
000. We expect to have the third phase completed with the next 12 months. With anticipate generating revenues within twelve months. We have received a purchase order of 42 cases of &#8220;Fruit With Fire&#8221; hot sauce during the period
 but as the product was not shipped prior to the end of the period
 the revenues were not recognized as of July 31
 2015. Total estimate expenditures for the next twelve months will be $150
Our auditor has indicated in their reports on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31
 2015
 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations
 deficit in equity
Fiscal Year Ended July 31
 2015 compared to Fiscal Year Ended July 31
While no revenues have been recognized from July 22
 2014 (inception) to July 31
 2015 the Company did receive a purchase order for 42 cases during the year ended July 31
 2015. The sale was not recognized as the product was not shipped during the period ended July 31
Expenses for the year ended July 31
 2015 totaled $27
221 consisting primarily of office and general expenses of $10
721 and professional fees of $16
500
 resulting in a net loss of $27
221. Expenses for the period from July 22
 2014 (date of inception) to July 31
 2014 totaled $2
204 consisting primarily of office and general expenses of $1
204 and professional fees of $1
000
 resulting in a net loss of $2
As of July 31
 2015
 we had $454 of cash and $2
410 in inventory compared to $9
990 of cash and nil in inventory for the year ended July 31
 2014. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from financing activities will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. To date the Company has incurred operating losses since inception of $29
425. As at July 31
 2015
 the Company has a working capital deficit of $9
The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. Our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
We expect to incur marketing and professional and administrative expenses as well expenses associated with maintaining our filings with the Commission. We will require additional funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital. If we are unable to obtain additional financing
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities
 which could harm our business plans
 financial condition and operating results. Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms
 if at all. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of equity or debt financing and advances from related parties. Any inability to raise capital as needed would have a material adverse effect on our business
If we cannot raise additional funds
 we will have to cease business operations. As a result
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements currently contemplated by management or in place that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the business

FWF HOLDINGS
 INC. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on July 22
To date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $29
425. As at July 31
 2015
 the Company has working capital deficit of $9
834. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. As of July 31
 2015
 the Company has issued 1
150
000
000 founders shares at $0.000008695 per share for net proceeds of $10
000 to the Company; and the founder shareholder returned 1

800
000 common shares at $0.000261 per share for net proceeds of $9
600 to the Company. On March 26
 2015
 the directors of the Company approved a special resolution to undertake a forward split of the common stock of the Company on a basis of 115 new common shares for 1 old common share. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts

For purposes of the statement of cash flows
FWF HOLDINGS
July 31
We value our inventories at the lower of cost
 determined on a first-in
 first-out method
 or market value. Our inventory consists solely of finished goods. We review inventories on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for estimated excess
 slow moving and obsolete inventory
 as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current assessment of future product demand
Revenue consists of revenue earned for the sale of &#8220;Fruit With Fire&#8221; hot sauce. Revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer. During the period the Company received a purchase order for 42 cases. This sale was not recognized as revenue during the period as the product had not been shipped as of July 31
All significant financial assets
 financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
The Company follows ASC 718-10
 Stock Compensation
 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at July 31

In June 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-10
 &#8220;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#8221;. The guidance eliminates the definition of a development stage entity thereby removing the incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 primarily presentation of inception to date financial information. The provisions of the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 and the interim periods therein. However
 early adoption is permitted. Accordingly
 the Company has adopted this standard as of July 31
In August 2014
 FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 201415 Preparation of Financial Statements &#8211; Going Concern (Subtopic 20540)
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity's liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity's liquidation becomes imminent
 financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 20530
 Presentation of Financial Statements&#8212; Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Even when an entity's liquidation is not imminent
 there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations
 financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting
 but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU
 however
 at the current period
In January 2015
 FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 201501 Income Statement &#8211; Extraordinary and Unusual Items
 Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Eliminating the concept of extraordinary items will save time and reduce costs for preparers because they will not have to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is extraordinary (even if they ultimately would conclude it is not). This also alleviates uncertainty for preparers
 auditors
 and regulators because auditors and regulators no longer will need to evaluate whether a preparer treated an unusual and/or infrequent item appropriately. This update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
As of July 31
 2015 the Company had 161 cases containing 12 bottles per case (1
932 bottles). During the period the Company received a purchase order for 42 cases. This sale was not recognized as revenue during the period as the product had not been shipped as of July 31

The amount taken into income as deferred income tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is more likely-than-not to be realized from future operations. The Company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against all available income tax loss carry forwards. The Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance is reviewed annually. When circumstances change and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets
As of July 31

There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants regarding our accounting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment
 management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31
The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company&#8217;s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company's Chief Financial Officer in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of July 31
Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2)
 (3) and (4) above did not have an affect on the Company's financial results. However
 management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors
We are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment
Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors
 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
 will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's Board. In addition
 management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further
We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the small business issuer's last fiscal year that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements

 INC. was incorporated in the&#13;State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on July 22

425. As at July 31
 2015
 the Company has&#13;working capital deficit of $9
834. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated&#13;operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial&#13;business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&amp;#146;s&#13;ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances&#13;from related parties as may be required. As of July 31
 2015
 the Company has issued 1
150
000
000 founders shares at $0.000008695&#13;per share for net proceeds of $10
000 to the Company; and the founder shareholder returned 1
035
000
000 restricted shares at $0.0000000009&#13;for a cost of $10 to the Company; and issued by way of private placements to 32 individuals 36
800
000 common shares at $0.000261&#13;per share for net proceeds of $9
600 to the Company. On March 26
 2015
 the directors of the Company approved a special resolution&#13;to undertake a forward split of the common stock of the Company on a basis of 115 new common shares for 1 old common share. These&#13;financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts



 statements of operations

 &amp;#147;Disclosure about Segments&#13;of an Enterprise and Related Information&amp;#148;
 changed the way public companies report information about segments of their business&#13;in their quarterly reports issued to shareholders. It also requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services the&#13;entity provides

&amp;#148; establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements.&#13;As at July 31
 2015
 the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and
 therefore



&#13;determined on a first-in
 first-out method
 or market value. Our inventory consists solely of finished goods. We review inventories&#13;on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for estimated excess
 slow moving and obsolete inventory
 as well as inventory&#13;with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current&#13;assessment of future product demand


&#13;financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements&#13;together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows


&#13;&amp;#34;Stock Compensation&amp;#34;
 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity&#13;instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in&#13;share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 &amp;#34;Accounting for Stock-Based&#13;Compensation
&amp;#34; and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (&amp;#34;APB&amp;#34;) Opinion No. 25
 &amp;#34;Accounting for Stock&#13;Issued to Employees
&amp;#34; and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee&#13;services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with&#13;limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must&#13;be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at July 31

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-10
&#13;&amp;#147;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment&#13;to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&amp;#148;. The guidance eliminates the definition of a development&#13;stage entity thereby removing the incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 primarily&#13;presentation of inception to date financial information. The provisions of the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods&#13;beginning after December 15
 2014
 and the interim periods therein. However
 early adoption is permitted. Accordingly
 the Company&#13;has adopted this standard as of July 31

 FASB issued Accounting Standards&#13;Update (ASU) No. 201415 Preparation of Financial Statements &amp;#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 20540)
 Disclosure of Uncertainties&#13;about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 continuation of&#13;a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity's&#13;liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern&#13;basis of accounting. If and when an entity's liquidation becomes imminent
 financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation&#13;basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 20530
 Presentation of Financial Statements&amp;#151; Liquidation Basis of Accounting.&#13;Even when an entity's liquidation is not imminent
 there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's&#13;ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations
 financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going&#13;concern basis of accounting
 but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information&#13;about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December&#13;15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the&#13;going concern considerations in this ASU
 however
 at the current period

 FASB issued Accounting Standards&#13;Update (ASU) No. 201501 Income Statement &amp;#150; Extraordinary and Unusual Items
 Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by&#13;Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Eliminating the concept of extraordinary items will save time and reduce costs&#13;for preparers because they will not have to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is extraordinary (even if they&#13;ultimately would conclude it is not). This also alleviates uncertainty for preparers
 auditors
 and regulators because auditors&#13;and regulators no longer will need to evaluate whether a preparer treated an unusual and/or infrequent item appropriately. This&#13;update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15

&#13;&amp;#34;Stock Compensation&amp;#34;
 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity&#13;instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in&#13;share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 &amp;#34;Accounting for Stock-Based&#13;Compensation
&amp;#34; and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (&amp;#34;APB&amp;#34;) Opinion No. 25
 &amp;#34;Accounting for Stock&#13;Issued to Employees
&amp;#34; and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee&#13;services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with&#13;limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must&#13;be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at July 31


 the FASB issued ASU 2014-10
&#13;&amp;#147;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment&#13;to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&amp;#148;. The guidance eliminates the definition of a development&#13;stage entity thereby removing the incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 primarily&#13;presentation of inception to date financial information. The provisions of the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods&#13;beginning after December 15
 2014
 and the interim periods therein. However
 early adoption is permitted. Accordingly
 the Company&#13;has adopted this standard as of July 31

 FASB issued Accounting Standards&#13;Update (ASU) No. 201415 Preparation of Financial Statements &amp;#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 20540)
 Disclosure of Uncertainties&#13;about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 continuation of&#13;a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity's&#13;liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern&#13;basis of accounting. If and when an entity's liquidation becomes imminent
 financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation&#13;basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 20530
 Presentation of Financial Statements&amp;#151; Liquidation Basis of Accounting.&#13;Even when an entity's liquidation is not imminent
 there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's&#13;ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations
 financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going&#13;concern basis of accounting
 but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information&#13;about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December&#13;15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the&#13;going concern considerations in this ASU
 however
 at the current period

 FASB issued Accounting Standards&#13;Update (ASU) No. 201501 Income Statement &amp;#150; Extraordinary and Unusual Items
 Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by&#13;Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Eliminating the concept of extraordinary items will save time and reduce costs&#13;for preparers because they will not have to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is extraordinary (even if they&#13;ultimately would conclude it is not). This also alleviates uncertainty for preparers
 auditors
 and regulators because auditors&#13;and regulators no longer will need to evaluate whether a preparer treated an unusual and/or infrequent item appropriately. This&#13;update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15

sheet
 statements of operations
 stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented
in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.




 &#147;Disclosure about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information&#148;
 changed the way public companies report information about segments of their business
in their quarterly reports issued to shareholders. It also requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services the
entity provides
 the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues and its major customers.




Income
&#148; establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements.
As at July 31
 2015
 the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and
 therefore
 has not included a schedule of
comprehensive loss in the financial statements.




in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly
 actual results could
differ from those estimates.




the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.




determined on a first-in
 first-out method
 or market value. Our inventory consists solely of finished goods. We review inventories
on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for estimated excess
 slow moving and obsolete inventory
 as well as inventory
with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current
assessment of future product demand
 historical experience and obsolete finished product.




sale of &#147;Fruit With Fire&#148; hot sauce. Revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer. During
the period the Company received a purchase order for 42 cases. This sale was not recognized as revenue during the period as the
product had not been shipped as of July 31
 2015.




financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements
together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows
 interest rate risk and
credit risk. Where practical the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and
disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.




by dividing the Company&#146;s net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during
the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common
shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number
of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings
(loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.




accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted
tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the date of enactment or substantive enactment.




&#34;Stock Compensation&#34;
 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 &#34;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation
&#34; and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (&#34;APB&#34;) Opinion No. 25
 &#34;Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees
&#34; and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee
services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with
limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must
be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at July 31
 2015 the
Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has
been recorded to date.




 the FASB issued ASU 2014-10
&#147;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment
to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#148;. The guidance eliminates the definition of a development
stage entity thereby removing the incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 primarily
presentation of inception to date financial information. The provisions of the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15
 2014
 and the interim periods therein. However
 early adoption is permitted. Accordingly
 the Company
has adopted this standard as of July 31
 2014.


 FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 201415 Preparation of Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 20540)
 Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 continuation of
a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity's
liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern
basis of accounting. If and when an entity's liquidation becomes imminent
 financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation
basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 20530
 Presentation of Financial Statements&#151; Liquidation Basis of Accounting.
Even when an entity's liquidation is not imminent
 there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's
ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations
 financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going
concern basis of accounting
 but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information
about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December
15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the
going concern considerations in this ASU
 however
 at the current period
 management does not believe that it has met the conditions
which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure. Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements
issued since the last audit of its financial statements. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will
not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.


 FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 201501 Income Statement &#150; Extraordinary and Unusual Items
 Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by
Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Eliminating the concept of extraordinary items will save time and reduce costs
for preparers because they will not have to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is extraordinary (even if they
ultimately would conclude it is not). This also alleviates uncertainty for preparers
 auditors
 and regulators because auditors
and regulators no longer will need to evaluate whether a preparer treated an unusual and/or infrequent item appropriately. This
update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2015. Early application
is permitted.


pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new
accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

 2014 and established a fiscal year end of July 31. The Company is organized

from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $29
425. As at July 31
 2015
 the Company has
working capital deficit of $9
834. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated
operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial
business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&#146;s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances
from related parties as may be required. As of July 31
 2015
 the Company has issued 1
150

000 common shares at $0.000261
per share for net proceeds of $9
600 to the Company. On March 26
 2015
 the directors of the Company approved a special resolution
to undertake a forward split of the common stock of the Company on a basis of 115 new common shares for 1 old common share. These

The financial statements present the balance
sheet
 statements of operations
 stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented
in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.




FSAB ASC 280
 &#147;Disclosure about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information&#148;
 changed the way public companies report information about segments of their business
in their quarterly reports issued to shareholders. It also requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services the
entity provides
 the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues and its major customers.




&#147;Reporting Comprehensive
Income
&#148; establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements.
As at July 31
 2015
 the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and
 therefore
 has not included a schedule of
comprehensive loss in the financial statements.





Preparation of the financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly
 actual results could
differ from those estimates.




For purposes of the statement of cash flows
the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.




We value our inventories at the lower of cost
determined on a first-in
 first-out method
 or market value. Our inventory consists solely of finished goods. We review inventories
on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for estimated excess
 slow moving and obsolete inventory
 as well as inventory
with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current
assessment of future product demand
 historical experience and obsolete finished product.




Revenue consists of revenue earned for the
sale of &#147;Fruit With Fire&#148; hot sauce. Revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer. During
the period the Company received a purchase order for 42 cases. This sale was not recognized as revenue during the period as the
product had not been shipped as of July 31
 2015.




All significant financial assets
financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements
together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows
 interest rate risk and
credit risk. Where practical the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and
disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.




The basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated
by dividing the Company&#146;s net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during
the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common
shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number
of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings
(loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.




The Company follows the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted
tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the date of enactment or substantive enactment.




The Company follows ASC 718-10
&#34;Stock Compensation&#34;
 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 &#34;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation
&#34; and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (&#34;APB&#34;) Opinion No. 25
 &#34;Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees
&#34; and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee
services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with
limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must
be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at July 31
 2015 the
Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has
been recorded to date.




In June 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-10
&#147;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment
to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#148;. The guidance eliminates the definition of a development
stage entity thereby removing the incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 primarily
presentation of inception to date financial information. The provisions of the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15
 2014
 and the interim periods therein. However
 early adoption is permitted. Accordingly
 the Company
has adopted this standard as of July 31
 2014.


 FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 201415 Preparation of Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 20540)
 Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 continuation of
a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity's
liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern
basis of accounting. If and when an entity's liquidation becomes imminent
 financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation
basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 20530
 Presentation of Financial Statements&#151; Liquidation Basis of Accounting.
Even when an entity's liquidation is not imminent
 there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's
ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations
 financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going
concern basis of accounting
 but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information
about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December
15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the
going concern considerations in this ASU
 however
 at the current period
 management does not believe that it has met the conditions
which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure. Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements
issued since the last audit of its financial statements. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will
not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.


 FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 201501 Income Statement &#150; Extraordinary and Unusual Items
 Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by
Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. Eliminating the concept of extraordinary items will save time and reduce costs
for preparers because they will not have to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is extraordinary (even if they
ultimately would conclude it is not). This also alleviates uncertainty for preparers
 auditors
 and regulators because auditors
and regulators no longer will need to evaluate whether a preparer treated an unusual and/or infrequent item appropriately. This
update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15

 the
impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.
