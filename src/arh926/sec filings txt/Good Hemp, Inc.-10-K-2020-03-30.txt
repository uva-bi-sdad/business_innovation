Non-alcoholic beverages are among the most widely distributed food products in the world and are being sold through more than 400

 our core market. The United States has more than 2
600 beverage companies and 500 bottlers of beverage products. Collectively they account for more than $100 billion in annual sales. It is estimated that globally more than $300 billion worth of non-alcoholic beverages are sold annually. The beverage market is controlled by two giants
 The Coca-Cola Company (&#8220;Coke&#8221;) and PepsiCo
 combining for over 70% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. Carbonated beverage sales are slipping

Direct Store Delivery (&#8220;DSD&#8221; ) - DSD players
 and regional and local distributors touch over 90% of retail chains in the US. DSDs primarily distribute beverages
 chips
 snacks and milk and provide pre-sales
Direct to Retail Channel (&#8220;Warehouse Direct&#8221;) - We are targeting listings with large retail convenience store and grocery store chains where we ship direct to the chain stores warehousing system. Retailers must have warehousing and delivery capabilities. Services to retailers will be provided by an assigned broker
 approved by us
 to oversee pre-sale and merchandising services. Our direct to retail channel of distribution is an important part of our strategy to target large national or regional restaurant chains
 retail accounts
 including mass merchandisers and premier food-service businesses. Through these programs
 we will negotiate directly with the retailer to carry our products
Our strategy is to outsource the manufacturing and warehousing of our products to independent contract manufacturers (&#8220;co-packers&#8221;). We will purchase our raw materials from North American suppliers which deliver to our third-party co-packers. We will use two or more co-packers to manufacture and package our products. Once our products are manufactured
 we store finished product in a warehouse adjacent to each co-packer or in third party warehouses. Our copackers will be chosen based on their proximity to markets covered by our distributors. Most of the ingredients used in the formulation of our products are off-the shelf and thus readily available. No ingredient has a lead time greater than two weeks. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production run for most co-packers
 we will not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. Our co-packers may terminate their arrangements with us at any time
Substantially all the raw materials used in the preparation
 bottling and packaging of our products will be purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers in accordance with our specifications. The raw materials used in the preparation and packaging of our products will consist primarily of juice concentrates
 natural flavors
 stevia
 pure cane sugar
 bottles
 labels
 trays and enclosures. These raw materials will be purchased from suppliers selected by us or by our contract manufacturers. We believe that we have adequate sources of raw materials
We will purchase our flavor concentrate from several flavor concentrate suppliers. Generally
 all natural flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to the flavors. About the development of new products and flavors
 independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense for product development
 thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. We anticipate that for future flavors and additional products
 we may purchase flavor concentrate from other flavor houses with the intention of developing other sources of flavor concentrate for each of our products. If we must replace a flavor supplier
 we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers
Our product philosophy will continue to be based on developing products in those segments of the market that offer the greatest chance of success such as health
 wellness and natural refreshment and rehydration
 and we will continue to seek out underserved market niches. We believe we can quickly respond
 given our technical and marketing expertise
 to changing market conditions with new and innovative products. We are committed to developing products that are distinct
 meet a quantifiable need
 are proprietary
 lend themselves to at least a 30% gross profit
 project a quality and healthy image
We own the following intellectual property: Good Hemp&#174; trademark
 Good Hemp 2oh!
 Good Hemp fizz!
Our sales are expected to be seasonal and experience fluctuations in quarterly results because of many factors. Historically
 the industry experiences an increase in revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. Thus
We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 commonly referred to as the JOBS Act. We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years
 or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion
 (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
As an &#8220;emerging growth company
&#8221; we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including
not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (we also will not be subject to the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) as long as we are a &#8220;smaller reporting company
In addition
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision
 an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. In other words
 an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of such accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies until the first to occur of the date the subject company (i) is no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B). The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period and
 as a result
 our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. Accordingly
 until the date that we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B)
 upon the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to your financial statements and has a different effective date for public and private companies

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Principal Executive and Financial Officers of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K. Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 such as this Form 10-K
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management
 including our Principal Executive and Financial Officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation
 our management concluded that
 as of December 31
 2019
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. However
 a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance
 however
 that the objectives of the controls system are met
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission
 internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by
 or under the supervision of the company&#8217;s Principal Executive and Financial Officers and implemented by its Board of Directors
 management and other personnel
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
The Company&#8217;s Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019
 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
Based on this evaluation
 management concluded that the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31
the Company did not maintain adequate segregation of duties related to job responsibilities for initiating
 authorizing
Notwithstanding the above
 a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
Additionally
The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term &#8220;disclosure controls and procedures&#8221; to mean the company's controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a simple system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded
 processed
As of the end of the period covered by this report
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation
 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objectives of timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports and of ensuring that such information is recorded
 processed
There was no change in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected

 William Alessi
 our CEO and a director
 was issued 1
000 shares of common stock and 30
000
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A Preferred Shares (&#8220;Class A Preferred Stock&#8221;). Each share of Class A Preferred Stock is convertible into 100 shares of Company common stock
 subject to adjustment
As set out in the Company&#8217;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 12
 2019
 Mr. Alessi
 the Company&#8217;s CEO and a director
 returned 12
000
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A Preferred Stock to the Company for cancellation. Prior to the cancellation
 Mr. Alessi owned 24

000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A Preferred Stock
 and after Mr. Alessi&#8217;s cancellation and the issuance of the Shares to Mr. Spoone
 Mr. Alessi and Mr. Spoone each owned 12
000
The cancellation of Mr. Alessi&#8217;s Class A Preferred Shares
 and the issuance of the Class A Preferred Shares to Mr. Spoone (the &#8220;Cancellation and Issuance&#8221;)
 constituted a change in control of the Company as each share of Class A Preferred Stock entitled the holder thereof to 100 votes per share

361
963 shares of Company common stock outstanding
 and 30
000

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results

The FASB issued ASC 820-10
 
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs

 - The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times

Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606. The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (iii) determine the transaction price
 (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
 and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606
 including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception
 once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue

The Company computes net income or loss per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Under the provisions of the Earnings per Share Topic ASC

For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities
 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date

 which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees except for certain circumstances. Any transition impact will be a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15

 an accumulated deficit and a working capital deficiency. Management&#8217;s plans include raising capital in the debt and equity markets. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until its operations become established enough to be considered reliably profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital
The Company operates in the United States; accordingly

 &lt;em&gt;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures &lt;/em&gt;
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs

The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has recurring operating losses
 an accumulated deficit and a working capital deficiency. Management&#8217;s plans include raising capital in the debt and equity markets. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until its operations become established enough to be considered reliably profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital
 it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
For purposes of the statement of cash flows

The FASB issued ASC 820-10
 
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices
 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active
 - The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times
 its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company&#8217;s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds

Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606. The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (iii) determine the transaction price
 (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
 and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606
 including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception
 once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606
 the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue

The Company computes net income or loss per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Under the provisions of the Earnings per Share Topic ASC

In June 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU No. 2018-07
 Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting
 which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees except for certain circumstances. Any transition impact will be a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within that annual period and early adoption is permitted. We have adopted this guidance on January 1
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which will require organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required
 and optional practical expedients may be elected. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within that annual period. Subsequent amendments to the initial guidance have been issued in January 2017
 January 2018
 and July 2018 within ASU No. 2017-03
 ASU No. 2018-01
 ASU No. 2018-10
 and ASU No. 2018-11 regarding qualitative disclosures
 optional practical expedients
 codification improvements and an optional transition method to adopt with a cumulative-effect adjustment versus a modified retrospective approach. These updates do not change the core principle of the guidance under ASU No. 2016-02
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13
 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework &#8211; Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement
 which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurement by removing
 modifying
 and adding certain disclosures. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2019
In August 2018
 the SEC adopted amendments to simplify certain disclosure requirements
 as set forth in Securities Act Release No. 33-10532
 Disclosure Update and Simplification
 which includes a requirement for entities to present the changes in shareholders&#8217; equity in the interim financial statements in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. This amendment is effective for all filings made on or after November 5
 2018. In light of the timing of effectiveness of the amendment and proximity to the filing date for most filers&#8217; quarterly reports
 the SEC has allowed for a filer&#8217;s first presentation of the changes in shareholders&#8217; equity to be included in its Form 10-Q for the quarter that begins after the effective date. We do not expect his pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
