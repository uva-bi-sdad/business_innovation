Montalvo Spirits
 Inc. (Formerly Advanced Cloud Storage
 Inc.)

&#160;Montalvo Spirits
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on November 18
 2010 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of Advanced Cloud Storage
 Inc. The Company originally intended to market and sell its planned secure online data storage through its intended website.




&#160;On December 21

CASA Montalvo Holdings
 Inc.

&#160;CASA Montalvo Holdings
 Inc. (&#8220;Casa Montalvo&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on April 4
 2011. Casa Montalvo develops
 markets and/or distributes alcoholic beverages
 primarily in the United States.






















&#160;On August 9
 2012
 the Company formed Montalvo Imports LLC (&#8220;LLC&#8221; or &#8220;Imports&#8221;) under the laws of the State of Delaware. &#160;The LLC
 of which the Company is the sole member
 was formed to provide the same services as that of the Company.


Formation of Cannabis Beverage Group
 Inc.

&#160;On March 27
 2014
 the Company formed Cannabis Beverage Group
 Inc. (&#8220;CBG&#8221;) under the laws of the State of Colorado.&#160;&#160;CBG
 of which the Company is the sole shareholder
 was formed to explore entry into the cannabis based beverage industry.




&#160;On December 21
 2012
 the Company
 entered into and consummated the Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;) with Casa Montalvo and the shareholders of Casa Montalvo (the &#8220;Exchange&#8221;). Upon consummation of the transactions set forth in the Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Closing&#8221;)
 the Registrant adopted the business plan of Casa Montalvo.

&#160;Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement
 the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Casa Montalvo in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate for 59
000
016 post-split (pre-split 1
817
891) shares of the Registrant&#8217;s Common Stock (the &#8220;Exchange Shares&#8221;). As a result of the Exchange
 Casa Montalvo became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant. The shareholders of Casa Montalvo beneficially owned approximately eighty-eight and one half percent (88.5%) of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Registrant immediately after the consummation of the Exchange. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement
 the Registrant&#8217;s principal shareholder agreed to retire 10
000
000 shares of the Registrant&#8217;s Common Stock.

&#160;As a result of the controlling financial interest of the former stockholder of Casa Montalvo
 for financial statement reporting purposes
 the merger between the Company and Casa Montalvo has been treated as a reverse acquisition with Casa Montalvo deemed the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed the accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with section 805-10-55 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.&#160;&#160;The reverse acquisition is deemed a capital transaction and the net assets of Casa Montalvo (the accounting acquirer) are carried forward to the Company (the legal acquirer and the reporting entity) at their carrying value before the acquisition.&#160;&#160;The acquisition process utilizes the capital structure of the Company and the assets and liabilities of Casa Montalvo which are recorded at their historical cost.&#160;&#160;The equity of the Company is the historical equity of Casa Montalvo retroactively restated to reflect the number of shares issued by the Company in the transaction.




&#160;We develop
 market and/or distribute alcoholic beverages
 primarily in the United States. We sell our products through a network of established spirits distributors
 who are licensed to distribute alcoholic beverages throughout the United States. We are federally licensed
 maintaining the right to sell to distributors in all markets in the U.S. and globally.

&#160;We intend to focus on growing the market share of our initial products
 the ultra-premium Montalvo line of tequilas
 whose expressions include Plata
 Reposado
 Anejo and Extra-Anejo. We own the Montalvo brand trademark and have exclusive worldwide master distribution rights to the brands.

&#160;We intend to grow our business by expanding our portfolio of premium alcoholic beverage brands
 including additional spirits categories
 as well as beer and wine
 through additional importation and distribution contracts of existing brands. In addition
 we may choose to develop new brands or acquire existing companies with their own brand portfolios.





















&#160;While our primary route to market is by selling directly to distributors
 who maintain extensive resources to sell to both on and off premise retail accounts
 including liquor stores
 grocery stores
 convenience stores
 bars and restaurants
 to build our brands
 we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: the distributors; the retail trade; and the end consumer. We believe advertising
 marketing and promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image and perception of our brand as we strive in building substantial brand value.

&#160;In control states
 the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. We would sell on consignment to any control state in which we do business
 we would provide inventory to state regulated stores and would be paid upon sale of the product. Should the inventory we provide not sell in a timely manner or at all
 this could negatively impact our working capital and tie up our inventory for an unknown period of time.&#160;&#160;We currently do business in two control states
 Oregon and Wyoming.

&#160;Marketing
 sales and customer service functions are provided by our executive officers and independent contractors who work together with third party design and advertising firms to maintain a high degree of focus on each of our products. We attempt to build brand awareness through innovative marketing activities including social media
 brand tastings
 as well as competitive spirits competitions. We use a variety of marketing strategies and tactics to build brand equity and increase sales
 including consumer and trade advertising
 price promotions
 point-of-sale materials
 event sponsorship
 in-store and on-premise promotions and public relations
 as well as a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques. Our significant public relations campaign has helped gain editorial coverage for our brands
 which increases brand awareness. We define editorial coverage as an article in a publication expressing the opinion of its editors or publishers. Montalvo Tequila has been featured in various industry publications
 including Tasting Panel Magazine
 Beverage Industry and M. Shanken&#8217;s Market Watch. Past and future event sponsorship is an economical way for us to have influential consumers taste our brands.




&#160;We have an Exclusive Worldwide Distribution Agreement with Destilidora Huerta Real
 S.A. de C.V.
 the producers of Montalvo Tequila. Montalvo
 an award winning
 ultra-premium tequila brand is a handcrafted
 meticulously formulated tequila produced from only the highest quality blue agave plants from the Lowlands of Jalisco
 Mexico. Montalvo ensures the brand&#8217;s premium quality by handcrafting in small batches
 using hand-selected Blue Weber agave plants picked at the peak of maturity and employing a third distillation. Fourth-generation tequila producers Sergio and Carlos Gonzalez Rivera have combined their family&#8217;s ancient traditions with modern techniques
 resulting in a clean
 smooth and memorable tequila. Montalvo is available in four expressions: Plata
 Reposado
 A&#241;ejo and Extra-A&#241;ejo.




&#160;We maintain a relatively large inventory based on historical revenues in order to meet unknown customer delivery requirements of new independent distributors we are in the process of securing. We feel that the current production capacity of our primary supplier is sufficient to meet demand for the foreseeable future. In case of an unexpected surge in demand
 our primary supplier maintains contract manufacturing arrangements with third-party suppliers capable of producing large-scale volumes of our products. Based on the relatively short turnaround time from placing an order with our supplier to receiving the product
 we believe it will be able to effectively manage our inventory in the face of unknown demand.




&#160;Pursuant to the Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Destilidora Huerta Real
 S.A. de C.V.
 we own the trademark &#8220;Montalvo&#8221;. The trademark is registered in the United States
 Mexico
 Colombia
 Brazil and Argentina
 and is currently pending in the European Union. We consider the trademark to be valuable and important to our business.






















&#160;The U.S. alcoholic beverage industry is a regulated
 three-tier system of suppliers
 distributors and retailers. We currently distribute the Montalvo Tequila brand through a network of independent distributors. We also maintain an arrangement with MHW
 Ltd.
 a third-party leading service provider to alcoholic beverage companies
 to import the Montalvo brand into the U.S. as well as to sell Montalvo directly to retailers in New York
 New Jersey and California. We hope to expand the number of independent distributors in certain existing markets and new markets
 when we have sufficient funds to maintain a larger marketing campaign.




&#160;The alcohol beverage industry is highly competitive. We compete with other alcohol beverage companies
 most of which have significantly more sales and resources than us
 and have been in business for much longer than we have. We compete with national and regional beverage producers and private label suppliers. Some of our largest competitors are Diageo PLC
 Pernod Ricard S.A.
 Bacardi Limited
 Brown-Forman Corporation
 Beam Inc.
 Remy Cointreau S.A. and Constellation Brands
 Inc.

&#160;Over the last decade
 the wine and spirits industry in the United States has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership. The number of major importers
 suppliers and distributors in the U.S. has declined significantly due to this consolidation. As a result
 we believe there is a great opportunity for smaller companies to develop high-quality
 high-margin brands
 which can grow to be very attractive acquisition candidates for the larger companies.

&#160;We believe that we compete on the basis of quality
 price
 brand recognition and distribution strength. By focusing on the premium and super-premium segments of the market
 which typically have higher margins
 we believe we are able to gain relatively significant attention from our distributors for a company of our size. Our U.S. sales force have built
 and should continue to build sound
 long standing relationships with distributors both locally and nationally as well as with their customers. Finally
 with the continued consolidation among the major companies that we have seen and expect to continue to see
 we feel there is an opportunity for small to mid-size spirits companies such as ours
 as the major companies contract their portfolios to focus on fewer brands.

&#160;There can be no assurance that we will compete successfully with existing or new competitors
 or that the competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business
 operating results or financial condition (See ITEM 1A &#8220;RISK FACTORS&#8221;).




&#160;We currently have no full time employees other than our executive officers. Our sales and marketing team consists of eight (8) independent contractors
 which are all at-will contractors. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.




&#160;Our auditors have issued a &#8220;going concern&#8221; opinion
 meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business.

&#160;As of March 31
 2014
 we had $20
143 in cash
 $35
171 in accounts receivable and $308
213 in inventories
 totaling $363
527 in assets as compared to $385
988 in total assets for March 31
 2013. The funds available to us will not be sufficient to fund our planned operations. If we do not substantially increase our sales
 we will require funding to continue our operations of which there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise funds or that if we do so that they will be on grounds that are favorable to us.






















&#160;Members of management may serve in the future as an officer
 director or investor in other entities. Neither the Company nor any shareholder would have any interest in these projects. Management believes that they have sufficient resources to fully discharge their responsibilities to all projects they have organized or will organize in the future
 if any.




&#160;The production and marketing of our alcoholic beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of various Federal
 provincial
 state and local health agencies
 including in particular the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (&#8220;TTB&#8221;) as well as the Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws of all states in which our products are sold. The TTB also regulates labeling of our products.

&#160;We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal
 state
 and other regulations and that we have a compliance program in place to ensure compliance with production
 marketing and labeling regulations on a going-forward basis. There are no regulatory notifications or actions currently outstanding.

&#160;We currently do not incur any material costs in connection with our compliance with applicable environmental laws. Furthermore
 the cost of maintaining compliance with applicable environmental laws has not
 and we believe
 in the future
 will not
 have a material adverse effect on our business
 results of operations and financial condition.






&#160;We intend to make available through our website
 all of our filings with the Commission and all amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing
 by providing a hyperlink to the EDGAR website containing our reports.




&#160;The Company is required to file annual
 quarterly and special reports
 proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). Investors may read and copy any document that the Company files
 including this Annual Report on Form 10-K

 DC 20549. Investors may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition
 the SEC maintains an Internet site at&#160;http://www.sec.gov&#160;that contains reports
 proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC
 from which investors can electronically access the Company&#8217;s SEC filings.

&#160;Our business
 financial condition
 operating results and prospects are subject to the following risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently foreseeable to us may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs
 our business
 financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. In such case
 the trading price of our Common Stock could decline
 and our stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in the shares of our Common Stock.

&#160;This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as &#8220;believes
&#8221; &#8220;expects
&#8221; &#8220;intends
&#8221; &#8220;plans
&#8221; &#8220;may
&#8221; &#8220;will
&#8221; &#8220;should
&#8221; or &#8220;anticipation&#8221; or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward- looking statements as a result of certain factors
 including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.






&#160;We have very limited funds
 and such funds are not adequate to develop our current business plan. We believe that for our company to be successful
 we will be required to spend significant sums to market our products. If the sales of our products do not enable us to meet this need
 our ultimate success may depend on our ability to raise additional capital. In the absence of additional financing or significant revenues and profits
 the we will have to approach our business plan from a much different and much more restricted direction
 attempting to secure additional funding sources to fund our growth
 borrowing money from lenders or elsewhere or to take other actions to attempt to provide funding. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed
 or that such funds
 if available
 will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us.






&#160;Investors must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies
 particularly in rapidly evolving and changing markets. Such risks include the following:























ability to effectively manage expanding operations; amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business
 operations
 and infrastructure; and











&#160;We cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks. In the event that we do not successfully address these risks
 our business
 prospects
 financial condition
 and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may not have the resources to continue or expand our business operations.






















&#160;The worldwide and domestic economies have experienced adverse conditions and may be subject to further deterioration for the foreseeable future. We are subject to risks associated with these adverse conditions
 including economic slowdown and the disruption
 volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets. This global economic situation could adversely impact our major suppliers
 distributors and retailers. In addition
 unfavorable global or domestic economic situations could adversely impact our major suppliers
 distributors and retailers. Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or customers could result in product delays
 possible accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. The inability of suppliers
 distributors or retailers to conduct business or to access liquidity could impact our ability to distribute our products.

&#160;There can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future. A prolonged downturn
 further worsening or broadening of the adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products
 and create or exacerbate credit issues
 cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers
 distributors
 retailers and consumers. Depending upon their severity and duration
 these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business
 liquidity
 financial condition and results of operations. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in the financial markets and the adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other markets.


We depend on a limited number of suppliers. Failure to obtain satisfactory performance from our suppliers or loss of our existing suppliers could cause us to lose sales
 incur additional costs and lose credibility in the marketplace. We also have annual purchase obligations with certain suppliers.

&#160;We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the sourcing of all of our products
 including both our own proprietary brands and those we distribute for others. These suppliers consist of third-party distillers
 bottlers and producers in Mexico. For our proprietary products
 we may rely on a single supplier to fulfill one or all of the manufacturing functions for a brand. For instance
 Destilidora Huerta Real
 S.A. de C.V. is the sole producer for Montalvo Tequila. The termination of our written or oral agreements or an adverse change in the terms of these agreements could have a negative impact on our business. If our suppliers increase their prices
 we may not have alternative sources of supply and may not be able to raise the prices of our products to cover all or even a portion of the increased costs. Also
 our suppliers&#8217; failure to perform satisfactorily or handle increased orders
 delays in shipments of products from international suppliers or the loss of our existing suppliers
 especially our key suppliers
 could cause us to fail to meet orders for our products
 lose sales
 incur additional costs and/or expose us to product quality issues. In turn
 this could cause us to lose credibility in the marketplace and damage our relationships with distributors
 ultimately leading to a decline in our business and results of operations. If we are not able to renegotiate these contracts on acceptable terms or find suitable alternatives
 our business could be negatively impacted.



&#160;In the control states
 the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products selected for listing must generally reach certain volumes and/or profit levels to maintain their listings. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Products not selected for listings can only be purchased by consumers in the applicable control state through special orders
 if at all. If
 in the future
 we are unable to maintain our current listings in the control states
 or secure and maintain listings in those states for any additional products we may acquire
 sales of our products could decrease significantly.




















Currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations may have a significant adverse effect on our revenues
 sales
 costs of goods and overall financial results.

&#160;For fiscal 2014
 non-U.S. operations accounted for none of our revenues but we are dependent upon resources in Mexico for the products we intend to market
 distribute and sell. Therefore
 gains and losses on the conversion of foreign payments into U.S. dollars could cause fluctuations in our results of operations
 and fluctuating exchange rates could cause reduced revenues and/or gross margins from non-U.S. dollar-denominated international sales and inventory purchases. Our ability to acquire spirits and wine and produce and sell our products at favorable prices will also depend in part on the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. We may not be able to hedge against these risks.


If our inventory is lost due to theft
 fire or other damage or becomes obsolete
 our results of operations would be negatively impacted.

&#160;We expect our inventory levels to fluctuate to meet customer delivery requirements for our products. We are always at risk of loss of that inventory due to theft
 fire or other damage
 and any such loss
 whether insured against or not
 could cause us to fail to meet our orders and harm our sales and operating results. Also
 our inventory may become obsolete as we introduce new products
 cease to produce old products or modify the design of our products&#8217; packaging
 which would increase our operating losses and negatively impact our results of operations.




&#160;We operate in an industry where performance is affected by the weather. Extreme changes in weather conditions may result in lower consumption of tequila and other alcoholic beverages. In particular
 unusually cold spells in winter or high temperatures in the summer can result in temporary shifts in customer preferences and impact demand for the alcoholic beverages we produce and distribute. Similar weather conditions in the future may have a material adverse effect on our sales which could affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. In addition
 inclement weather may affect the availability of grain used to produce raw spirit
 which could result in a rise in raw spirit pricing that could negatively affect margins and sales.


Climate change
 or legal
 regulatory or market measures to address climate change
 may negatively affect our business
 operations or financial performance
 and water scarcity or poor quality could negatively impact our production costs and capacit

&#160;Our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources. There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures
 weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Severe weather events and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our agricultural raw materials such as agave. Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of our products. Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain
 which may affect production operations
 insurance cost and coverage
 as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers
 retailers and consumers.

&#160;Water is essential in the production of our products. The quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of agave and our ability to operate our business. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe
 there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints. Such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.





















&#160;The Company currently has an exclusive right to distribute all Casa Montalvo products throughout the world for a three-year term. The term will be extended indefinitely provided the Company hits minimal sales requirements. Any breach of the Distribution Agreement
 or an act of terminating cause
 could lead to the loss of the Company&#8217;s exclusive distribution rights
 for the respective jurisdictions which the Company operates
 which would have a material adverse effect on the business
 results of operations and financial condition.




&#160;Since we frequently enter into exclusive arrangements to market our products with unaffiliated agents
 our business and prospects depend in part on our
 and with respect to our agency or joint venture brands
 our strategic partners&#8217; ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of our brands and trademarks. Although both we and our strategic partners actively apply for registration of our brands and trademarks
 they could be imitated in ways that we cannot prevent. Also
 we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how
 concepts and formulas. Our methods of protecting this information may not be adequate. Moreover
 we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement of third parties&#8217; rights that could interfere with our use of this information. Defending these claims may be costly and
 if unsuccessful
 may prevent us from continuing to use this proprietary information in the future and result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us. We do not maintain non-competition agreements with all of our key personnel or with some of our key suppliers. If competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to our or our strategic partners&#8217; trade secrets
 proprietary know-how or recipes
 the appeal
 and thus the value
 of our brand portfolio could be reduced
 negatively impacting our sales and growth potential.


We operate in highly competitive industries
 and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;The alcoholic beverages production and distribution industries in our region are intensely competitive. The principal competitive factors in these industries include product range
 pricing
 distribution capabilities and responsiveness to consumer preferences
 with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the market and the product. The alcoholic beverage industry competes with respect to brand recognition
 product quality
 brand loyalty
 customer service and price. Failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects for business. Wholesaler
 retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by
 among other things
 the perceived absolute or relative overall value of our products
 including their quality or pricing
 compared to competitor&#8217;s products. Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing
 purchasing
 financing
 operational
 advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers
 state and provincial agencies
 and retailers which could affect their supply of
 or consumer demand for
 our products. We could also experience higher than expected selling
 general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.



&#160;While over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets
 there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the U.S. and other markets in which we participate. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors
 including:























A general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments
 such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws related to driving while under the influence of alcohol;






Consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter
 lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks
 sports drinks and water products;













Increased federal
 state
 provincial or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing; and































&#160;Our business of marketing and distributing alcoholic beverages in the United States is subject to regulation by national and local governmental agencies. These regulations and laws address such matters as licensing and permit requirements
 regarding the production
 storage and import of alcoholic products; competition and anti-trust matters; trade and pricing practices; taxes; distribution methods and relationships; required labeling and packaging; advertising; sales promotion; and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Loss of production capacity due to regulatory issues can negatively affect our sales and increase our operating costs as we attempt to increase production at other facilities during that time to offset the lost production. It is possible that we could have similar issues in the future that will adversely impact our sales and operating costs. Additionally
 new or revised regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes
 customs duties
 income taxes
 or sales taxes could materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;In addition
 we are subject to numerous environmental and occupational
 health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we plan to operate. We may incur significant costs to maintain compliance with evolving environmental and occupational
 health and safety requirements
 to comply with more stringent enforcement of existing applicable requirements or to defend against challenges or investigations
 even those without merit. Future legal or regulatory challenges to the industry in which we operate or our business practices and arrangements could give rise to liability and fines
 or cause us to change our practices or arrangements
 which could have a material adverse effect on us
 our revenues and our profitability.

&#160;Governmental regulation and supervision as well as future changes in laws
 regulations or government policy (or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations) that affect us
 our competitors or our industry generally
 strongly influence our viability and how we operate our business. Complying with existing laws
 regulations and government policy is burdensome
 and future changes may increase our operational and administrative expenses and limit our revenues.

&#160;Additionally
 governmental regulatory and tax authorities have a high degree of discretion and may at times exercise this discretion in a manner contrary to law or established practice. Such conduct can be more prevalent in jurisdictions with less developed or evolving regulatory systems like Mexico. Our business would be materially and adversely affected if there were any adverse changes in relevant laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement. Our ability to introduce new products may also be affected if we cannot predict how existing or future laws
 regulations or policies would apply to such products or services.


If we fail to manage growth effectively or prepare for product scalability
 it could have an adverse effect on our employee efficiency
 product quality
 working capital levels and results of operations

&#160;Any significant growth in the market for our products or our entry into new markets may require an expansion of our employee base for managerial
 operational
 financial
 and other purposes. As of March 31
 2014
 we had no full time employees outside of our management team. During any period of growth
 we may face problems related to our operational and financial systems and controls
 including quality control and delivery and service capacities. We would also need to continue to expand
 train and manage our employee base. Continued future growth will impose significant added responsibilities upon the members of management to identify
 recruit
 maintain
 integrate
 and motivate new employees.

&#160;Aside from increased difficulties in the management of human resources
 we may also encounter working capital issues
 as we will need increased liquidity to finance the marketing of the products we sell
 and the hiring of additional employees. For effective growth management
 we will be required to continue improving our operations
 management
 and financial systems and controls. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational and financial inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers.






















&#160;If our management team is unable to execute on its business strategies
 then our development
 including the establishment of revenues and our sales and marketing activities would be materially and adversely affected. In addition
 we may encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting
 forecasting and other process control issues presented by any future growth. We may seek to augment or replace members of our management team or we may lose key members of our management team
 and we may not be able to attract new management talent with sufficient skill and experience.


If we are unable to retain key executives and other key affiliates
 our growth could be significantly inhibited and our business harmed with a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;Our success is
 to a certain extent
 attributable to the management
 sales and marketing
 and operational and technical expertise of certain key personnel. Alex Viecco
 our Chief Executive Officer
 Carlos Gonzalez Rivera
 our Chief Operating Officer
 and Sergio Gonzalez Rivera
 our President
 perform key functions in the operation of our business. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect upon our business
 financial condition
 and results of operations. We do not maintain key-person insurance for members of our management team because it is cost prohibitive at this point. If we lose the services of any member of senior management
 we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements
 and may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel
 which could severely disrupt our business and prospects.

Our success in the future may depend on our ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances
 and any failure on our part to establish and maintain such relationships would adversely affect our market penetration and revenue growth.

&#160;Due to the regulated nature of the alcoholic beverage industry
 we will be required to establish strategic relationships with third parties. Our ability to establish strategic relationships will depend on a number of factors
 many of which are outside our control
 such as the competitive position of our product and marketing plan relative to our competitors. We may not be able to establish other strategic relationships in the future. In addition
 any strategic alliances that we establish may subject us to a number of risks
 including risks associated with sharing proprietary information
 loss of control of operations that are material to developed business and profit-sharing arrangements. Moreover
 strategic alliances may be expensive to implement and subject us to the risk that the third party will not perform its obligations under the relationship
 which may subject us to losses over which we have no control or expensive termination arrangements. As a result
 even if our strategic alliances with third parties are successful
 our business may be adversely affected by a number of factors that are outside of our control.


Our financial results may not meet the expectations of investors and may fluctuate because of many factors and
 as a result
 investors should not rely on our revenue and/or financial projections as indicative of future results.

&#160;Fluctuations in operating results or the failure of operating results to meet the expectations of investors may negatively impact the value of our securities. Operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors that could affect revenues or expenses in any particular quarter. Fluctuations in operating results could cause the value of our securities to decline. Investors should not rely on revenue or financial projections or comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance. As a result of the factors listed below
 it is possible that in future periods results of operations may be below the expectations of investors. This could cause the market price of our securities to decline. Factors that may affect our quarterly results include:




























































Because our auditors have issued a going concern opinion
 there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

&#160;Our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended March 31
 2014 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding
 our business
 prospects
 financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern
 we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited consolidated financial statements
 and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment.


Our strategy may include acquiring companies which may result in unsuitable acquisitions or failure to successfully integrate acquired companies
 which could lead to reduced profitability.

&#160;We may embark on a growth strategy through acquisitions of companies or operations that complement existing product lines
 customers or other capabilities. We may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates
 or may be unable to consummate desired acquisitions. To the extent any future acquisitions are completed
 we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or their operations
 or if integration is more difficult than anticipated
 we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on future profitability. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate
 or realize any anticipated benefits from
 acquisitions include:
















difficulties integrating the acquired company&#8217;s standards
 processes
 procedures and controls;




















difficulties increasing the scope
 geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;






difficulties consolidating facilities
 transferring processes and know-how;




























Demand for our products may be adversely affected by many factors
 including changes in consumer preferences and

&#160;Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic and social trends
 public health initiatives
 product innovations
 changes in vacation or leisure activity patterns and a downturn in economic conditions
 which may reduce consumers&#8217; willingness to purchase distilled spirits or cause a shift in consumer preferences toward beer
 wine or non-alcoholic beverages. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations.






















&#160;We compete on the basis of product taste and quality
 brand image
 price
 service and ability to innovate in response to consumer preferences. The global spirits industry is highly competitive and is dominated by several large
 well-funded international companies which trend toward consolidation. It is possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or effectively or resort to price competition to sustain market share
 which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. The dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by our inability to maintain or increase prices
 changes in geographic or product mix
 a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesalers
 retailers or consumers to purchase competitor&#8217;s products instead of our products. Wholesaler
 retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by
 among other things
 the perceived absolute or relative overall value of our products
 including their quality or pricing
 compared to competitor&#8217;s products. Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing
 purchasing
 financing
 operational
 advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers
 state and provincial agencies
 and retailers which could affect their supply of
 or consumer demand for
 our products. We could also experience higher than expected selling
 general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.




&#160;Anti-alcohol groups have
 in the past
 advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements
 higher taxes and other regulations designed to discourage alcohol consumption. More restrictive regulations
 negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could
 in turn
 significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue growth
 causing a decline in our results of operations.




&#160;The alcoholic beverage industry faces the possibility of class action or similar litigation alleging that the continued excessive use or abuse of beverage alcohol has caused death or serious health problems. It is also possible that governments could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government funded health care costs. Litigation or assertions of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry
 and it is possible that we
 as well as our suppliers
 could be named in litigation of this type.

&#160;Also
 lawsuits have been brought in a number of states alleging that beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted underage consumers in their advertising. Plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants&#8217; advertisements
 marketing and promotions violate the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in each of these states and seek repayment of the family funds expended by the underage consumers. While we have not been named in these lawsuits
 we could be named in similar lawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend against
 depleting our cash and diverting our personnel resources and
 if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail
 our business could be harmed significantly.


Regulatory decisions and legal
 regulatory and tax changes could limit our business activities
 increase our operating costs and reduce our margins.

&#160;The production
 distribution
 marketing
 advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive regulation in all of the countries in which we operate. We are required to comply with these regulations and to maintain various permits and licenses. We are also required to conduct business only with holders of licenses to import
 warehouse
 transport
 distribute and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other governmental regulations applicable to our industry will not change or become more stringent. Moreover
 because these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation
 we may not be able to predict when and to what extent liability may arise. Additionally
 due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related societal problems
 including driving while intoxicated
 underage drinking
 alcoholism and health consequences from the abuse of alcohol
 various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions or limits on advertising or other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current or future regulations and requirements relating to our industry and products could result in monetary penalties
 suspension or even revocation of our licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm our business
 as we could find it necessary to raise our prices in order to maintain profit margins
 which could lower the demand for our products and reduce our sales and profit potential.



















&#160;Further
 the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation both in the U.S. and internationally (and
 in the U.S.
 at both the federal and state government levels)
 and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import and excise duties in most countries around the world. An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly harm our sales revenue and margins
 both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol.




&#160;Although we maintain liability insurance and will attempt to limit contractually our liability for damages arising from our products
 these measures may not be sufficient for us to successfully avoid or limit liability. Our product liability insurance coverage is limited to $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate and our general liability umbrella policy is capped at $1 million. Further
 any contractual indemnification and insurance coverage we have from parties supplying our products is limited
 as a practical matter
 to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by these suppliers. In any event
 extensive product liability claims could be costly to defend and/or costly to resolve and could harm our reputation.


If we become subject to product liability claims
 personal injury claims or defective products
 our business may be harmed.

&#160;The marketing and sale of our products entails risk of product liability and there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be asserted against us. While we intend to obtain some business liability insurance
 insurance designed to cover product liability is expensive
 difficult to obtain in some cases and may not be available now or in the future on acceptable terms
 if at all. Furthermore
 there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be adequate
 or that a product liability claim
 even one without merit
 would not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. As a result
 any imposition of product liability could materially harm our business
 financial condition and results of operations. In addition
 we do not have any business interruption insurance due to the limited coverage of any such business interruption insurance
 and as a result
 any business disruption or natural disaster could severely disrupt our business and operations and significantly decrease our revenue and profitability.


Contamination of our products and/or counterfeit or confusingly similar products could harm the image and integrity of
 or decrease customer support for
 our brands and decrease our sales.

&#160;The success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of them. Contamination
 whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action
 or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands
 could affect the demand for our products. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our products or defects in the distillation and fermentation processes could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among
 or injury to
 consumers of our products and could result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands. Also
 to the extent that third parties sell products that are either counterfeit versions of our brands or brands that look like our brands
 consumers of our brands could confuse our products with products that they consider inferior. This could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our sales and operations.






&#160;Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol &#8220;TQLA.&#8221; The liquidity of our Common Stock may be very limited and affected by our limited trading market. The OTCQB market is an inter-dealer market much less regulated than the major exchanges
 and is subject to abuses
 volatilities and shorting. There is currently no broadly followed and established trading market for our Common Stock. An established trading market may never develop or be maintained. Active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders. Absence of an active trading market reduces the liquidity of the shares traded.



















&#160;The trading volume of our Common Stock may be limited and sporadic. This situation is attributable to a number of factors
 including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts
 stock brokers
 institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume
 and that even if we came to the attention of such persons
 they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence
 there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent
 as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our Common Stock will develop or be sustained
 or that current trading levels will be sustained. As a result of such trading activity
 the quoted price for our Common Stock on the OTCQB may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of our fair market value. In addition
 if our shares of Common Stock cease to be quoted
 holders would find it more difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotation as to the market value of
 our Common Stock and as a result
 the market value of our Common Stock likely would decline.

&#160;The market price for our stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations in response to factors
 including the following:










































announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions
 strategic partnerships
 joint ventures or capital commitments;






general technological
 market or economic trends;







































&#160;Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock
 regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our Common Stock will be at any time
 including as to whether our Common Stock will sustain current market prices
 or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of Common Stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.




&#160;We anticipate seeking the listing of our Common Stock on a national or other securities exchange at some time in the future
 assuming that we can satisfy the initial listing standards for such exchange. We currently do not satisfy the initial listing standards and cannot ensure that we will be able to satisfy such listing standards or that our Common Stock will be accepted for listing on any such exchange. Should we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of such exchanges
 or our Common Stock is otherwise rejected for listing
 the trading price of our common stock could suffer
 the trading market for our Common Stock may be less liquid
 and our Common Stock price may be subject to increased volatility.






















&#160;A prolonged decline in the price of our Common Stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our Common Stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. A decline in the price of our Common Stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and our operations. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations
 including our ability to develop new services and continue our current operations. If our Common Stock price declines
 we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future
 we may not be able to have the resources to continue our normal operations.









&#160;A substantial majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) (&#8220;Rule 144&#8221;). As restricted shares
 these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that a non-affiliate who has held restricted securities for a period of at least six months may sell their shares of Common Stock. Under Rule 144
 affiliates who have held restricted securities for a period of at least six months may
 under certain conditions
 sell every three months
 in brokerage transactions
 a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of a company&#8217;s outstanding shares of Common Stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale (the four calendar week rule does not apply to companies quoted on the OTCQB). A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Securities Act
 if available
 or pursuant to subsequent registrations of our shares of Common Stock
 may have a depressive effect upon the price of our shares of Common Stock in any active market that may develop.

If we issue additional shares or derivative securities in the future
 it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.

&#160;Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 300
000
000 shares of Common Stock
 $0.001 par value per share. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares
 or derivative securities to purchase some or all of such shares
 to provide additional financing in the future.




&#160;We have not declared any dividends in the past
 and we do not intend to distribute dividends in the near future. The declaration
 payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon
 among other things
 the results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition
 operating and capital requirements
 and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid
 and if dividends are paid
 there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.




&#160;As a public company
 we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)
 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;). These requirements are extensive. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual
 quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting.



















&#160;We may incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and costs associated with applicable corporate governance requirements. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. This may divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result
 it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules
 and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.


If we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls
 we may not be able to report our financial results accurately. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our business and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

&#160;We are required to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures and to comply with other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC. Our management will need to include a report on our internal control over financial reporting and its assessment on whether such internal controls were effective for the prior fiscal year with our annual reports that we file under the Exchange Act with the SEC. Under current federal securities laws
 our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.

&#160;Our management has limited or no experience operating as a public reporting company under the Exchange Act or establishing the level of internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our management currently relies in many instances on the professional experience and advice of third parties including our attorneys and accountants. At present
 we have started reviewing and instituting internal controls
 but it may take time to implement them fully as a newly public reporting company under the Exchange Act.

&#160;Our management cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all possible errors. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and subject to simple error or mistake. Furthermore
 controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more persons
 or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time
 a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system
 misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.


If we do not file our quarterly or annual reports with the SEC
 we may be de-listed from the OTCQB.

&#160;OTCQB is the middle tier of the OTC market. OTCQB companies report to the SEC or a U.S. banking regulator
 making it easy for investors to identify companies that are current in their reporting obligations. There are no financial or qualitative standards to be in this tier. OTCQB securities may also be quoted on the FINRA BB. The OTCQB allows investors to easily identify reporting companies traded in the OTC market regardless of where they are quoted.

&#160;Under OTCQB rules relating to the timely filing of periodic reports with the SEC
 any OTCQB issuer who fails to file a periodic report (Forms 10-Q or 10-K) by the due date of such report may be removed from the OTCQB. If we do not file our quarterly or annual reports with the SEC
 we may be de-listed from the OTCQB and our Common Stock may only be able to be traded on the OTC Pink. The OTC Pink is the bottom tier of the OTC market &#8211; a speculative trading marketplace that helps broker-dealers get the best prices for investors. Accordingly
 our securities may become worthless and we may be forced to curtail or abandon our business plan.




















Persons associated with securities offerings
 including consultants
 may be deemed to be broker dealers.

&#160;In the event that any of our securities are offered without engaging a registered broker-dealer
 we may face claims for rescission and other remedies. If any claims or actions were to be brought against us relating to our lack of compliance with the broker-dealer requirements
 we could be subject to penalties
 required to pay fines
 make damages payments or settlement payments
 or repurchase such securities. In addition
 any claims or actions could force us to expend significant financial resources to defend our company
 could divert the attention of our management from our core business and could harm our reputation.









&#160;Trading in our Common Stock is subject to the &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer that recommends our Common Stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors
 must
 prior to the sale
 make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&#8217;s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available
 the regulations require the delivery
 prior to any transaction involving a penny stock
 of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition
 broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our Common Stock
 which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our Common Stock.










&#160;We rent our executive office on a month to month basis for $625 per month.&#160;&#160;We currently have no policy with respect to investments or interests in real estate
 real estate mortgages or securities of
 or interests in
 persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.






























&#160;Our Common Stock was initially traded on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol ACSR and was first quoted on October 18
 2011.&#160;&#160;From February 28
 2013
 our Common Stock has been quoted on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol TQLA. The table below sets forth the high and low prices for our Common Stock for the quarters included within the past two fiscal years. Quotations reflect inter-dealer prices
 without retail mark-up
 mark-down commission
 and may not represent actual transactions. Since our Common Stock trades sporadically
 there is not an established active public market for its Common Stock. No assurance can be given that an active market will exist for our Common Stock and we do not expect to declare dividends in the foreseeable future since we intend to utilize our earnings
 if any
 to finance our future growth
 including possible acquisitions.

&#160;Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to vote at a meeting of Company&#8217;s stockholders. Holders of Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Stockholders do not have any preemptive rights or other similar rights to acquire additional shares of Common Stock or other securities. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any then-outstanding preferred stock

CASA Montalvo Holdings
 Inc.

&#160;CASA Montalvo Holdings
 Inc. (&#8220;Casa Montalvo&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on April 4
 2011. Casa Montalvo develops markets and/or distributes alcoholic beverages
 primarily in the United States.



&#160;On August 9
 2012
 the Company formed Montalvo Imports LLC (&#8220;LLC&#8221; or &#8220;Imports&#8221;) under the laws of the State of Delaware. &#160;The LLC
 of which the Company is the sole member
 was formed to provide the same services as that of the Company.

Formation of Cannabis Beverage Group
 Inc.

&#160;On March 27
 2014
 the Company formed Cannabis Beverage Group
 Inc. (&#8220;CBG&#8221;) under the laws of the State of Colorado.&#160;&#160;CBG
 of which the Company is the sole&#160;shareholder
 was formed to explore entry into the cannabis based beverage industry.



&#160;On December 21
 2012
 the Company
 entered into and consummated the Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;) with Casa Montalvo and the shareholders of Casa Montalvo (the &#8220;Exchange&#8221;). Upon consummation of the transactions set forth in the Agreement (the &#8220;Closing&#8221;)
 the Registrant adopted the business plan of Casa Montalvo.




















&#160;Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement
 the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Casa Montalvo in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate for 59
000
016 post-split (pre-split 1
817
891) shares of the Registrant&#8217;s Common Stock
 par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Exchange Shares&#8221;). As a result of the Exchange
 Casa Montalvo became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant. The shareholders of Casa Montalvo beneficially owned approximately eighty-eight and one half percent (88.5%) of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Registrant immediately after the consummation of the Exchange. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement
 the Registrant&#8217;s principal shareholder agreed to retire 10
000
000 shares of the Registrant&#8217;s Common Stock.

&#160;As a result of the controlling financial interest of the former stockholder of Casa Montalvo
 for financial statement reporting purposes
 the merger between the Company and Casa Montalvo has been treated as a reverse acquisition with Casa Montalvo deemed the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed the accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with section 805-10-55 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.&#160;&#160;The reverse acquisition is deemed a capital transaction and the net assets of Casa Montalvo (the accounting acquirer) are carried forward to the Company (the legal acquirer and the reporting entity) at their carrying value before the acquisition.&#160;&#160;The acquisition process utilizes the capital structure of the Company and the assets and liabilities of Casa Montalvo which are recorded at their historical cost.&#160;&#160;The equity of the Company is the historical equity of Casa Montalvo retroactively restated to reflect the number of shares issued by the Company in the transaction.




&#160;While our primary route to market is by selling directly to distributors
 who maintain extensive resources to sell to both on and off premise retail accounts
 including liquor stores
 grocery stores
 convenience stores
 bars and restaurants
 to build our brands
 we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: the distributors; the retail trade; and the end consumer. We believe advertising
 marketing and promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image and perception of our brand as we strive in building substantial brand value.

&#160;We employ
 in-house marketing
 sales and customer service personnel who work together with third party design and advertising firms to maintain a high degree of focus on each of our products. We attempt to build brand awareness through innovative marketing activities including social media
 brand tastings
 as well as competitive spirits competitions. We use a variety of marketing strategies and tactics to build brand equity and increase sales
 including consumer and trade advertising
 price promotions
 point-of-sale materials
 event sponsorship
 in-store and on-premise promotions and public relations
 as well as a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques. Our significant public relations campaign has helped gain editorial coverage for our brands
 which increases brand awareness. Past and future event sponsorship is an economical way for us to have influential consumers taste our brands.




&#160;We develop
 market and/or distribute alcoholic beverages
 primarily in the United States. We sell our products through a network of established spirits distributors
 who are licensed to distribute alcoholic beverages throughout the United States. The We are federally licensed
 maintaining the right to sell to distributors in all markets in the U.S. and globally.

&#160;We intend to focus on growing the market share of our initial products
 the ultra-premium Montalvo line of tequilas
 whose expressions include Plata
 Reposado
 Anejo and Extra-Anejo. We own the Montalvo brand trademark and have exclusive worldwide master distribution rights to the brands.

&#160;We intend to grow our business by expanding our portfolio of premium alcoholic beverage brands
 including additional spirits categories
 as well as beer and wine
 through additional importation and distribution contracts of existing brands. In addition
 we may choose to develop new brands or acquire existing companies with their own brand portfolios.



















&#160;To achieve our goal of building a distinctive portfolio of premium craft spirits
 we seek to:









grow revenues by securing additional independent distributors for Montalvo Tequila in multiple states in the U.S. and potentially in additional countries internationally and by targeted marketing activities. We anticipate such marketing activities will require us to expend approximately $750
000. As the independent distributors are generally large
 well-recognized companies
 we feel that accounts receivable financing should be available
 though it may not be on favorable terms. We anticipate that increased sales revenues from Montalvo Tequila will contribute to improving our cash flow and provide additional liquidity from operations. We may require additional financing through private placements or issuance of notes payable
 and there is no assurance that such financing will be available. In the event we are not able to increase our working capital
 we will not be able to implement or may be required to delay all or part of our business plan
 and our ability to attain profitable operations
 generate positive cash flows from operating and investing activities and materially expand the business will be materially adversely affected.












explore the potential of developing or acquiring new or existing brands by identifying attractive acquisition candidates
 entering into negotiations and reaching agreements with these candidates and obtaining financing to acquire such brands. We estimate we will expend $15
000 to identify brands that are potential acquisition targets and $25
000 discussing and negotiating acquisition terms and drafting preliminary agreements; the funding required to acquire a potential target is too speculative to estimate. We intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of third party financing and
 in appropriate circumstances
 the further issuance of equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position
 and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results. Also
 the pursuit of acquisitions and other new business relationships may require significant management attention. We may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates
 obtain financing on favorable terms or complete these types of transactions in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us
 if at all.








&#160;Based on the our cash balance at March 31
 2014 and projected cash needs for the remainder of 2014
&#160;management estimates that&#160;it will need to raise additional capital to cover operating and capital requirements for the 2014 year.&#160;Management plans on raising the additional needed funds through increased sales volume
 issuing additional shares of common stock or other equity securities
 or obtaining debt financing. Although we have been successful to date in raising necessary funding
 there can be no assurance that required future financing can be successfully completed on a timely basis
 or on terms acceptable to us.




&#160;We have an Exclusive Worldwide Distribution Agreement with Destilidora Huerta Real
 S.A. de C.V.
 the producers of Montalvo Tequila. Montalvo
 an award winning
 ultra-premium tequila brand is a handcrafted
 meticulously formulated tequila produced from only the highest quality blue agave plants from the Lowlands of Jalisco
 Mexico. Montalvo ensures the brand&#8217;s premium quality by handcrafting in small batches
 using hand-selected Blue Weber agave plants picked at the peak of maturity and employing a third distillation. Fourth-generation tequila producers Sergio and Carlos Gonzalez Rivera have combined their family&#8217;s ancient traditions with modern techniques
 resulting in a clean
 smooth and memorable tequila. Montalvo is available in four expressions: Plata
 Reposado
 A&#241;ejo and Extra-A&#241;ejo.




&#160;The U.S. alcoholic beverage industry is a regulated
 three-tier system of suppliers
 distributors and retailers. We currently distribute the Montalvo Tequila brand through a network of independent distributors. We also maintain an arrangement with MHW
 Ltd.
 a third-party leading service provider to alcoholic beverage companies
 to import the Montalvo brand into the U.S. as well as to sell Montalvo directly to retailers in New York
 New Jersey and California. We hope to expand the number of independent distributors in certain existing markets and new markets
 when we have sufficient funds to maintain a larger marketing campaign.























Year ended March 31
 2014 compared to year ended March 31
 2013

 For the year ended March 31
 2014
 net sales were approximately $119
900 compared to $28
800 in net sales for the year ended March 31
 2013
 an increase of 316%. The increase was a result of the our increased marketing efforts and the signing of additional distribution arrangements in Florida and Arizona.

&#160;&#160;Gross margin for the year ended March 31
 2014 was $80
971
 or 67.5% of net sales compared to $16
785 gross margin
 or approximately 58.2% of net sales for the year ended March 31
 2013
 which represents an increase of approximately 380%.&#160;&#160;This increase in gross margin is attributable to our increased marketing and distribution efforts for Montalvo Tequila described above. We were also able to maintain&#160;&#160;margins due to the implementation of our premium product selling strategy implemented that targets premium price points
 targeted non-price discounting promotion for our products and low overhead.

&#160;Selling
Selling
 general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31
 2014 amounted to approximately $819
600 compared to approximately $1
637
000 for the same period of the prior year
 a decrease of&#160;approximately $817
400.&#160;&#160;The decrease was primarily attributable to a one time $1
461
101 stock based compensation expense the Company recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31
 2013
 based on shares of Casa Montalvo Holdings
 Inc. that were issued immediately prior to the Share Exchange.

Interest expense for the year ended March 31
 2014 was approximately $4
680 compared to $4
159 for the same period last year
 a net increase of $521 or 12.5%.&#160;&#160;This increase is predominantly due to the issuance of additional promissory notes as compared to prior year.

 The above resulted in a net loss before income tax of $1
044
815 for the year ended March 31
 2014 compared to a net loss before income tax of 1
624
327 for the year ended March 31
 2013.



&#160;Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern.&#160;As of March 31
 2014
 we had a shareholders' equity deficit of approximately $622
982 compared with a deficit of approximately $328
932 at March 31
 2013
&#160;and has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows since inception. For the year ended March 31
 2014
 we sustained a net loss before income tax of $1
044
815 compared to a net loss before income tax of $1
624
327 for the year ended March 31
 2013 and used cash of approximately $215
738 in operating activities for the year ended March 31
 2014 compared with approximately&#160;$95
028 for the year ended March 31
 2013.&#160;&#160;The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence.



&#160;&#160;Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31
 2014 was approximately $215
738
 primarily from our loss of approximately $1
044
815 net with non cash activities of $829
077 including an increase in accrued liabilities of $267
389 and $257
375 in stock based compensation.&#160;&#160;Changes in operating assets
 liabilities and sundry and other non cash activities were $216
317.

&#160;Net cash&#160;provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31
 2014 was approximately $212
590 primarily from sale of common stock of $175
640 and a net issuance of notes payable of $11
900.






















The Company had an accumulated deficit at March 31
 2014
Further
 the Company has inadequate working capital to maintain or develop its operations
 and is dependent upon funds from private investors and the support of certain stockholders.






&#160;As of March 31
 2014
 there were no off balance sheet arrangements.












&#160;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published
 and (iii) the reported amount of net sales and expenses recognized during the periods presented. Adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved information not previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly
 actual results could differ from these estimates. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues
 costs and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




 
&#8221; which is when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (2) delivery of products and services has occurred
 (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.




&#160;The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At March 31
 2014
 cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash in the bank.




&#160;Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using principally the straight-line method. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of
 income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value and proceeds realized. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred
 and replacements and betterments are capitalized.

















































&#160;At March 31
 2014
 property and equipment consisted of office equipment purchased during the period.




&#160;Long-Lived Assets
 such as property
 plant
 and equipment and purchased intangibles
 are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Any goodwill or other intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows
 an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were no events or changes in circumstances that necessitated an impairment of long lived assets as of March 31
 2014.






&#160;ASC Topic 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not
 that the position will be sustained on audit
 including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes
 if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount
 which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating the Company's tax positions and tax benefits
 which may require periodic adjustments. At March 31
 2014
 the Company did not record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions.




&#160;The Company maintains its operating cash balances in banks located in California. The Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) insures accounts at each institution up to $100
000.&#160;&#160;At March 31
 2014
 the Company&#8217;s cash accounts were below the insured limit.




&#160;Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options
 warrants
 and other commitments to issue Common Stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of Common Stock that could share in the earnings of the Company. The Company does not have any options
 warrants or other Common Stock equivalents outstanding as of March 31
 2014.






















&#160;The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash
 accounts payable
 accrued liabilities
 and advances from affiliates. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows.

&#160;ASC Topic 820
 &#8221; (&#8220;ASC Topic 820&#8221;) defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition of fair value that focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes
 within the measurement of fair value
 the use of market-based information over entity specific information and establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.














Level 2 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 or inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities other than quoted prices
 either directly or indirectly
 including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active;











&#160;We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements during the year ended March 31
 2014.



&#160;In April 2014
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08
 Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property
 Plant
 and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. The amendments in this Update change the requirements for reporting discontinued operations in Subtopic 205-20.


&#160;Under the new guidance
 a discontinued operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and &#8220;represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity&#8217;s operations and financial results.&#8221; The ASU states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of (i) a major geographical area of operations
 (ii) a major line of business
 (iii) a major equity method investment
 or (iv) other major parts of an entity. Although &#8220;major&#8221; is not defined
 the standard provides examples of when a disposal qualifies as a discontinued operation.


&#160;The ASU also requires additional disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide more information about the assets
 liabilities
 income and expenses of discontinued operations. In addition
 the ASU requires disclosure of the pre-tax profit or loss attributable to a disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements.


&#160;The ASU is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning on or after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods within those years.


&#160;In June 2014
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10
 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation.




















&#160;The amendments in this Update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification
 thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition
 the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income
 cash flows
 and shareholder equity
 (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity
 (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
 and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage.


&#160;The amendments also clarify that the guidance in Topic 275
 Risks and Uncertainties
 is applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations.


&#160;Finally
 the amendments remove paragraph 810-10-15-16. Paragraph 810-10-15-16 states that a development stage entity does not meet the condition in paragraph 810-10-15-14(a) to be a variable interest entity if (1) the entity can demonstrate that the equity invested in the legal entity is sufficient to permit it to finance the activities that it is currently engaged in and (2) the entity&#8217;s governing documents and contractual arrangements allow additional equity investments.


&#160;The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage.


&#160;The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public business entities
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods therein.


&#160;Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity&#8217;s financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption
 entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915.


&#160;Management does not believe that any recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncements
 if adopted
 would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.







































&#160;In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)


 with the participation of the Company&#8217;s principal executive officer&#160;&#160;and principal financial officer
 the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are defined as those controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports it files or submits under the Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the Commission&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures
which are identified below.&#160;&#160;It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
 regardless of how remote.













The Company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management
 we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions.














. The Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert
 and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process.





&#160;We intend to initiate measures to remediate the identified material weaknesses including
 but not necessarily limited to
 the following:









Establishing a formal review process of significant accounting transactions that includes participation of the Chief Executive Officer
 the Chief Financial Officer and the Company&#8217;s corporate legal counsel.







Forming an Audit Committee that will establish policies and procedures that will provide the Board of Directors a formal review process that will among other things
 assure that management controls and procedures are in place and being maintained consistently.

























&#160;Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintain records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition 
 use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected.


&#160;As of March 31
 2014
 management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on this evaluation under the COSO Framework
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting are not effective as of March 31
 2014. In making this assessment
 our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation
 they concluded that
 as of March 31
 2014
 such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.


&#160;The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company&#8217;s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company's Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of March 31
 2014 and communicated to our management.


&#160;The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company&#8217;s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company's Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of March 31
 2014 and communicated to our management.


&#160;Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2)
 (3) and (4) above did not have an affect on the Company's financial results. However
 management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Company's determination to its financial statements for the future years.


&#160;We are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment
 we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.




















&#160;Management believes that the appointment of more outside directors
 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
 will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's Board. In addition
 management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further
 management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future.


&#160;We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements
 as necessary and as funds allow.





&#160;There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31
 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.

&#160;We do not
 at present
 have any employees other than the current directors and officers.


























&#160;During the past ten years
 none of our current directors or executive officers has been:

































subject to any order
 judgment or decree
 not subsequently reversed
 suspended or vacated
 of any court of competent jurisdiction
 permanently or temporarily enjoining
 barring
 suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business
 securities or banking activities;












found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action)
 the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law
 that has not been reversed
 suspended
 or vacated;












subject of
 or a party to
 any order
 judgment
 decree or finding
 not subsequently reversed
 suspended or vacated
 relating to an alleged violation of a federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation
 law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies
 law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or










subject of
 or a party to
 any sanction or order
 not subsequently reversed
 suspended or vacated
 of any self-regulatory organization
 any registered entity or any equivalent exchange
 association
 entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.




&#160;None of our directors
 officers or affiliates
 or any beneficial owner of 5% or more of our common stock
 or any associate of such persons
 is an adverse party in any material proceeding to
 or has a material interest adverse to
 us or any of our subsidiaries.



&#160;Our Board of Directors has not established a separate audit committee within the meaning of Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Instead the board of directors acts as the audit committee within the meaning of Section 3(a)(58)(B) of the Exchange Act.&#160;We intend on establishing an Audit Committee composed of independent directors of the Company. The audit committee's duties would be to recommend to the Company's board of directors the engagement of independent auditors to audit the Company's financial statements and to review its accounting and auditing principles. The audit committee would review the scope
 timing and fees for the annual audit and the results of audit examinations performed by the internal auditors and independent public accountants
 including their recommendations to improve the system of accounting and internal controls. The audit committee would at all times be composed exclusively of directors who are
 in the opinion of the Company's board of directors
 free from any relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a committee member and who possess an understanding of financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles.





&#160;Our board of directors does not have a separate compensation committee responsible for determining executive and director compensation.&#160;&#160;Instead
 the board of directors fulfills this function
 and each member of the Board participates in the determination.&#160;&#160;Given the small size of the Company and its Board
 plus the Company's limited resources
 locating
 obtaining and retaining additional independent directors is extremely difficult.&#160;&#160;In the absence of independent directors
 the Board does not believe that creating a separate compensation committee would result in any improvement in the compensation determination process.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the board of directors has concluded that the Company and its stockholders would be best served by having the entire board of director&#8217;s act in place of a compensation committee.&#160;&#160;When acting in this capacity
 the Board does not have a charter.
























&#160;We have adopted a code of ethics meeting the requirements of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We believe our code of ethics is reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and promote honest and ethical conduct; provide full
 fair
 accurate
 timely and understandable disclosure in public reports; comply with applicable laws; ensure prompt internal reporting of violations; and provide accountability for adherence to the provisions of the code of ethic.&#160;&#160;A copy of our code of ethics is available without charge

 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of March 31
 2014 and 2013
 and the related statements of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company had an accumulated deficit at March 31
 2014
 a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year then ended.&#160;&#160;These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;Management&#8217;s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application.&#160;&#160;Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results and require management&#8217;s most difficult
 subjective
 or complex judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company&#8217;s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.

















of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to determine whether and how to consolidate another entity.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned subsidiaries&#8212;all entities in which a parent has a controlling financial interest&#8212;shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest with the parent
 the majority owner; (2) if the parent is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely to be temporary; (3) consolidation by an investment company within the scope of Topic 946 of a non-investment-company investee.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8 the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest
 and
 therefore
 as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation.&#160;&#160;The power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership
 for example
 by contract
 lease
 agreement with other stockholders
 or by court decree. The Company consolidates all less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries
 in which the parent&#8217;s power to control exists.

The consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company as of March 31
 2014 and 2013.










































Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business











Management assumes that the realization of the Company&#8217;s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carry&#8211;forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly
 the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses
 (b) general economic conditions
 and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering
 among other factors.





These significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions
 and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.


Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.


Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information
 changes in facts and circumstances
 historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations
 if deemed appropriate
 those estimates are adjusted accordingly.








The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#8221;) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.&#160;&#160;Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.&#160;&#160;The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.&#160;&#160;The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below:


















Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.


























Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.


The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.&#160;&#160;If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.


The carrying amounts of the Company&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities
 such as cash
 accounts receivable
 prepaid expenses
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities
 approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.


The Company&#8217;s note payable approximates the fair value of such instrument based upon management&#8217;s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at March 31
 2014 and 2013.



Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis
 as the requisite conditions of competitive
 free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties
 if made
 shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.





The Company&#8217;s non-financial assets include inventories.&#160;&#160;The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventories by evaluating turn rates
 inventory levels and other factors.&#160;&#160;Excess quantities are identified through evaluation of inventory aging
 review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences. The Company provides lower of cost or market reserves for such identified excess and slow-moving inventories. The Company establishes a reserve for inventory shrinkage
 if any
 based on the historical results of physical inventory cycle counts.











Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
 net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160;&#160;The Company follows paragraph 310-10-50-9 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160;&#160;The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer&#8217;s current credit worthiness
 as determined by the review of their current credit information; and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical write-off experience
 customer specific facts and economic conditions.





Outstanding account balances are reviewed individually for collectability.&#160;&#160;The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company&#8217;s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company&#8217;s existing accounts receivable. Bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses
 if any.











We record inventory on the first-in
 first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) method. In accordance with generally recognized trade practice
 maturing spirits inventories are classified as current assets
 although the majority of these inventories ordinarily will not be sold within one year
 due to the duration of aging processes. Maturing spirits inventory includes costs of production such as warehousing and insurance. Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market value for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products
 the impact of new product introductions
 inventory turns
 product spoilage and specific identification of items
 such as product discontinuance
 material changes
 or regulatory-related changes.




















The Company evaluates its current level of inventory considering historical sales and other factors and
 based on this evaluation
 classify inventory markdowns in the income statement as a component of cost of goods sold pursuant to Paragraph 420-10-S99 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to adjust inventory to net realizable value. These markdowns are estimates
 which could vary significantly from actual requirements if future economic conditions
 customer demand or competition differ from expectations.


There was no inventory obsolescence for the reporting period ended March 31
 2014 or 2013.


There was no lower of cost or market adjustments for the reporting period ended March 31
 2014 or 2013.







Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties include a)&#160;affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required
 absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825&#8211;10&#8211;15
 to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c)&#160;trusts for the benefit of employees
 such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e)&#160;management of the Company; f)&#160;other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g.&#160; other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.


The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions
 other than compensation arrangements
 expense allowances
 and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However
 disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include:&#160;&#160;a)&#160;the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions
 including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed
 for each of the periods for which income statements are presented
 and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c)&#160;the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d)&#160;aamounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and
 if not otherwise apparent
 the terms and manner of settlement.





The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued
 which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings
 the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
















If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated
 then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.&#160;&#160;If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible
 or is probable but cannot be estimated
 then the nature of the contingent liability
 and an estimate of the range of possible losses
 if determinable and material
 would be disclosed.


Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees
 in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.&#160;&#160;Management does not believe
 based upon information available at this time
 that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position
 results of operations or cash flows. However
 there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business
 financial position
 and results of operations or cash flows.





The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition.&#160;&#160;The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.&#160;&#160;The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer
 (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable
 and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.




The Company accounts for shipping and handling fees in accordance with paragraph 605-45-45-19 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.&#160; While amounts charged to customers for shipping products are included in revenues
 the related costs are classified in cost of goods sold as incurred.






The Company accounts for its stock based compensation in which the Company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions under the recognition and measurement principles of the fair value recognition provisions of section 718-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-30-6 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
 all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued
Pursuant to ASC Section 505-50-30, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.&#160;&#160;The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur. If shares of the Company are thinly traded the use of share prices established in the Company&#8217;s most recent private placement memorandum (PPM&#8221;)
 or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.

























Expected volatility of the entity&#8217;s shares and the method used to estimate it.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(ii) a thinly-traded or nonpublic entity that uses the calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the expected volatility of its share price
 the appropriate industry sector index that it has selected
 the reasons for selecting that particular index
 and how it has calculated historical volatility using that index.&#160;&#160;The Company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility.&#160;&#160;If shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.














































Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-25-7
 if fully vested
 non-forfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments)
 then
 because of the elimination of any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments
 a measurement date has been reached. A grantor shall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued (in most cases
 when the agreement is entered into). Whether the corresponding cost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset (or whether the debit should be characterized as contra-equity under the requirements of paragraph 505-50-45-1) depends on the specific facts and circumstances. Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-45-1
 a grantor may conclude that an asset (other than a note or a receivable) has been received in return for fully vested
 non-forfeitable equity instruments that are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (and no specific performance is required by the grantee in order to retain those equity instruments). Such an asset shall not be displayed as contra-equity by the grantor of the equity instruments. The transferability (or lack thereof) of the equity instruments shall not affect the balance sheet display of the asset. This guidance is limited to transactions in which equity instruments are transferred to other than employees in exchange for goods or services. Section 505-50-30 provides guidance on the determination of the measurement date for transactions that are within the scope of this Subtopic.


Pursuant to Paragraphs 505-50-25-8 and 505-50-25-9
 an entity may grant fully vested
 non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable by the grantee only after a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee achieves specified performance conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and in the same manner as if the entity had paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of paying with
 or using
 the equity instruments. A recognized asset
 expense
 or sales discount shall not be reversed if a stock option that the counterparty has the right to exercise expires unexercised.


Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-30-S99-1
 if the Company receives a right to receive future services in exchange for unvested
 forfeitable equity instruments
 those equity instruments are treated as unissued for accounting purposes until the future services are received (that is
 the instruments are not considered issued until they vest). Consequently
 there would be no recognition at the measurement date and no entry should be recorded.





The Company adopted the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Paragraph 740-10-25-13.addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.&#160;&#160;Under paragraph 740-10-25-13
 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position.&#160;&#160;The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.&#160;&#160;Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.&#160;&#160;The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13.


The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
 as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.


















Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition
 the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management&#8217;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.





The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to unrecognized income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the provisions of Section 740-10-25&#160;for the reporting period ended March 31
 2014 or 2013.





Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.&#160;&#160;&#160;Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.&#160;&#160;Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement
 stock options or warrants.


There were no potentially outstanding dilutive shares for the reporting period ended March 31
 2014 or 2013.





The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting
 classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating
 investing
 or financing activities and provides definitions of each category
 and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (&#8220;Indirect method&#8221;) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.&#160;&#160;The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows
 using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.





The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the&#160;financial statements were issued.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
 the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users
 such as through filing them on EDGAR.





In April 2014
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08
 Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property
 Plant
 and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. The amendments in this Update change the requirements for reporting discontinued operations in Subtopic 205-20.


Under the new guidance
 a discontinued operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and &#8220;represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity&#8217;s operations and financial results.&#8221; The ASU states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of (i) a major geographical area of operations
 (ii) a major line of business
 (iii) a major equity method investment
 or (iv) other major parts of an entity. Although &#8220;major&#8221; is not defined
 the standard provides examples of when a disposal qualifies as a discontinued operation.


















The ASU also requires additional disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide more information about the assets
 liabilities
 income and expenses of discontinued operations. In addition
 the ASU requires disclosure of the pre-tax profit or loss attributable to a disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements.


The ASU is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning on or after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods within those years.


In June 2014
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10
 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation.


The amendments in this Update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification
 thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition
 the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income
 cash flows
 and shareholder equity
 (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity
 (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
 and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage.


The amendments also clarify that the guidance in Topic 275
 Risks and Uncertainties
 is applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations.


Finally
 the amendments remove paragraph 810-10-15-16. Paragraph 810-10-15-16 states that a development stage entity does not meet the condition in paragraph 810-10-15-14(a) to be a variable interest entity if (1) the entity can demonstrate that the equity invested in the legal entity is sufficient to permit it to finance the activities that it is currently engaged in and (2) the entity&#8217;s governing documents and contractual arrangements allow additional equity investments.


The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage.


The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public business entities
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods therein.


Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity&#8217;s financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption
 entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915.


Management does not believe that any recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncements
 if adopted
 would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.





The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.


As reflected in the consolidated financial statements
 the Company had an accumulated deficit at March 31
 2014
 a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.


















The Company is attempting to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue; however
 the Company&#8217;s cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company&#8217;s daily operations.&#160;&#160;While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering
 there can be no assurances to that effect.&#160;&#160;The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company&#8217;s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.

000 of Company Common Stock (subject to certain limitations) from time to time over a twenty-four (24) month period. Also on August 29
 2013
 Montalvo entered into a Registration Rights Agreement
 (the &#8220;Registration Rights Agreement&#8221;)
 with Lincoln Park
 in which Montalvo filed with the SEC the registration statement to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended
 or the Securities Act
 the shares that have been or may be issued to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.


Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement
 the Company has the right to sell to and LPC is obligated to purchase up to $10
050
000 in shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock
 subject to certain limitations
 from time to time
 over the 24 month period commencing on November 7

 which the Company agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) pursuant to the Lincoln Park Registration Rights Agreement
 was declared effective by the SEC. The Company may
 from time to time and at its&#8217; sole discretion
 direct Lincoln Park to purchase shares of Company common stock in amounts up to 100
000 shares on any single business day so long as at least one business day has passed since the most recent purchase or up to $500
000 per purchase plus an additional &#8220;accelerated amount&#8221; under certain circumstances.&#160;&#160;There are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Purchase Agreement
 and Montalvo will control the timing and amount of any sales of Common Stock to Lincoln Park. The purchase price of the shares that may be sold to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will be based on the market price of our Common Stock immediately preceding the time of sale as computed under the Purchase Agreement without any fixed discount; provided that in no event will such shares be sold to Lincoln Park when the closing sale price is less than $0.25 per share
 subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share will be equitably adjusted for any reorganization
 recapitalization
 non-cash dividend
 stock split
 or other similar transaction occurring during the business days used to compute such price. The Company may at any time in its sole discretion terminate the Purchase Agreement without fee
 penalty or cost upon one business day notice.&#160;&#160;Lincoln Park may not assign or transfer its rights and obligations under the Purchase Agreement.


In connection with the entry into the Purchase Agreement the Company issued 603

At March 31
 2014
 the Company had net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carry&#8211;forwards for Federal income tax purposes of $2
799
212 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2034. No tax benefit has been reported with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards because the Company believes that the realization of the Company&#8217;s net deferred tax assets of approximately $951
732 was not considered more likely than not and accordingly
 the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance.


Deferred tax&#160;assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards.&#160;&#160;The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding its realization.&#160;&#160;The valuation allowance increased approximately $399
461 and $552
271 for the Fiscal Year ended March 31
 2014 and 2013
 respectively.

&#13;and
 therefore
 as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent of the outstanding&#13;voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The power to control may also exist with&#13;a lesser percentage of ownership

 maturing spirits inventories are&#13;classified as current assets
 although the majority of these inventories ordinarily will not be sold within one&amp;#160;year
 due&#13;to the duration of aging processes. Maturing spirits inventory includes costs of production such as warehousing and insurance.&#13;Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market value for obsolete or slow moving inventory&#13;based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products

 which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when&#13;one or more future events occur or fail to occur.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment&#13;inherently involves an exercise of judgment.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending&#13;against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings

 then the estimated&#13;liability would be accrued in the Company&amp;#146;s consolidated financial statements.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;If the assessment indicates that&#13;a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible

&#13;if fully vested
 non-forfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for&#13;goods or services (no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments)
 then
 because of the&#13;elimination of any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments
 a measurement date has been reached.&#13;A grantor shall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued (in most cases
 when the agreement is entered into). Whether&#13;the corresponding cost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset (or whether the debit should be characterized as contra-equity&#13;under the requirements of paragraph 505-50-45-1) depends on the specific facts and circumstances. Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-45-1
&#13;a grantor may conclude that an asset (other than a note or a receivable) has been received in return for fully vested

 an entity may grant fully vested
 non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable by the grantee only after&#13;a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee achieves specified performance&#13;conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and in the same manner as if the entity&#13;had paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of paying with
 or using
 the equity instruments.&#13;A recognized asset
 expense

&#13;if the Company receives a right to receive future services in exchange for unvested
 forfeitable equity instruments
 those equity&#13;instruments are treated as unissued for accounting purposes until the future services are received (that is
 the instruments are&#13;not considered issued until they vest). Consequently


 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than&#13;not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has&#13;a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also&#13;provides guidance on de-recognition

 a discontinued&#13;operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale&#13;and &amp;#147;represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity&amp;#146;s operations and financial results.&amp;#148;&#13;The ASU states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of (i) a major geographical area of operations
 (ii) a major line&#13;of business
 (iii) a major equity method investment

 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment&#13;to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810

 thereby removing&#13;the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition
&#13;the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements&#13;of income
 cash flows
 and shareholder equity
 (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity
 (3) disclose&#13;a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged

The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify&#13;U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided&#13;to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination&#13;of the exception may change the consolidation analysis

 2012
 the Company formed&#13;Montalvo Imports LLC (&amp;#147;LLC&amp;#148; or &amp;#147;Imports&amp;#148;) under the laws of the State of Delaware. &amp;#160;The LLC
 of which&#13;the Company is the sole member


 2014
 the Company formed Cannabis Beverage Group

 2012
 the Company

Upon consummation of the transactions set forth in the Exchange Agreement&#13;(the &amp;#147;Closing&amp;#148;)

&#13;the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Casa Montalvo in exchange for the issuance of&#13;an aggregate for 59

&#13;and
 therefore
 as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent of the outstanding&#13;voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The power to control may also exist with&#13;a lesser percentage of ownership

 or by court decree. The Company&#13;consolidates all less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries

 the potential tax benefits&#13;of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company&#13;has incurred recurring losses

 maturing spirits inventories are&#13;classified as current assets
 although the majority of these inventories ordinarily will not be sold within one year
 due to the&#13;duration of aging processes. Maturing spirits inventory includes costs of production such as warehousing and insurance.

 which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when&#13;one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment inherently&#13;involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company&#13;or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings

 then the estimated&#13;liability would be accrued in the Company&amp;#146;s consolidated financial statements.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;If the assessment indicates that&#13;a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible

 all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration&#13;received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the&#13;fair value of the equity instrument issued

 all&#13;transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for&#13;based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued

&#13;if fully vested
 non-forfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for&#13;goods or services (no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments)
 then
 because of the&#13;elimination of any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments
 a measurement date has been reached.&#13;A grantor shall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued (in most cases
 when the agreement is entered into). Whether&#13;the corresponding cost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset (or whether the debit should be characterized as contra-equity&#13;under the requirements of paragraph 505-50-45-1) depends on the specific facts and circumstances. Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-45-1
&#13;a grantor may conclude that an asset (other than a note or a receivable) has been received in return for fully vested

 an entity may grant fully vested
 non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable by the grantee only after&#13;a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee achieves specified performance&#13;conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and in the same manner as if the entity&#13;had paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of paying with
 or using
 the equity instruments.&#13;A recognized asset
 expense

&#13;if the Company receives a right to receive future services in exchange for unvested
 forfeitable equity instruments
 those equity&#13;instruments are treated as unissued for accounting purposes until the future services are received (that is
 the instruments are&#13;not considered issued until they vest). Consequently

 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than&#13;not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has&#13;a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also&#13;provides guidance on de-recognition

 a discontinued&#13;operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale&#13;and &amp;#147;represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity&amp;#146;s operations and financial results.&amp;#148;&#13;The ASU states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of (i) a major geographical area of operations
 (ii) a major line&#13;of business
 (iii) a major equity method investment

 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment&#13;to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810

&#13;the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements&#13;of income
 cash flows
 and shareholder equity
 (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity
 (3) disclose&#13;a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged

The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify&#13;U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided&#13;to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities.

Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of
accounting policies and their application.&#160;&#160;Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important
to the portrayal of the Company&#146;s financial condition and results and require management&#146;s most difficult
 subjective
or complex judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company&#146;s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.

another entity.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned subsidiaries&#151;all entities in which a
parent has a controlling financial interest&#151;shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest with the parent
the majority owner; (2) if the parent is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely to be temporary; (3)
consolidation by an investment company within the scope of Topic 946 of a non-investment-company investee.&#160;&#160;Pursuant
to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8 the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest
and
 therefore
 as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent of the outstanding
voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation.&#160;&#160;The power to control may also exist with
a lesser percentage of ownership
 for example
 by contract
 lease
 agreement with other stockholders
 or by court decree. The Company
consolidates all less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries
 in which the parent&#146;s power to control exists.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions
and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions


in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reporting amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate
on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company&#146;s critical accounting estimate(s) and assumption(s)
affecting the financial statements were:


: Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.


: Management assumes that the realization of the Company&#146;s net deferred
tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carry&#150;forwards for Federal income tax purposes that
may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly
 the potential tax benefits
of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company
has incurred recurring losses
 (b) general economic conditions
 and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily
operations by way of a public or private offering
 among other factors.


or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions
and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.


experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole
under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.

 if deemed appropriate
 those estimates are adjusted accordingly.

820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to measure the fair value of
its financial instruments.&#160;&#160;Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework
for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.&#160;&#160;The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.&#160;&#160;The
three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described
below:



    
    
    

    
    
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.

one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

inputs.&#160;&#160;If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described
above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

 net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160;&#160;The Company follows paragraph 310-10-50-9 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160;&#160;The Company performs on-going credit
evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer&#146;s current credit worthiness
as determined by the review of their current credit information; and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical
write-off experience

of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date
the consolidated financial statements are issued
 which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when
one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment inherently
involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company
or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings
 the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or
unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

or realizable and earned.&#160;&#160;The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following
criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been
rendered to the customer
 (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable
 and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.

Stock-Based Compensation for Obtaining
Employee Services


compensation in which the Company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions under the recognition and measurement
principles of the fair value recognition provisions of section 718-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant
to paragraph 718-10-30-6 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
 all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration
received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the
fair value of the equity instrument issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable.&#160;&#160;The measurement date used to determine
the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which
it is probable that performance will occur.&#160;&#160;If shares of the Company are thinly traded the use of share prices established
in the Company&#146;s most recent private placement memorandum (&#34;PPM&#148;)
 or weekly or monthly price observations would
generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger
spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.

of assumptions for inputs are as follows:



    
Expected term of share options and similar instruments: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the expected term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the instruments and employees&#146; expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the instruments.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1

 if (i) A company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time its equity shares have been publicly traded; (ii) A company significantly changes the terms of its share option grants or the types of employees that receive share option grants such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term; or (iii) A company has or expects to have significant structural changes in its business such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options and similar instruments as the company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.

issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under guidance of Sub-topic 505-50 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (&#147;Sub-topic 505-50&#148;).


 all
transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for
based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued
 whichever is more reliably
measurable.&#160;&#160;The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of
the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur. If shares of the
Company are thinly traded the use of share prices established in the Company&#146;s most recent private placement memorandum (&#34;PPM&#148;)
or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares
could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.

if fully vested
 non-forfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for
goods or services (no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments)
 then
 because of the
elimination of any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments
 a measurement date has been reached.
A grantor shall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued (in most cases
 when the agreement is entered into). Whether
the corresponding cost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset (or whether the debit should be characterized as contra-equity
under the requirements of paragraph 505-50-45-1) depends on the specific facts and circumstances. Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-45-1
a grantor may conclude that an asset (other than a note or a receivable) has been received in return for fully vested
 non-forfeitable
equity instruments that are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (and no specific
performance is required by the grantee in order to retain those equity instruments). Such an asset shall not be displayed as contra-equity
by the grantor of the equity instruments. The transferability (or lack thereof) of the equity instruments shall not affect the
balance sheet display of the asset. This guidance is limited to transactions in which equity instruments are transferred to other
than employees in exchange for goods or services. Section 505-50-30 provides guidance on the determination of the measurement date
for transactions that are within the scope of this Subtopic.


505-50-25-9
 an entity may grant fully vested
 non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable by the grantee only after
a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee achieves specified performance
conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and in the same manner as if the entity
had paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of paying with
 or using
 the equity instruments.
A recognized asset
 expense
 or sales discount shall not be reversed if a stock option that the counterparty has the right to exercise
expires unexercised.


if the Company receives a right to receive future services in exchange for unvested
 forfeitable equity instruments
 those equity
instruments are treated as unissued for accounting purposes until the future services are received (that is
 the instruments are
not considered issued until they vest). Consequently
 there would be no recognition at the measurement date and no entry should
be recorded.




paragraph 740-10-25-13 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Paragraph 740-10-25-13.addresses the determination of whether
tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.&#160;&#160;Under
paragraph 740-10-25-13
 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than
not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position.&#160;&#160;The
tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has
a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.&#160;&#160;Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also
provides guidance on de-recognition

Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. The amendments in this Update change the requirements for reporting
discontinued operations in Subtopic 205-20.


 a discontinued
operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale
and &#147;represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity&#146;s operations and financial results.&#148;
The ASU states that a strategic shift could include a disposal of (i) a major geographical area of operations
 (ii) a major line
of business
 (iii) a major equity method investment
 or (iv) other major parts of an entity. Although &#147;major&#148; is not
defined
 the standard provides examples of when a disposal qualifies as a discontinued operation.

 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment
to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation.


the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification
 thereby removing
the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition
the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements
of income
 cash flows
 and shareholder equity
 (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity
 (3) disclose
a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
 and (4) disclose in the first year in which the
entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage.


guidance in Topic 275
 Risks and Uncertainties
 is applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations.


 the amendments remove paragraph
810-10-15-16. Paragraph 810-10-15-16 states that a development stage entity does not meet the condition in paragraph 810-10-15-14(a)
to be a variable interest entity if (1) the entity can demonstrate that the equity invested in the legal entity is sufficient to
permit it to finance the activities that it is currently engaged in and (2) the entity&#146;s governing documents and contractual
arrangements allow additional equity investments.


an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable
interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify
U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided
to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination
of the exception may change the consolidation analysis

that has an interest in an entity in the development stage.
