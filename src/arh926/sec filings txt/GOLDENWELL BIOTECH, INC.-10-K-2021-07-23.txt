ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY
To qualify for quotation on the OTC Markets
 an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer
 known as the market maker
 willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company listing. We do not yet have an agreement with a registered broker-dealer
 as the market maker
 willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the Company listing. If the Company meets the qualifications for trading securities on the OTC Markets our securities will trade on the OTC Markets until a future time

We have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. There are no restrictions in our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes
 however
 prohibit us from declaring dividends where
our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of stockholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution
There are no unreported sales of equity securities at December 31
The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define &#8220;penny stock&#8221; to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our Common Stock
 when and if a trading market develops
 may fall within the definition of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1.00 million
 or annual incomes exceeding $200
000 individually
 or $300
000
For transactions covered by these rules
 the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser&#8217;s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally
 for any transaction
 other than exempt transactions
 involving a penny stock
 the rules require the delivery
 prior to the transaction
 of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative
 current quotations for the securities and
 if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker
 the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer&#8217;s presumed control over the market. Finally
 monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently
We did not purchase any of our shares of common stock or other securities during the year ended December 31
As a &#8220;smaller reporting company
&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 1

To date the Company has little operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. No revenues are anticipated until we complete the financing we endeavor to obtain
 as described in this Form 10-K
 and implement our initial business plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
Our activities have been financed from the proceeds of share subscriptions. On August 20
 2019 the Company sold 41
000
000 shares of common stock to its founders for a subscription amount of $41

GOLDENWELL BIOTECH INC. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 20
 2019. The Company is in the development stage whose purpose is R&amp;D
&#8221; The Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts to the development of its business plans. The Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10
In accordance with ASC 720
 &#8220;
Cash includes cash in banks
 money market funds
 and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception
 which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
 in the opinion of management
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740
 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes&#8221;. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31
 2020
December 31
The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&#8221;
 which&nbsp;defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements
The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments
 including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis
ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. &nbsp;The Company has not generated any revenues since inception and sustained an accumulated net loss of $6
324 for the year ended on December 31
 2020. These factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#8217;s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon
 among other things
The reconciliation of income tax benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 21% for the year ended December 31
(1
1
December 31
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company&#8217;s net deferred tax assets as of December 31
1
(1
The Company has approximately $8
635 of net operating losses (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carried forward to offset taxable income
 if any
 in future years which expire commencing in fiscal 2037. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment
The Company has authorized 300
000
000 common shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share.&nbsp; Each common share entitles the holder to one vote
 in person or proxy
On August 20
 2019 the Company issued 41
000
000 shares of common stock to its founders for a subscription amount of $41
000. As of December 31

On August 20
 2019
 the Company issued 39
000
000 shares of common stock for a subscription amount of $209
204. As of December 31
 2019
 $207
904 of the subscription has been paid with the remaining $7
600 of the subscription has not yet been paid
On December 1
 2020
 the Company issued 11
500
000 shares of common stock for a subscription amount of $79
000. As of December 31
 2020
 $1

000 of the subscription has not yet been paid
Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued. On January 11th

 the company issued 2
400

Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
 as appropriate
Our management
 including our President and our Secretary
 carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2020. Based on this evaluation
 our management concluded that as of December 31
 2020 these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level. As discussed below
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process
 including policies and procedures
Our President
 who acts as both our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
Based on the results of this assessment
 our management
 including our President and our Secretary
 concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31
 2020
 based on such criteria. Deficiencies existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i) lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and (ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Management believes that the lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures
In connection with our continued monitoring and maintenance of our controls procedures as part of the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 we continue to review
 test
 and improve the effectiveness of our internal controls. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter and since the year ended December 31
 2020 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations
 including the exercise of judgment in designing
 implementing
 operating
 and evaluating the controls and procedures
 and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly
 any system of internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable
 not absolute
 assurances. In addition
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

We believe that our directors should have the highest professional and personal ethics and values
 consistent with our values and standards. They should have broad experience at the policy-making level in business or banking. They should be committed to enhancing stockholder value and should have sufficient time to carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on experience. Their service on other boards of public companies should be limited to a number that permits them
 given their individual circumstances
 to perform responsibly all director duties for us. Each director must represent the interests of all stockholders. When considering potential director candidates
 the Board also considers the candidate&#8217;s character
 judgment
 diversity
 age and skills
Our board of directors is currently composed of three members
 none of whom qualifies as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests
 such as that the director is not
 and has not been for at least three years
 one of our employees and that neither the director
 nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition
 our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which
 in the opinion of our board of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director
 though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations

As of December 31
 2020
Since we do not have an audit
 compensation or governance and nominating committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early stage company and has only one director
 and to date
 such director has been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our sole director and officer has the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
There are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above
We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless
 every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors
 as applicable
 and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications
 and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year
The Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officers
 principal financial officer
 principal accounting officer or controller
We have no indemnification agreements with our officers

635 of net operating losses (&amp;#8220;NOL&amp;#8221;) carried forward to offset taxable income

 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities

 in the opinion of management
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740
 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes&#8221;. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
 which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. &nbsp;The Company has not generated any revenues since inception and sustained an accumulated net loss of $6
324 for the year ended on December 31
 2020. These factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#8217;s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon
 among other things
 its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes

 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

(1
The Company has approximately $8
635 of net operating losses (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carried forward to offset taxable income
 if any
 in future years which expire commencing in fiscal 2037. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment
 management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
