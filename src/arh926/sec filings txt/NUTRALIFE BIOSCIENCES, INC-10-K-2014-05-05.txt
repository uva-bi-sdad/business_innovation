 Alpine Distributors and Core-Mark Holding Company
 Inc. who resell the product purchase to retail locations. Alpine Distributors and Core-Mark purchase products from us on an as needed basis. They order our products by delivering a purchase order to us. &nbsp;Upon our acceptance of an order
 we generate an invoice reflecting the quantity of product ordered and the amount due for the order. &nbsp;We ship the order with the invoice. &nbsp;We require payment from Alpine and Core-Mark within 30 days after delivery of the product. &nbsp;&nbsp;We have a written agreement with Core-Mark that requires them to pay for all product ordered within 30 days of delivery. &nbsp;&nbsp;We have no written agreement with Alpine setting forth terms of payment for product purchased. &nbsp;We verbally agreed with Alpine that payment is due upon 30 days after delivery and we provide Alpine with an invoice with each delivery of our product reflecting payment is due within 30 days of delivery. 


 2013
 we received approximately 23%
 36% and 14% of our revenues from Core-Mark Holding Company
 AMS Healthy and Alpine Distributors
 respectively. As a result
 our revenues are highly concentrated in these three customers. Core-Mark Holding Company
 AMS Healthy and Alpine Distributors are not obligated to purchase a minimum amount of products from us. Should any of these distributors decrease or cease ordering products from us
 our revenues and results of operations will be negatively affected. &nbsp;&nbsp;

 we believe that we maintain better control over product quality and availability while also reducing production costs.


 we retain the services of outside GMP audit firms to assist in our efforts to comply with GMPs.&nbsp; In 2013
 we used the services of ASI Food Safety Consultants
 Inc.

 we are unable to obtain any of our raw materials from our suppliers
 we believe that we could obtain alternative sources of any raw materials from other suppliers
 We do not have contracts with our suppliers and we order our raw materials on an as-needed basis. We have not experienced any material adverse effect on our business as a result of shortages of raw materials or packaging materials used in the manufacturing of our products. An unexpected interruption or a shortage in supply of raw materials could adversely affect our business derived from these products.
















 minerals
 dietary supplements
 herbs
 botanicals and compounds derived therefrom. Numerous manufacturers and distributors compete with us for customers throughout the United States in the packaged nutritional supplement industry selling products to retailers such as mass merchandisers
 drug store chains

 it is unlike that such materials are likely to result in the violation of any existing environmental rules and/or regulations. Further
 we do not own any real property that could lead to liability as a landowner. Therefore
 we do not anticipate that there will be any material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

000. Product liability claims may result in significant legal costs related to our defense of such actions if the amounts exceed our product liability insurance coverage. The design
 development
 and manufacture of products for human consumption involves an inherent risk of product liability claims and corresponding damage to our brand name reputation
 including claims of product failure or harm caused by our products. As such
 any product liability claim could negatively affect our business.




 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 advertising
 distribution and sale (hereafter
 &quot;sale&quot; or &quot;sold&quot; may be used to signify all of these activities) of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies
 principally the Food and Drug Administration (&quot;FDA&quot;) and the Federal Trade Commission (&quot;FTC&quot;)
 and to a lesser extent the Consumer Product Safety Commission (&quot;CPSC&quot;)
 the United States Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold
 as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States in which our products are sold. Among other matters
 regulation by the FDA and FTC is concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product's ability to provide health-related benefits. Specifically
 the FDA
 under the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act (&quot;FDCA&quot;)
 regulates the formulation
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 distribution and sale of food
 including dietary supplements
 and over-the-counter drugs. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products. The National Advertising Division (&quot;NAD&quot;) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus oversees an industry-sponsored
 self-regulatory system that permits competitors to resolve disputes over advertising claims. The NAD has no enforcement authority of its own
 but may refer matters that appear to violate the Federal Trade Commission Act or the FDCA to the FTC or the FDA for further action
 as appropriate. 


 primarily the FDA and the FTC
 have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them
 including initiating investigations
 issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders
 requiring corrective labeling or advertising
 requiring consumer redress (for example
 requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold to consumers)
 seeking injunctive relief or product seizures
 imposing civil penalties
 or commencing criminal prosecution. In addition
 certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food
 dietary supplement and over-the-counter drug industries
 including the imposition of civil penalties in the millions of dollars against a few industry participants. 


 amending the FDCA. We believe DSHEA is generally favorable to consumers and to the dietary supplement industry. DSHEA establishes a statutory class of &quot;dietary supplements
&quot; which includes vitamins
 minerals
 herbs
 amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet. Dietary ingredients marketed in the United States before October 15
 1994 may be marketed without the submission of a &quot;new dietary ingredient&quot; (&quot;NDI&quot;) premarket notification to the FDA. Dietary ingredients not marketed in the United States before October 15
 1994 may require the submission
 at least 75 days before marketing
 of an NDI notification containing information establishing that the






 DSHEA prevents the FDA from regulating dietary ingredients in dietary supplements as &quot;food additives&quot; and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on product labels and in labeling. The FDA has issued final regulations under DSHEA and has issued draft guidance on NDI notification requirements. Further guidance and regulations are expected. Several bills to amend DSHEA in ways that would make this law less favorable to consumers and industry have been proposed in Congress. 


 we may need to revise our product labeling. Most of our products are classified as dietary supplements. 


 2007. The GMPs cover manufacturers and holders of finished dietary supplement products
 including dietary supplement products manufactured outside the United States that are imported for sale into the United States. Among other things
 the new GMPs: (a) require identity testing on all incoming dietary ingredients
 (b) call for a &quot;scientifically valid system&quot; for ensuring finished products meet all specifications
 (c) include requirements related to process controls
 including statistical sampling of finished batches for testing and requirements for written procedures and (d) require extensive recordkeeping.


 there can be no assurance that our operations or those of our suppliers will be in compliance in all respects at all times. Additionally
 there is a potential risk of increased audits as the FDA and other regulators seek to ensure compliance with the GMP&#146;s.


 2006
 Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act
 which went into effect on December 22
 2007. The law requires
 among other things
 that companies that manufacture or distribute nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements report serious adverse events allegedly associated with their products to the FDA and institute recordkeeping requirements for all adverse events (serious and non-serious). There is a risk that consumers
 the press and government regulators could misinterpret reported serious adverse events as evidence of causation by the ingredient or product complained of
 which could lead to additional regulations
 banned ingredients or products
 increased insurance costs and a potential increase in product liability litigation
 among other things. 


 the CPSIA requires testing and certification of certain products and enhances the CPSC's authority to order recalls. 


 enacted January 4
 2011
 amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA's authority over various aspects of food regulation. The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines there is a reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of
 or exposure to
 the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Other changes include the FDA's expanded access to records; the authority to suspend food facility registrations and require high risk imported food to be accompanied by a certification; stronger authority to administratively detain food; the authority to refuse admission of an imported food if it is from a foreign establishment to which a U.S. inspector is refused entry for an inspection; and the requirement that importers verify that the foods they import meet domestic standards. 


 except dietary supplement facilities in compliance with both GMPs and the serious adverse event reporting requirements. Although dietary supplement facilities are exempt from the HARBPC requirements
 dietary ingredient facilities might not qualify for the exemption. The HARBPC requirements
 which the FDA has yet to propose
 are expected to be onerous because facilities will have to develop and implement preventive controls to assure that identified hazards are significantly minimized or prevented
 monitor the effectiveness of the preventive controls and maintain numerous records related to the HARBPC. The HARBPC requirements may increase the costs of dietary ingredients and/or affect our ability to obtain dietary ingredients. 






 the FDA published in July 2011 a draft guidance document clarifying when the FDA believes a dietary ingredient is an NDI
 when a manufacturer or distributor must submit an NDI premarket notification to the FDA
 the evidence necessary to document the safety of an NDI and the methods for establishing the identity of an NDI. The draft guidance
 if implemented as proposed
 could have a material impact on our operations. Although our industry has strongly objected to several aspects of the draft guidance
 it is unclear whether the FDA will make changes to the final guidance. In addition
 it is possible that the FDA will begin taking enforcement actions consistent with the interpretations in the draft guidance before issuing a final version. 


 as well as the FDA enforcement of the NDI guidance as written
 could require us to incur additional expenses
 which could be significant
 and negatively impact our business in several ways
 including
 but not limited to
 the detention and refusal of admission of imported products
 the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that such ingredients or products are in compliance and the potential imposition of fees for re-inspection of noncompliant facilities. Each of these events would increase our liability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows. 


 and have also coordinated enforcement against dietary supplement claims in other areas
 including children's products. Their efforts to date have focused on manufacturers and marketers as well as media outlets
 and have resulted in a significant number of investigations and enforcement actions
 some resulting in civil penalties of several million dollars under the Federal Trade Commission Act. We expect that the FTC and the FDA will continue to focus on health-related claims for dietary supplements and foods
 and our products could be the subject of an FTC/FDA inquiry.

 we have no policy with respect to investments in securities of or interests in persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.




 we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings
 which arise
 in the ordinary course of business. However
 litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties
 and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition or operating results.

 therefore
 will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she desire to do so when eligible for public resales. Furthermore
 it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans unless a regular trading market develops.




 as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Thus
 our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock.


 a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the sale
 unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt. 


 under the penny stock regulations
 the broker-dealer is required to:






 prior to any transaction involving a penny stock
 a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market
 unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;












 the account's value
 and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and






 prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer's account.


 broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock
 which may affect the ability of our shareholders or to sell their shares in the secondary market
 and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities
 if our securities become publicly traded. In addition
 the liquidity for our securities may be decreased
 with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will
 in all likelihood
 find it difficult to sell their securities.

 Inc. is the producer of nutritional supplements that uses micro molecular formulae and a utilization of an oral spray to provide faster and more efficient absorption.


 Inc was founded as NutraFuels

 and although not profitable
 the Company has progressively added the needed equipment to expand its operations to meet the demand of consumption on a national level.

 purchasing necessary equipment
 and other application development to expand sales and marketing. Many of our investments have increased our costs on an absolute basis in the near-term. Many of these investments had and will continue to occur in advance of experiencing any immediate near term benefit. We expect that our research
 sales and marketing costs will continue to increase as a percentage of revenues in the short-term; however
 as we increase our products sales
 we will gain from the economies of scale
 thereby reducing the costs as a percentage of revenues.






 NutraFuels has used Core-Mark distribution which has placed orders
 and bulk shipments. The distribution network of Core-Mark has increased our productions and sales.


 2013
 our revenues were $597
777. &nbsp;Should we not have sufficient revenues to meet operating costs
 we will require additional capital. We have no commitments or assurances that it will ever be successful in obtaining adequate future financing. &nbsp;We have incurred net losses and losses from operations and we expect that we will continue to have negative cash flows as we implement our business plan. There can be no assurance that our continuing efforts to execute our business plan will be successful and that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. We currently do not have sufficient cash to sustain us for the next twelve months and we will require additional capital to continue as a going concern. In the event that financing does not materialize
 we may be unable to pay our obligations as they become due or continue as a going concern

 &nbsp;and the expansion &nbsp;of the distribution &nbsp;network. &nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the increase in revenues was also due to the increase in production
 at a higher cost in Selling and Administrative costs (from $312

 as well as expenditures for equipment and machinery. &nbsp;Another contributing factor was the increased in the size of the manufacturing facilities
 enabling greater production capability.; (ii) Registrant &nbsp;has experienced and expects an increasing trend in &nbsp;sales due to &nbsp;capability &nbsp;of fulfilling larger orders that will &nbsp;come from &nbsp;greater brand acceptance due to &nbsp;previous and continuing expenditures in marketing . &nbsp;Registrant does not anticipate any &nbsp;increase in base cost of &nbsp;raw materials
 &nbsp;but does expect increased labor cost in &nbsp;proportion to increase sales orders; (iii) increased sales in 2013 are attributable to &nbsp;increased volume

 &nbsp;basic products remain at the present five products

 the company &nbsp;may expand the product line from &nbsp;human &nbsp;consumption to &nbsp;some variations for animal (pet)consumption.; (iv) inflation has not affected sales; registrant anticipates perhaps lower unit sale cost with &nbsp;greater revenues and increased cash &nbsp;flow /sales ratio.

 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


 the Company has suffered losses from operations and has deficits in cash flows from operating activities

 Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated in Florida as a limited liability company on April 10
 2010 and converted to a regular corporation on December 3
 2012. &nbsp;NutraFuels is the producer of nutritional supplements that uses micro molecular formulae and a utilization of an oral spray to provide faster and more efficient absorption.




 Inc. in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments)
 which are
 in the opinion of management
 necessary to fairly present the operating results for the respective periods.





&nbsp;&#150; The Company&#146;s financial statements are prepared under the accrual method of accounting. Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 services have been rendered
 the sales price is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is reasonably assured. This occurs only when the product is ordered and subsequently shipped.



&nbsp;&#150; We establish the existence of bad debts through a review of several factors including historical collection experience
 current aging status of the customer accounts
 and financial condition of our customers.

&nbsp;&#150; Property and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs associated with repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements which extend the life
 increase the capacity or improve the efficiency of our property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 which are 7 to 13 years.

&nbsp;&#150; The Company will review the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical-cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the asset by comparing the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset
 an impairment loss is measured and recognized.


 2012 and 2013
 the firm has not had to recognize an impairment loss.





&nbsp;&#150; Costs incurred in connection with the development of new products and manufacturing methods are charged to selling
 general and administrative expenses as incurred. During the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2013
 $20
826 and $2
155
 respectively
 were expensed as research and development costs.

Prior to &nbsp;December 3
 2012
 the firm &nbsp;was structured as an &nbsp;LLC and all &nbsp;the losses were allocated to the Member. Since conversion
 the Corporation has operating losses
 which are a carry forward against any income tax liability. &nbsp;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. 

&nbsp;&#150; Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Diluted net loss per share is determined by dividing the net loss by the sum of (1) the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and (2) if not anti-dilutive
 the effect of stock awards determined utilizing the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of the outstanding awards for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012 was -0- shares.

&nbsp;&#150; We account for stock based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718 which requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. For stock-based awards granted on or after January 1
 2012 stock-based compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. &nbsp;Until such &nbsp;time as a public market exists for the shares; or until &nbsp;such &nbsp;time as a reasonable price can &nbsp;be determined
 &nbsp;the valuation &nbsp;will be determined with reference to contemporaneous sales of stock for cash or &nbsp;the value of service rendered.

&nbsp;&#150; The carrying amount of our financial instruments
 consisting of cash equivalents
 short-term investments
 account and notes receivable
 accounts and notes payable
 short-term borrowings and certain other liabilities
 approximate their fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The carrying amount of our long-term debt approximates fair value since the stated rate of interest approximates a market rate of interest.




 the Company received approximately 23%
 36% and 14% of its revenues
 respectively
 from three separate customers. &nbsp;During 2012
 approximately 68% of revenue was concentrated among three customers.

 2012
 we entered into a convertible note agreement with a third party with a principal amount of $150
000. The note was originally convertible at the most recent price we offered or sold common stock in an offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During September 2013
 the note was modified to establish a set conversion price of $0.35 per share. &nbsp;On September 12
 2013
 the lender converted the amounts outstanding into an aggregate of 428
571 common shares.


 2012
 we entered into a convertible note agreement with a third party with a principal amount of $50
000. The note bears interest at the rate of 10% and is due on November 15
 2014. &nbsp;The note was originally convertible at the most recent price we offered or sold common stock in an offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During September 2013
 the note was modified to establish a set conversion price of $1.00 per share. 


 2013
 we entered into a convertible note with a third party in the principal amount of $100
000 which bears interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The note had originally had a due date of June 1
 2014 and was convertible at the most recent price we offered or sold common in an offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On September 7
 2013
 the note was amended to allow the amounts outstanding to be converted into our common stock at the price of $1.00 per share. The note is due on June 1
 2014. As of December 31
 2013
 the note had $100
000 of principal outstanding.


 the two notes described above did not have an effective conversion feature before the modification occurred and thus derivative treatment was not determined. &nbsp;Additionally
 there was no beneficial conversion feature associated with the notes prior to their modification. &nbsp;We evaluated the modification using the criteria set forth in ASC Topic 470-50
 Debt &#150; Modifications and Extinguishments and we determined that the modification was an extinguishment because there was a substantial modification of terms. &nbsp;However
 we did not experience a gain or loss on extinguishment because the fair value of the extinguished notes was the same as the fair value of the modified notes. &nbsp;There was no beneficial conversion feature associated with either of the modified notes because the conversion price equaled or exceeded the cash sales prices of common stock ($0.35 per share) that had occurred before the modification. &nbsp;


 Derivatives and Hedging &#150; Contracts in Entity&#146;s own stock and concluded that the conversion features meet the criteria for classification in stockholders' equity. Therefore
 derivative accounting is not applicable.


 2013
 we entered into a note agreement with a third party with a principal amount of $200
000. The note bears interest at the rate of 15% per annum and is due on August 26
 2014. Under the terms of the note
 the lender received 250
000 common shares and 500
000 common stock purchase warrants. The warrants are exercisable at the price of $.75 per share at any time prior to August 26
 2015. &nbsp;

 Mr. Catania advanced $405

 2012
 the Company borrowed $135
000 under a convertible note agreement &nbsp;with Neil Catania
 vice president. Under the original terms of the note
 it was convertible at the most recent price of shares sold in an offering registered with SEC. The note bears interest at 10% and is due on November 15
 2014. &nbsp;As of December 31
 2012
 $160
000 in principal was outstanding. During September 2013
 the note was modified to establish a set conversion price of $1.00 per share. Because no registered offering of our common stock has occurred
 the notes did not have an effective conversion feature before the modification occurred and thus derivative treatment could not be determined. &nbsp;Additionally
 there was no beneficial conversion feature associated with the notes prior to their modification. &nbsp;


 Debt &#150; Modifications and Extinguishments and we determined that the modification was an extinguishment because there was a substantial modification of terms. &nbsp;However
 we did not experience a gain or loss on extinguishment because the fair value of the extinguished note was the same as the fair value of the modified note. &nbsp;There was no beneficial conversion feature associated with the modified note because the conversion price equaled or exceeded the cash sales prices of common stock ($.35 per share) that had occurred before the modification.


 2013 Mr. Catania lent the Company an additional $50
000. &nbsp;The note is convertible into common stock at a price of $1.00 per share. &nbsp;The note bears interest at 10% and is due on May 15
 2014. &nbsp;The conversion feature was not beneficial at the time of issuance because the conversion price equaled or exceeded the cash sales prices of common stock ($.35 per share) that had occurred before the modification.


 Derivatives and Hedging &#150; Contracts in Entity&#146;s own stock and concluded that the conversion features meet the criteria for classification in stockholders' equity. Therefore

 Chief Financial Officer
 Secretary
 Treasurer and Director
 of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation

 a person is deemed to be a &quot;beneficial owner&quot; of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security.

 option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person
 which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days
 by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date. Consequently
 the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property laws

 and Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees. The Board does not have an executive committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent. Our Sole Director has determined that he is not &#147;independent&#148; under the definition set forth in the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market
 Inc.
 which is the definition that the Board has chosen to use for the purposes of the determining independence
 as the OTC Bulletin Board does not provide such a definition. Therefore
 our sole director is not independent.


 we have used the definition of &#147;independence&#148; of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an &#147;independent director&#148; is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which
 in the opinion of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:




the director is
 or at any time during the past three years was
 an employee of the company;



the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120
000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions
 including
 among other things
 compensation for board or board committee service);



a family member of the director is
 or at any time during the past three years was
 an executive officer of the company;



the director or a family member of the director is a partner in
 controlling stockholder of
 or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made
 or from which the company received

 whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);



the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where
 at any time during the past three years
 any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or



the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company&#146;s outside auditor

 in reaching a decision to subscribe
 has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the Subscriber is capable of reading
 interpreting and understanding financial statements and evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities and has the net worth to undertake such risks. Subscriber has invested in the common stock or other securities of companies comparable to us that involve non-trading
 and/or thinly traded securities and penny stocks
 unregistered securities
 restricted securities and high-risk investments. The Subscriber represents that in addition to Subscriber&#146;s &nbsp;own ability to evaluate an investment in the Securities
 the Subscriber has employed the services of an investment advisor
 attorney or accountant or other advisor to read all of the documents furnished or made available by us to the Subscriber
 to evaluate the merits and risks of such an investment on its behalf

 upon the Subscriber&#146;s investment intention. &nbsp;In connection with this
 the Subscriber understands that it is the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) that the statutory basis for such exemption would not be present if the Subscriber&#146;s representation merely meant that its present intention was to hold the Securities for a short period
 such as the capital gains period of tax statutes
 for a deferred sale
 for a market rise
 assuming that a market develops
 or for any other fixed period. &nbsp;The Subscriber realizes that
 in the view of the SEC
 an investor who purchases the Securities with a present intent to resell the interest would not be purchasing for investment as required by SEC rules.

 &nbsp;Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3

 the Form of Subscription at the end hereof duly executed by Holder
 such other documents

 by certified check payable to the order of the Company or by wire transfer to its account
 in the amount obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Stock for which this Warrant is then being exercised by the Exercise Price then in effect.

















 &nbsp;Holder hereby acknowledges that neither this Warrant nor any of the securities that may be acquired upon exercise of this Warrant have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended
 or under the securities laws of any state. Holder acknowledges that
 upon exercise of this Warrant
 the securities to be issued upon such exercise may become subject to applicable federal and state securities (or other) laws requiring registration
 qualification or approval of governmental authorities before such securities may be validly issued or delivered upon notice of such exercise. &nbsp;With respect to any such securities
 this Warrant may not be exercised by
 and securities shall not be issued to
 Holder in any state in which such exercise would be unlawful. &nbsp;Holder agrees that the Company may place such legend or legends on certificates representing securities issued upon exercise of this Warrant as the Company may reasonably deem necessary to comply with applicable state and federal securities laws for the issuance of such securities.


 &nbsp;By acceptance of this Warrant as set forth below
 Holder represents and warrants to the Company that Holder is acquiring this Warrant
 and will acquire any shares of Stock issued upon exercise of this Warrant
 for Holder&#146;s own account and for investment and without any present intention of selling or otherwise disposing of this Warrant or any such shares of Stock.


 &nbsp;This Warrant is not transferable by Holder without the express prior written consent of the Company
 which consent may be withheld at the Company&#146;s sole discretion unless Holder establishes to the Company&#146;s satisfaction that the transfer is in compliance with all federal and state securities laws and that the transferee will be bound by the terms of this Warrant and the Company&#146;s Shareholders Agreement of even date.





&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Warrant
 as soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant
 and in any event within ten (10) days thereafter
 the Company at its expense (including the payment by it of any applicable issue taxes) will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to Holder a certificate or certificates for the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled upon such exercise
 together with any other stock or other securities and property (including cash
 where applicable) to which Holder is entitled upon such exercise.


This Warrant may not be exercised as to fractional shares of Stock. &nbsp;In the event that the exercise of this Warrant
 in full or in part
 results in the issuance of any fractional share of Stock
 then in such event Holder shall be entitled to cash equal to the fair market value of such fractional share as determined by the Company's Board of Directors.
















ADJUSTMENT FOR DIVIDENDS
 &nbsp;In case at any time or from time to time the holders of Stock shall have received
 or (on or after the record date fixed for the determination of shareholders eligible to receive) shall have become entitled to receive

 other or additional (or less) stock or other securities or property (including cash) by way of automatic conversion

 on the date of the events described in subsections (a) and (b) above
 Holder had been the holder of record of the number of shares of Stock subject to such exercise and had thereafter
 during the period from the date of such events to and including the date of such exercise
 retained such shares and all such other or additional stock and other securities and property (including cash in the case referred to in subsection (b) of this Section 5) receivable by Holder as aforesaid during such period
 giving effect to all further adjustments called for during such period by Sections 6 and 7.


ADJUSTMENT FOR REORGANIZATION
 CONSOLIDATION
 MERGER
 ETC


 transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any other Person under any plan or arrangement contemplating the dissolution of the Company
 then in each such case on the exercise hereof as provided in Section 2 at any time after the consummation of such consolidation or merger or transfer of assets (and prior to the effective date of such dissolution)
 as the case may be
 Holder shall receive
 in lieu of the Stock issuable on such exercise prior to such consummation
 the stock and other securities and property (including cash) to which Holder would have been entitled upon such consummation or in connection with such dissolution
 as the case may be
 if Holder had so exercised this Warrant immediately prior thereto
 all subject to further adjustment thereafter as provided in Sections 5 and 7.


 &nbsp;Upon any consolidation or merger referred to in Section 6.1(a)
 this Warrant shall continue in full force and effect and the terms hereof shall be applicable to the shares of Stock and other securities and property receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant after the consummation of such merger or consolidation
 and shall be binding upon the issuer of any such Stock or other securities whether or not such person shall have expressly assumed the terms of this Warrant. &nbsp;Upon any partial exercise of this Warrant
 this Warrant shall continue in full force and effect and the terms hereof shall be applicable to the remaining unexercised shares of Stock covered hereby. &nbsp;Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding
 in the event of a transfer of assets as described in Section 6.1(b)
 this Warrant shall expire and be of no further force or effect upon the dissolution of the Company
 as and to the extent the Warrant is not properly exercised prior to the effective date of such dissolution.












 &nbsp;If at any time there shall occur any stock split
 stock dividend
 reverse stock split or other subdivision of Stock 
 then the number of shares of Stock to be received by the Holder of this Warrant shall be appropriately adjusted such that the proportion of the number of shares issuable hereunder immediately prior to such Stock Event to the total number of shares of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such Stock Event is equal to the proportion of the number of shares issuable hereunder immediately after such Stock Event to the total number of shares of the Company outstanding immediately after such Stock Event. &nbsp;The Exercise Price shall be proportionately decreased or increased upon the occurrence of any Stock Event.


 &nbsp;The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Stock
 solely for the purpose of issuance upon exercise of this Warrant
 a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of shares of Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in effect from time to time. &nbsp;The Company will from time to time
 in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida
 take action to increase the authorized amount of its Stock if at any time the number of shares of Stock authorized but remaining unissued and unreserved for other purposes shall be insufficient to permit the exercise of this Warrant in full. &nbsp;The Company will maintain an office where presentations and demands to or upon the Company in respect of this Warrant may be made. The Company will give notice in writing to Holder
 at the address of the Holder of this Warrant appearing on the books of the Company
 of each change in the location of such office.


 &nbsp;In case of any event that may require any adjustment or readjustment in the shares of Stock issuable on the exercise of this Warrant
 the Company at its expense will promptly prepare and send to Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
 the number of shares of Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis
 the number of shares of Stock to be received upon exercise of this Warrant
 as in effect immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as adjusted and readjusted (if required by Section 7) on account thereof
 and 


 any taking by the Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution

 unless and until Holder furnishes to the Company a different address or facsimile number.

 if any
 that it may legally be enforced and the validity
