 &#8220;we&#8221;
 &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;
 these words refer to Monster Beverage Corporation and its subsidiaries
 unless the context otherwise requires. Based in Corona
 California
 Monster Beverage Corporation is a holding company and conducts no operating business
We develop
 market
 sell and distribute energy drink beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages
The &#8220;alternative&#8221; beverage category combines non-carbonated
 ready-to-drink iced teas
 lemonades
 juice cocktails
 single-serve juices and fruit beverages
 ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks
 energy drinks
 sports drinks and single-serve still waters (flavored
 unflavored and enhanced) with &#8220;new age&#8221; beverages
 including sodas that are considered natural
 sparkling juices and flavored sparkling beverages. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation
 domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2019 for the &#8220;alternative&#8221; beverage category of the market are estimated at approximately $58.6 billion
We have three operating and reportable segments; (i) Monster Energy&#174; Drinks segment (&#8220;Monster Energy&#174; Drinks&#8221;)
 high performance energy drinks
 (ii) Strategic Brands segment (&#8220;Strategic Brands&#8221;)
 which is comprised primarily of the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (&#8220;TCCC&#8221;) in 2015
 as well as our affordable energy brands
 and (iii) Other segment (&#8220;Other&#8221;)
 which is comprised of certain products sold by American Fruits and Flavors
 LLC (&#8220;AFF&#8221;)
 a wholly-owned subsidiary
 to independent third-party customers (the &#8220;AFF Third-Party Products&#8221;). Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not specifically relate to a reportable segment have been allocated to &#8220;Corporate and unallocated.&#8221;
Our Monster Energy&#174; Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In some cases
 we sell directly to retail grocery and specialty chains
 wholesalers
 club stores
 mass merchandisers
 convenience chains
 drug stores
 foodservice customers
 value stores
Our Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling &#8220;concentrates&#8221; and/or &#8220;beverage bases&#8221; to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners
 water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold to other bottlers
 full service distributors or retailers
 including
 retail grocery and specialty chains
 wholesalers
 club stores
 mass merchandisers
 convenience chains
 foodservice customers
 drug stores
 value stores
 e-commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent
Generally
 the Monster Energy&#174; Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating revenues

In the 1930s
 Hubert Hansen and his sons started a business selling fresh non-pasteurized juices in Los Angeles
 California. In 1977
 Tim Hansen
 one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen
 perceived a demand for shelf stable pasteurized natural juices and juice blends and formed Hansen Foods
 Inc. (&#8220;HFI&#8221;). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansen&#8217;s Natural Soda&#174; brand sodas. In 1990
 California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a Hansen Beverage Company) (&#8220;CCC&#8221;) acquired certain assets of HFI
 including the right to market the Hansen&#8217;s&#174; brand name. In 1992
 Hansen Natural Corporation acquired the Hansen&#8217;s&#174; brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC. Under our ownership
 the Hansen&#8217;s&#174; beverage business significantly expanded to include a wide range of beverages within the growing &#8220;alternative&#8221; beverage category including
 in particular
 energy drinks. In 2012
 we changed our name from Hansen Natural Corporation to Monster Beverage Corporation. In 2015
 we acquired various energy brands from TCCC and disposed of our non-energy drink business. In 2016
During 2019
 we continued to expand our existing portfolio of drinks and further develop our distribution markets. During 2019
 we introduced the following products:

 but not limited to
 aluminum cans
 aluminum cap cans
 sleek aluminum cans
 aluminum cans with re-sealable ends as well as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles and to a limited extent glass bottles.

 boxes and other ingredients for our beverage products from ingredient suppliers
 which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases
 certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product
 the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including supplement ingredients) for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage
For our Strategic Brands segment
 we primarily purchase concentrates and/or beverage bases from ingredient suppliers
 which are then sold to certain of our various third-party bottlers/distributors. The third-party bottlers/distributors are responsible for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products
 including the procurement of all other required ingredients and packaging materials. For certain limited products in the Strategic Brands segment
 we may purchase flavors
 concentrates

 the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including supplement ingredients)
 for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage
All of our finished goods are manufactured by various third-party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad
In some instances
 subject to agreement
 certain equipment may be purchased exclusively by us and/or jointly with our co-packers
 and installed at their facilities to enable them to produce certain of our products. In certain cases
 such equipment remains our property and is required to be returned to us upon termination of the packing arrangements with such co-packers
For our Monster Energy&#174; Drinks segment
Our products are packaged in a number of locations
 both domestically and internationally
 which enables us to produce products closer to the markets where they are sold
 with the objective of reducing freight costs as well as transportation-related product damages. As distribution volumes increase in both our domestic and international markets
Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise
 particularly with new products
 and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth
 particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and/or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including
 but not limited to
 aluminum cans
 aluminum cap 
cans
 sleek aluminum cans
 aluminum cans with re-sealable ends
 PET plastic bottles

 flavors
 juice concentrates
 coffee

 supplement ingredients
 other ingredients and certain sweeteners
 and/or procure adequate packing arrangements and/or obtain adequate or timely shipment of our products
 we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. (See &#8220;Part I
Our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request. For many of our products
 including certain of our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks

 Thermogenic Fuel product line and certain of our other products
 there are limited co-packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment to package our products. We believe a short disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenues; however
 as alternative co-packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products
 either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period
 if at all
We continue to actively seek alternative and/or additional co-packing facilities around the world (including in Africa
 Asia
 Australia

During 2019
Distribution levels vary by product and geographic location. Net sales outside the United States were $1.33 billion
 $1.09 billion and $909.3 million for the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
We have entered into agreements with various bottlers/distributors providing for the distribution of our products during initial terms of up to twenty&#160;years
 which may be renewed thereafter for additional terms ranging from one to five&#160;years
 subject to certain terms and conditions which may vary depending on the form of the agreement. Such agreements remain in effect for their then-current term as long as our products are being distributed
 but are subject to specified termination rights held by each party
 which may include by way of example
 and depending on the form of agreement
 termination upon: mutual agreement; material breach of the agreement by
 or an insolvency of
 either party; deadlock; change of control; changes in legal or regulatory conditions and termination of certain related agreements. Additionally
 we are entitled to terminate certain distribution agreements at any time without cause upon payment of a termination fee
Certain of our material distribution arrangements for our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks
 as amended from time to time
Amended and Restated Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC
 pursuant to which we have designated
 and in the future may designate
 subject to TCCC&#8217;s approval
 territories in Canada and the United States in which bottlers from TCCC&#8217;s network of wholly or partially-owned and independent bottlers&#160;(the &#8220;TCCC North American Bottlers&#8221;) will distribute and sell
 or continue to distribute and sell
 our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks.
Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement with Coca-Cola Refreshments (&#8220;CCR&#8221;)
 pursuant to which CCR distributes
 directly and through certain sub-distributors
 our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks in a large portion of the United States. As of March&#160;1
 2018
 all of the territory previously falling under the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement with CCR has been assigned by CCR to various TCCC network bottlers in the United States
 including Coca-Cola Consolidated
 Inc. and Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling
Amended and Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC
 pursuant to which we have designated
 and in the future may designate
 countries
 or territories within countries
 in which we wish to appoint TCCC network bottlers to distribute and sell our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks
 subject to TCCC&#8217;s approval. In February 2020
Additionally
 we have entered into distribution agreements for certain of our Monster Energy&#174; products with various TCCC network bottlers
As of December 31
 2019
We have entered into distribution coordination agreements with TCCC pursuant to which we have designated
 and in the future may designate
 subject to TCCC&#8217;s approval
We have entered into agreements with various TCCC network bottlers
 both in the United States and internationally
The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are aluminum cans
 aluminum cap cans
 sleek aluminum cans
 aluminum cans with re-sealable ends
 PET plastic bottles
 caps
 as well as flavors
 juice concentrates
 glucose
 sugar
 sucralose
 milk
 cream
 protein
 coffee

 supplement ingredients and other packaging materials
AFF is the primary flavor supplier for our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks. We also purchase flavors from other suppliers as well as juices
 supplement ingredients
 glucose
 sugar
 sucralose
For our Strategic Brands energy drinks
 we purchase flavors
 concentrates and/or beverage bases from flavor suppliers including TCCC in the United States and abroad
With regard to our Java Monster&#174;
 Espresso Monster&#174;
 Caff&#233; Monster&#174; and Muscle Monster&#174; product lines
 the dairy
 protein and retort co-packing industries are subject to shortages and increased demand from time to time
For certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks and/or our Strategic Brands energy drinks
 these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. We do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of our blended concentrates
 and we may be unable to obtain comparable 
We have identified alternative suppliers for many of the ingredients contained in many of our beverages. However
 industry-wide shortages of certain flavors
 fruits and fruit juices
 coffee
 tea
 dairy-based products
 supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been
 and could from time to time in the future be
 encountered
We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of our flavors and concentrates purchased from third-party suppliers
 as well as to negotiate arrangements with our existing suppliers
 which would enable us to obtain access to certain of such concentrates or flavor formulas under certain circumstances. We have been partially successful in these endeavors. Additionally
 in a limited number of cases
 contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and licenses may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing
 packaging
 development of new products and flavors as well as promotional and marketing strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of companies
 many of which have substantially greater financial
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include brand and product image
 taste and flavor of products
 trade and consumer promotions
 rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting edge products
 ingredients
 attractive and different packaging
 brand exposure and marketing as well as pricing. We also rely on our bottlers and full service beverage distributors to allocate more attention to our products than those of our competitors
 provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the &#8220;alternative&#8221;
 energy
 coffee and &#8220;functional&#8221; beverage categories could cause our products to maintain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion
We have experienced and continue to experience competition from new entrants in the energy drink and energy shot categories. A number of companies who market and distribute iced teas
 coffees
 juice cocktails
 enhanced waters and sports drinks in various larger volume packages in glass and plastic bottles (including Bai
 Sobe Life Water
 BODYARMOR
 Vitamin Water
 CORE
 Snapple
 Arizona
 Fuse
 Ocean Spray
 Honest Tea
 Gold Peak Tea
 Powerade
 Gatorade Bolt 24 and Starbucks) and 12- and 16-ounce cans (such as Mountain Dew Kickstart and Mountain Dew Amp Game Fuel)
 have added supplement ingredients to their products with a view to marketing their products as &#8220;functional&#8221; or energy beverages or as having &#8220;functional&#8221; benefits. We believe that many of those products contain lower levels of supplement ingredients
We are also subject to increasing levels of regulatory issues including in relation to the registration and/or taxation of our products in certain new international markets
We compete not only for consumer preference
 but also for maximum marketing and sales efforts by multi-brand licensed bottlers
 brokers and distributors
 many of which have a principal affiliation with competing companies and brands. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in many cases with products of much larger and in some cases better financed competitors
 including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC
 PepsiCo
 Inc. (&#8220;PepsiCo&#8221;)
 Keurig Dr. Pepper
 Inc. (&#8220;KDP&#8221;) and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete with companies that 
are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains

Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image-enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize &#8220;push-pull&#8221; methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks
 coolers and barrel coolers)
 advertising
 in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions
 price promotions
 competitions
 endorsements from selected public and sports figures
 sports personality endorsements
 sampling and sponsorship of selected athletes
 teams
 series
 bands
 esports
 causes and events. In-store posters
 outdoor posters
 social media
 concerts
 print
We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation
 making our brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and
 where practical
 endeavor to make them different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned and refreshed from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification
 wherever they may be placed in stores
Where appropriate
We increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 10.9% in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased expenditures for social media
 sponsorships and endorsements as well 
as advertising. As of December 31

 the territories of certain TCCC Subsidiaries have been transitioned to certain independent TCCC bottlers/distributors and bottlers/distributors which TCCC accounts for under the equity method (the &#8220;TCCC Related Parties&#8221;). Accordingly
 our percentage of net sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries significantly decreased for the years ended December 31

Sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal
 with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. We believe that the volume of sales in the beverage industry is affected by weather conditions. However
 the energy drink category appears to be less seasonal than traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products
 the opening of new markets
 particularly internationally
 where temperature fluctuations may be more pronounced
 the addition of new bottlers and distributors

We protect our trademarks by applying for registrations and registering our trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with government agencies in other countries around the world
 particularly where our products are distributed and sold. &#160;We assert copyright ownership of the statements
 graphics and content appearing on the packaging of our products and in our marketing materials. &#160;We aggressively pursue individuals and/or entities seeking to profit from the unauthorized use of our trademarks and copyrights
 including
 without limitation
 wholesalers
 street vendors
 retailers
 online auction site sellers and website operators. In addition to initiating civil actions against these individuals and entities
Depending upon the jurisdiction
The production
 distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to various U.S. federal and state regulations
 including but not limited to: the Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FD&amp;C Act&#8221;); the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (&#8220;California Proposition 65&#8221;) and a number of other federal
 state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production
 transportation
 sale
 safety
 advertising
 marketing
 labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the 
United States
 the production
We also may in the future be affected by other existing
 proposed and potential future regulations or regulatory actions
 including those described below
 any of which could adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. See &#8220;Part I
 Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Changes in government regulation
 or failure to comply with existing regulations
 could adversely affect our business
Furthermore
 legislation may be introduced in the United States and other countries at the federal
 state and municipal level in respect of each of the subject areas discussed below. &#160;Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity
 especially as it affects children
 and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. There also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages
 as discussed below
Product Formulation
 Labeling and Advertising.
 we are subject to a number of regulations applicable to the formulation
 labeling and advertising of our products. In California
 we are subject to California Proposition 65
 a law which requires that a specified warning be provided before exposing California consumers to any product that contains in excess of threshold amounts of a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. California Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to an average daily quantity of a listed substance that is below that threshold amount
 which is determined either by scientific criteria set forth in applicable regulations or via a &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; threshold that may be established by the state
 or the substance is naturally occurring
 is the result of necessary cooking
 or is subject to another applicable exception. If we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold
 it will be difficult to predict whether
 or to what extent
In addition
 in May 2016
 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) revised regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products
 including a new requirement to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products. These changes went into effect on January 1
 2020
 though FDA announced that it will not enforce these provisions for the first six months after that date. Further
 in December 2018
 the U.S. Department of Agriculture promulgated regulations requiring that
 by January 1
 2022
 the labels of certain bioengineered foods must include a disclosure that the food is bioengineered. We may incur significant costs to alter our existing packaging materials to comply with these and other new regulations. Additionally
 these new regulations may impact
Further
 the City of San Francisco enacted an ordinance that would require health warnings on advertisements for certain sugar-sweetened beverages
 though enforcement has been delayed due to a lawsuit challenging the ordinance. In January 2019
 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
 sitting en banc
 granted a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the ordinance
 concluding that a First Amendment challenge to the ordinance was likely to succeed on the merits. &#160;In September 2019
 two members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors introduced legislation to amend the ordinance. The district court expressed its intent to assess the possible mootness of the current ordinance in light of the legislative proposal
In July 2012
 we received a subpoena from the Attorney General for the State of New York in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising
 marketing
 promotion
 ingredients
 usage and sale of our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks. We cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what effect
 if any
 it may have on our business
 financial condition or results of operations.
Other countries
 such as the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council
 Yemen
 Colombia
 Brazil
 the Dominican Republic
 Mexico
 and the People&#8217;s Republic of China are also considering new labeling requirements
Proposals to limit or restrict the sale and/or advertising of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age
 and/or restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold
 and/or to restrict the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps) to purchase energy drinks have been raised and/or enacted in certain U.S. states
 counties
 municipalities and/or in certain foreign countries. For example
 in the United States
 bills seeking to impose an age restriction on the sale of energy drinks have been introduced in the South Carolina and Connecticut legislatures. &#160;Outside of the United States
 for example
 Latvia
 Lithuania and Turkey prohibit the sale of energy drinks to persons under the age of 18; Canada prohibits the promotion of energy drinks to children 12 years and under; Latvia and Scotland prohibit the sale of energy drinks in educational establishments; and Turkey prohibits the sale or advertising of energy drinks in &#8220;collective consumption areas.&#8221; Latin American countries such as Chile
 Colombia and Brazil are considering age and other sales restrictions on energy drinks
 as are other European countries such as the United Kingdom
 Romania and Bulgaria
 and in the Middle East
 Legislation that would impose an excise tax on sweetened beverages has been proposed in the U.S. Congress
 in some state legislatures and by some local governments
 with excise taxes generally ranging between $0.01 and $0.02 per ounce of sweetened beverage. &#160;Berkeley
 California became the first jurisdiction to pass such a measure
 and a general tax of $0.01 per ounce on certain sweetened drinks
 including energy drinks
 became effective on January 1
 2015. Other U.S. jurisdictions (including Albany
 Oakland and San Francisco
 California; Boulder
 Colorado; Philadelphia
 Pennsylvania and Seattle
 Washington) have passed similar measures
 some of which have been challenged in litigation. The imposition of such taxes on our products would increase the cost of certain of our products or
 to the extent levied directly on consumers
 make certain of our products less affordable. Excise taxes on sweetened beverages already are in effect in certain foreign countries where we do business
 such as France
 the United Kingdom
 Ireland
 South Africa and Mexico. &#160;Other countries
 including Brazil
 are considering similar measures. In addition
 legislation has been proposed in certain jurisdictions that would specifically impose excise taxes on energy drinks. For example
 Estonia
 Poland and Ukraine are considering proposals that would impose an excise tax on energy drinks. Such targeted legislation has been passed in other countries. For instance
 on January 1
 2020
 a reform to a Mexican excise tax went into effect that expanded the definition of an &#8220;energy drink&#8221; subject to this tax to include products with any amount of caffeine (the prior version of the tax required a threshold of 20 milligrams of caffeine per 100 millimeters for the tax to be applicable) and &#8220;taurine or glucuronolactone or thiamine and/or any other substance that produces similar stimulating effects.&#8221; &#160;Hungary has instituted an excise tax to which our products are subject. Bahrain
 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates began applying a selective tax of 100% on energy drinks in 2017
 Qatar and Oman began applying the tax in 2019
. Legislation has been proposed to limit the amount of caffeine that may be contained in beverages
 including energy drinks. Some jurisdictions where we do business have prescribed limited caffeine content for beverages. For example
 on January 1
 2013
 new requirements took effect in Canada that limited the amount of caffeine contained in any beverage in a single-serving can or bottle to less than 180 milligrams
 and imposed limits on the concentration levels for caffeine. We adjusted the caffeine levels in certain of our Monster Energy&#174; products that are sold in Canada to address these regulations
 although the majority of our products were unaffected. &#160;In Europe
 examples of caffeine restrictions include the Netherlands where there is a limit of 35mg/100ml
 and Norway introduced
 as of January 1
 2020 (subject to transition periods)
 a limit of 32mg/100ml. &#160;Caffeine limit restrictions or restrictions on combining caffeine with other ingredients or in particular product sectors (such as performance beverages/sport drinks) have also been implemented or proposed in other jurisdictions
 including Turkey
 India and Pakistan&#8217;s Punjab region. Such restrictions 
could require reformulations of certain of our products. However
We package our products in a variety of different package types and sizes including
 for certain of our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks
 aluminum cans larger than 16 fluid ounces. Certain jurisdictions
 such as the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council
 Yemen
 Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic
 are considering container size limitations on energy drinks and other beverages which may require us to change the size of our products sold in these countries. &#160;Other countries
 like England
Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal
 state and local environmental laws and regulations. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar laws and regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Compliance with these provisions has not had
 nor do we expect such compliance to have
 any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures
 Various municipalities
 states and foreign countries require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary by jurisdiction. Other deposit
 recycling or product stewardship proposals have been
 and may in the future be
 introduced in certain U.S. states
 counties
In California
 we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and to remit such redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain other states and countries where our products are sold
As of December 31
 2019
 we employed a total of 3

Corona
In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 including Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes
 you should carefully consider the following risks. If any of the following risks actually occur or continue to occur
 our business
 reputation
 financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. The risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business
 reputation
The Company and TCCC have extensive commercial arrangements and
 as a result
We have transitioned all third parties&#8217; rights to distribute the Company&#8217;s products in the U.S. to members of TCCC&#8217;s distribution network
 which largely consists of independent bottlers/distributors. In addition
 TCCC has become our preferred distribution partner globally with members of TCCC&#8217;s network distributing our products internationally
 including in Africa
 Asia
 Canada
 Central and South America
 Europe
 Mexico and the Middle East. As we continue our international expansion
 we expect TCCC&#8217;s distribution network to continue as our preferred distribution partner globally. As a result
TCCC has a substantial equity investment in the Company. The Company
 TCCC and certain affiliates are parties to various agreements in which TCCC and certain affiliates have agreed
 subject to certain exceptions
 not to compete in the energy drink category in certain territories prior to the termination of the applicable distribution coordination agreement with TCCC. The Company&#8217;s distribution agreements with TCCC distributors also provide
 subject to certain exceptions
While we believe that these agreements incentivize TCCC to take steps to ensure that our products receive the appropriate attention in the TCCC distribution system
 there can be no assurance of this as disagreements as to the interpretation of the provisions in such agreements may arise and TCCC is a much larger company with many strategic priorities. In October 2018
 the Company and TCCC mutually agreed to submit to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association the issue of whether TCCC is permitted to manufacture
 market
 sell or distribute three energy drink products it developed. &#160;On June 28
 2019
 the arbitration tribunal issued a final award in favor of TCCC. &#160;TCCC launched Coca-Cola Energy in Europe in 2019 and in the United States in 2020. &#160;As TCCC proceeds to launch Coca-Cola Energy in additional territories
 we may encounter difficulties in maintaining distributor attention
 market share or position in the energy drink category in such territories
In addition
 TCCC does not control all members of its distribution system
 many of which are independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with TCCC&#8217;s interests. Moreover
 it is possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements regardless of TCCC&#8217;s priorities or the priorities of the members of TCCC&#8217;s distribution system.
We derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks
Our focus is in the energy drink category
 and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the energy drink category and business
Virtually all of our sales are derived from our energy drinks
 including our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks
 energy drinks and our Strategic Brands energy drinks (including our affordable brand energy drinks
 principally Predator&#174;). Any decrease in the sales of our Monster Energy&#174; brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Historically
 we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. Domestically

The increasing number of competitive products and limited amount of shelf space in retail stores may adversely impact our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the marketplace. In addition
 certain actions of our competitors
 including unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims
 false advertising claims and tortious interference in our business
 as well as competitors selling misbranded products
 could impact our sales. Competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues
 cause price erosion and/or lower market share
 any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The Company
 in several markets
 owns multiple potentially competing brands in the energy drink category
Our various Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks compete with one another
 and
 in several markets
 our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks and Strategic Brands compete with each other. We may encounter difficulties managing different and potentially competing brands in such shared markets
As of February 20
 2020
TCCC&#8217;s ownership could also have an effect on the Company&#8217;s ability to engage in a change in control transaction. TCCC is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of the Company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common shares not owned by TCCC with respect to a proposal for a change of control. However
 if TCCC were to oppose such a change-in-control transaction
 a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of 62.5% of the Company&#8217;s common shares not owned by TCCC (assuming that TCCC increased its ownership to 20% of the Company&#8217;s common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. In addition
 TCCC would have a bidding advantage if the Company&#8217;s board of directors were to seek to sell the Company in the future because TCCC would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. TCCC and the Company would also be permitted to terminate TCCC&#8217;s distribution coordination agreements with the Company after a change in control of the Company. In such event
 TCCC would receive a termination fee if TCCC terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the Company involving certain TCCC competitors
The interests of TCCC may be different from or conflict with the interests of the Company&#8217;s other shareholders and
 as a result
 TCCC&#8217;s influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or transactions
 including a potential change of management or control of the Company
 even if such action or transaction may be beneficial to the Company&#8217;s other shareholders. Moreover
Changes in government regulation
 or failure to comply with existing regulations
 could adversely affect our business
Legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S. federal
 state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including
 prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs)
 limit the content of caffeine and other ingredients in beverages
 require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings
 impose excise taxes
 limit product size or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. For a discussion of certain of such legislation
 see &#8220;Part I
 Item 1 &#8211; Business &#8211; Government Regulation.&#8221; Furthermore
 additional legislation may be introduced in the United States and other countries at the federal
 state
 local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. &#160;For instance
 on January 1
 2020
 a reform to a Mexican excise tax went into effect that expanded the definition of an &#8220;energy drink&#8221; subject to this tax to include products with any amount of caffeine (the prior version of the tax required a threshold of 20 milligrams of caffeine per 100 millimeters for the tax to be applicable) and &#8220;taurine or glucuronolactone or thiamine and/or any other substance that produces similar stimulating effects.&#8221; &#160;Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the 
public health consequences associated with obesity
 especially as it affects children
 and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. &#160;There also has been increased focus on caffeine content in beverages
 and we are seeing some attention to other ingredients in energy drinks. To the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold
 individually or in the aggregate
 it could result in a reduction in demand for
 or availability of
 our energy drinks
 and adversely affect our business
The production
 distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations
 including
 but not limited to: the FD&amp;C Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; data privacy laws; California Proposition 65; and various other federal
 state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production
 transportation
 sale
 safety
 advertising
 labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States
 the production
 distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations. &#160;If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product
 its label
 or a production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations
 we may be fined
 or the products in question may have to be recalled
 removed from the market
 reformulated and/or have the packaging changed
 which could adversely affect our business
We cannot predict the effect of possible inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general
 other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production
 advertising
 marketing
 promotion
 labeling
 ingredients
We are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising
 marketing
 promotion
 ingredients
 usage and/or sale of our energy drinks
 and we are a party
 from time to time
 to various government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings. &#160;Defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management&#8217;s time and attention from the operation of our business
In addition
 from time to time
 government and/or quasi-governmental agencies may investigate the safety of caffeine and energy drinks. For example
 in January 2013
 the Company received and responded to inquiries from U.S. legislators in response to FDA&#8217;s investigation into the safety of caffeine in food products
 particularly its effects on children and adolescents. These legislators ultimately released a report in January 2015
 recommending
 inter alia
 that the energy drink industry not market to consumers under the age of 18 and not market their products for hydration
 and that the FDA develop and release definitions and guidance for this market sector. &#160;In addition
 other organizations
 such as the European Food Safety Authority
 have also published reports
 studies
 articles and opinions on caffeine and energy drinks. &#160;If an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising
 marketing
 promotion
 ingredients
 usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations
 we may become subject to fines
 product reformulations
 container changes
 changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising
 marketing and promotion practices
 each of which could have an adverse effect on our business
Litigation regarding our products
 and related unfavorable media attention
 could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products
We have been and are a party
 from time to time
 to various litigation claims and legal proceedings
 including
 but not limited to
 intellectual property
 fraud
 unfair business practices
 false advertising
 product liability
 breach of contract claims
 securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. &#160;In particular
 we have been and are currently named as a defendant in personal injury lawsuits which allege that consumption of our products has been responsible for wrongful deaths and/or injuries. We do not believe that our products are responsible for such wrongful deaths and/or injuries
 and we intend to vigorously defend such lawsuits.
Other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law
 and/or that our products are not safe. Putative class action lawsuits have also been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. &#160;We do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local law
Any of the foregoing matters or other litigation
 the threat thereof
 or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in decreased demand for our products
 significant monetary awards against us
 an injunction barring the sale of any of our products and injury to our reputation. &#160;Our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that
 to the extent not covered by our insurance
 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
 revenue and profitability
Criticism of our energy drink products and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally
An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine
 or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content and/or any other ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally
 including product safety concerns
 could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. Articles critical of the caffeine content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks and/or articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. We believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the U.S. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks
 and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine)
 and/or the levels thereof
 and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. In early 2018
 certain retailers in the United Kingdom announced the introduction of voluntary retailer measures to prevent the sale of energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. If reports
 studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future
 or additional voluntary measures are taken
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing
 packaging
 development of new products
 flavors
 product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers
 some of which have substantially greater financial
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products
 trade and consumer promotions
 rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting edge products
 attractive and different packaging
 branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors
 including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC
 PepsiCo
 Red Bull GmbH and KDP. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. Our products also compete with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains
The rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers
 e-commerce websites
 mobile commerce applications and subscription services
 and closures of physical retail operations
 may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels and a reduction in impulse purchases. &#160;As we build our e-commerce capabilities
 we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. &#160;Further
 the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. &#160;
Sales in gas chains may also be affected by improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer preferences for electric or alternative fuel-powered vehicles
 which may result in fewer trips by consumers to gas stations and a corresponding reduction in purchases by consumers in convenience gas retailers. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape
 our share of sales
Due to competition in the beverage industry
 there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues
 market share or position in the beverage industry. If our revenues decline
 our business
Our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business growth objectives depends
 in part
 on our ability to develop new flavors
 products and packaging. The success of our innovation
 in turn
 depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. If we are not successful in our innovation activities
 our business
Uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry
Global economic uncertainties
 including foreign currency exchange rates
 affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways
 making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. There can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur
 or that they would be sustainable
 or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. In addition
 we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our customers or business
 as our expansion outside of the United States has increased our exposure to any developments or crises in African
 Asian
 European and other international markets. Unfavorable economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets and unstable political conditions
 including civil unrest and governmental changes
 in certain of our other international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers&#8217; purchasing power
 thereby reducing demand for our products. &#160;Included in the foregoing are uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union on January 31
 2020 (commonly referred to as &#8220;Brexit&#8221;) and any resulting increases in tariffs
 importation restrictions
 out of stocks
 volatility in currency exchange rates
 including the valuation of the euro and the British pound in particular
 changes in the laws and regulations applied in the United Kingdom or impacts on economic and market conditions in the United Kingdom
The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. There is increasing awareness of and concern for health
 wellness and nutrition considerations
 including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients. Some consumer advocacy groups and others have expressed concerns regarding certain ingredients in diet sodas
 which are contained in certain of our energy drinks. &#160;This may reduce demand for our beverages
Consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. Our future success will depend
 in part
 upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. In order to retain and expand our market share
 we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste
 quality and price
 although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. Product lifecycles for some beverage brands
 products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers&#8217; preferences change. The beverages we currently 
market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles
 and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. We may also be unable to penetrate new markets. Additionally
 as shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution
 with customers embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications
 e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms
 we may be unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences. If our revenues decline
 our business
We have continued expanding our operations internationally into a variety of new markets
 including launches in China and various African and Middle Eastern countries. Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 33%
 31% and 28% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. As our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business
 if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the United States
 our growth rate could be adversely affected. In many international markets
 we have limited operating experience and in some international markets we have no operating experience. It is costly to establish
 develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. Our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the United States. We face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations
 including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States
 including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. Also
 our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions
 potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations
 higher product damages
 particularly when products are shipped long distances
 potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption
Because of our increasingly global presence
 our business could be affected by unstable political conditions
 civil unrest
 large-scale terrorist acts
 especially those directed against the United States or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed
 the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities
 major natural disasters and extreme weather conditions
 such as hurricanes
 wildfires
 tornados
 earthquakes or floods
 or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. &#160;Such catastrophic events could impact our operations and our supply chain
 including the production and/or distribution of our products. &#160;Materials and/or personnel may need to mobilize to other locations. Our headquarters and a large part of our operations are located in California
 a state at greater risk of earthquakes and wildfires. &#160;Some of the raw materials we use
 including certain sizes of cans
 are available from limited suppliers
 and a regional catastrophic event impacting such suppliers could adversely impact our operations. &#160;In addition
 such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity
 which could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers&#8217; ability to purchase our products
 thereby reducing demand for our products. If our operations are disrupted or we are unable to grow our business as a result of these factors
 our growth rate could decline and our business
Our business and operations
 and the operations of our suppliers
We and our suppliers currently globally source certain ingredients for our products from third-party manufacturers in Wuhan (Hubei Province) and other parts of China
 manufacture finished goods through third-party bottlers and co-packers 
in China and have employees in China. &#160;The recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus (or COVID-19)
 and other adverse public health developments
 could adversely affect our business and cause disruptions due to the closure or suspension of activities at such third-party manufacturers as well as at our co-packing facilities and our China office. Certain aspects of our operations currently in China may need to be moved
 even temporarily
 to other locations. &#160;In addition
 the outbreak
 together with any accompanying special government measures
 including general movement restrictions
 travel restrictions and business closures imposed to slow its spread
 could adversely impact the growth of our business in China and affect demand for our products
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales
 expenses
 profits
 assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may enter into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries&#8217; non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. We have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. As a result
 our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover
 any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. Foreign currency transaction losses were $4.1 million
 $4.0 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
As part of any hedging activities that we may conduct
 we may enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments
 including forward contracts
 commodity futures contracts
 option contracts
 collars and swaps
 with various financial institutions. We also have significant amounts of cash
 cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions both in the United States and abroad
 exposing us to risk of default by or failure of such counterparty financial institutions. This risk of counterparty default or failure is greater during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty in financial markets. If one of our counterparties became insolvent or filed for bankruptcy
We rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us
Our acquisition of AFF in 2016 brought our primary flavor supplier in-house for the majority of our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks. However
 we also procure flavors from other independent flavor suppliers. We do not manufacture finished goods
 but instead outsource manufacturing of our finished goods to bottlers and other contract packers. As a result
 in the event of a disruption and/or delay
 we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. In addition
 there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products
 including certain of our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks
 our Muscle Monster&#174; product line
 our Java Monster&#174; product line
 our Espresso Monster&#174; product line
 our Caff&#233; Monster&#174; product line
 our Monster Hydro&#174; product line and certain of our other products. For example
 in recent years
 sales of our Java Monster&#174; and Muscle Monster&#174; product lines were adversely impacted by production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with certain of our co-packers. While this disruption in production did not significantly affect our revenues
 a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of our products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products
 because alternative co-packing facilities in the United States and abroad with adequate long-
term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates and/or costs and/or within a reasonably short time period
 if at all. In addition
 recently there has been a consolidation of co-packers. &#160;If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our largest co-packers
 or if our costs of co-packing increase
 our business
We rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors
Many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda
 carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). In many cases
Unilateral decisions could be taken by our bottlers/distributors
 convenience and gas chains
 grocery chains
 specialty chain stores
 club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying certain or all of our products that they are carrying at any time

 our business
The principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans
 sleek aluminum cans
 aluminum cap cans
 aluminum cans with re-sealable ends
 PET plastic bottles
 caps
 flavors
 juice concentrates
 glucose
 sugar
 sucralose
 milk
 cream
 protein
 coffee
 tea
 cocoa
 supplement ingredients and other packaging materials
 the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. For certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our Monster Energy&#174; brand energy drinks and/or our Strategic Brands energy drinks
 these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. We do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of our blended concentrates
 and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. Our third-party flavor suppliers 
generally do not make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third-party customers. We have identified alternative suppliers for certain of the ingredients contained in many of our beverages. However
 industry-wide shortages of certain flavors
 fruits and fruit juices
 coffee
 tea
 cocoa
 dairy-based products
 supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been
 and could from time to time in the future be
 encountered
 which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. Ingredient sourcing delays following the coronavirus (or COVID-19) outbreak could also interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. In addition
 certain of our co-packing arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their fees based on certain of their own cost increases. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients
 certain of which have recently risen
 will continue to rise or may rise in the future. We are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. Although we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials
 from time to time
 we
 through our aluminum can suppliers
 enter into purchase agreements for the purchase of aluminum
 as well as enter into purchase agreements for portions of our annual anticipated requirements for certain of our other raw materials such as glucose
 sugar and sucralose. In 2018
 the United States imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other countries. &#160;Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports
 or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response
We may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise
 particularly with regard to new products
 and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth
 particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including
 but not limited to
 aluminum cans
 aluminum cap cans
 sleek aluminum cans
 aluminum cans with re-sealable ends
 PET plastic bottles
 caps
 labels
 sucralose
 flavors
 supplement ingredients
 juice concentrates
 certain sweeteners
 coffee
 tea
 cocoa
 protein and packaging materials or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements
 including production shortages or quality issues
 we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover
 industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates
 supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been and could
 from time to time in the future
 be experienced
If we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels
 if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities
 and/or if our customers&#8217; or retailers&#8217; inventory levels are too high
If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory
 our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our shipping schedules
 we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers
 increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis
 we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high
 they will not place orders for additional products
The costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time
Many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies
 such as aluminum for cans
 PET plastic for bottles and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. These changes in the prices we pay 
for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. In some cases
 we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. In other cases
 we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies
 including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. We do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. If the costs of these packaging supplies increase
 we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge
Our intellectual property rights are critical to our success
We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. We also own the copyright in
 and to
 a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. We regard our trademarks
 copyrights and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. However
 there can be no assurance that other parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks
 copyrights and similar proprietary rights. In 2019
 Vital Pharmaceuticals
 Inc. (&#8220;VPX&#8221;) announced its intention to launch its own line of &#8220;Reign&#8221;-branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. &#160;We filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction to stop this product launch and to prevent this infringement of our trademarks
 and in January 2020 the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the injunction be granted in our favor. &#160;A number of proceedings are currently ongoing to adjudicate claims
 including claims for false advertising and trademark infringement
 brought by the Company against VPX and by VPX against the Company. &#160;Certain proceedings could result in an injunction barring us from selling &#8220;Reign Total Body Fuel&#8221; branded energy drinks and/or require changes to be made to our current trade dress. &#160;If we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights
 or an injunction prevents us from selling any of our products
Negative publicity (whether or not warranted) concerning product safety or quality
 human and workplace rights
 obesity or other issues could damage our brand image and corporate reputation
Our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products
 new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. There can be no assurance that our advertising
 marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product safety and quality and human rights will have the desired impact on our products&#8217; brand image and on consumer preferences and demand. Product safety
 quality and/or ingredient content issues
 efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined)
 our environmental impact
 or allegations of product contamination
 even if false or unfounded
 could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Consumer demand for our products could diminish significantly if we
 our employees
 &#160;bottlers/distributors
 suppliers or business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products
 act or are perceived to act in an unethical
 illegal
 discriminatory
 unequal or socially irresponsible manner
 including with respect to the sourcing
 content or sale of our products
 service and treatment of our customers
 or the use of customer data. &#160;Furthermore
 our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation
 unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere)
 studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. &#160;Negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or any one of our brands
 even if inaccurate or malicious
 could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. &#160;Business incidents
 whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us
 our bottlers/distributors
 suppliers or business partners
 that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value or potentially trigger boycotts of our products and can have a negative impact on our reputation and financial results. &#160;The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity
In addition
 from time to time
 there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business. These public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups 
that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction
 including product boycotts. Similarly
 our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support. &#160;Likewise
 campaigns by activists connecting us
 or our supply chain
 with human and workplace rights or animal rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. We have made a number of commitments to respect human rights
 including the policies and initiatives described in our California Transparency in Supply Chains Act &amp; United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act statement
. Allegations
 even if untrue
 that we are not respecting one or more of the 30 human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws
 including child labor laws
 or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products
 water usage
 environmental impact
 labor relations or the like could negatively affect our Company&#8217;s overall reputation and brand image
If we encounter product recalls
We may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers
 markets
 retailers or batches if such products become contaminated
 damaged
If we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management
Our business is dependent
 to a large extent
 upon the services of our senior management. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. The loss of services of either Rodney Sacks
 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
 Hilton Schlosberg
 Vice Chairman
 President and Chief Financial Officer
 or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions
There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products
 changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions
 and/or outbreaks of diseases or other health issues
 which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients
 juice concentrates
 supplements and other ingredients used in our products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. &#160;Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities
 disrupt our supply chain (including
 without limitation
 the availability of
 and/or result in higher prices for
 juice concentrates
 natural flavors and other ingredients) and/or impact demand for our products. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions
 such as hurricanes
 wildfires
 earthquakes or floods
 may affect our operations and the operation of our supply chain
 impact the operations of our bottlers/distributors and unfavorably impact our consumers&#8217; ability to purchase our products. The predicted effects of climate change may also result in challenges regarding availability and quality of water
 or less favorable pricing for water
 which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition
 public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy
 transportation and raw material costs
 and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result
 the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. We
 our bottlers and our 
contract packers use a number of key ingredients in the manufacture of our beverage products that are derived from agricultural commodities such as sugar
 coffee
 tea and cocoa. Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns and other factors may limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. &#160;Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages
 which could have an effect on our operations
We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. New accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues
 expenses
 assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. Equally
We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Therefore
At any given time
 events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax audits will be resolved and thus
 there could be significant variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates
Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or the manner in which U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings
 including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced
 could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. For example
 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (&#8220;BEPS&#8221;) project. These changes
 to the extent adopted
 may increase tax uncertainty
 result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes
 results of operations and/or cash flow. &#160;In connection with the OECD&#8217;s BEPS project
 companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world
 which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate
 or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation
 may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals
Our stock price is affected by a number of factors
 including stockholder expectations
 financial results
 the introduction of new products by us and our competitors
 general economic and market conditions
 estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation
 many of which are beyond our control. We do not provide guidance on our future performance
 including
 but not limited to
 our revenues
 margins
 product mix
 operating expenses or net income. We may be unable to achieve analysts&#8217; net revenue and/or earnings forecasts
 which are based on their own projected revenues
 sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products
 certain of which are more profitable than others
 as well as their own estimates of gross margin 
and operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mix of product sales
 revenues
 gross margins
 operating profits and/or net income. As a result
 our stock price is subject to significant volatility
 and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. In addition
 periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. During the fiscal year ended December 31
 2019
Our organizational documents may limit changes in control. Furthermore
 as of February 20
 2020
 Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 10.1% of our outstanding common stock. As of February 20
 2020
 TCCC owned approximately 19% of our common stock. Consequently
 Mr. Sacks
 Mr. Schlosberg and TCCC could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders
 including electing directors
 amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt
At December 31
 2019
 we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $546.0 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. treasuries
 certificates of deposit
 commercial paper
 U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature)
 variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit
 liquidity
 market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations
Under GAAP
 we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include
 declining or slower than anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing products
 a decline in stock price and market capitalization
We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. As of December 31
 2019
If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis
We are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in &#8220;Part&#160;II
&#160;Item&#160;9A&#160;&#8211; Controls and Procedures.&#8221; If we fail to maintain such controls and procedures
 our business
 results of operations
 financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed.
We must continually maintain
 protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems
Information technology enables us to operate efficiently
 interface with customers
 maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure
 we could be subject to transaction errors
 processing inefficiencies
 the loss of customers
 business disruptions
 and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches
 including internal and external cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include
 but are not limited to
 malicious software (malware
 ransomware and viruses)
 phishing and social engineering
 attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks
 computer systems and data
 malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of information they are entitled to access) and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems
 an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders
We rely on relationships with third parties
 including suppliers
 distributors
 bottlers
 contract packers
 contractors
 cloud data storage and other information technology service providers and other external business partners
 for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. These third-party service providers and partners
 with whom we may share data
 are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity
 privacy violations
 business interruption
 and systems
 as well as employee failures. &#160;While we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners
 we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems
 practices and procedures
 which increases our financial
 legal
We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. However
 given the unpredictability of the timing
 nature and scope of such disruptions
 we could potentially be subject to operational interruption
Moreover
 if our data management systems
 including our SAP enterprise resource planning system
 do not effectively collect
 store
 process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints
 software deficiencies
 cybersecurity attack and/or human error)
 our ability to effectively plan
 forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired
 perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition
 results of operations
If we fail to comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws
 we could be subject to adverse publicity
 government enforcement actions and/or private litigation

&#160;&#8211; The introduction
 development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy&#174; brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. One or more of our products are distributed in approximately 153 countries and territories worldwide.
&#160;&#8211; We believe &#8220;functional&#8221; value-added brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base
 high performance energy drinks in the first quarter of 2019. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our Monster Energy&#174; Drinks segment and our Strategic Brands segment
 and believe that tailored branding
 packaging
&#160;&#8211; The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis
 including raw material costs and co-packing fees
 as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances
 selling and general and administrative costs
 including sponsorships
 sampling
 promotional and marketing expenses
&#160;&#8211; Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion
 both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position
 our ability to raise funds
 if necessary
 at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings
We believe that
 subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained
 these value drivers
 when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally
Gross and net sales
 gross profit
 operating income
 net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2020 and beyond (See &#8220;Part&#160;II

 2019
 Compared to the&#160;Year Ended December&#160;31
As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had working capital of $1.66 billion compared to $1.20 billion as of December 31
 2018. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of the $1.12 billion of net income earned during the year ended December 31
 2019. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.11 billion as compared to $1.16 billion for the year ended December 31
 2018. Principal uses of cash flows in 2019
 were purchases of investments
 repurchase of our common stock
 development of our Monster Energy&#174; brand internationally and acquisitions of property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See &#8220;Part II
Opportunities
Looking forward
 our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company
 including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC&#8217;s status as a significant shareholder of the Company
 in each case as described above under &#8220;Part&#160;I
In addition
 legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S.
 state
 county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs)
 limit caffeine content
 require 
certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings
 impose taxes
 limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition
 articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles
 or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles
 may adversely affect our Company. In addition
 uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore
 our growth strategy includes expanding our international business
 which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations
 including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet
 light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation
 choice and variety. (See &#8220;Part&#160;I
Our historical success is attributable
 in part
 to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend
 in part
 upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences
 although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share
 we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price
 quality
 method of distribution
In addition
 other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company&#8217;s future financial results include
economic uncertainty in the United States
maintenance of our brand image
increasing concern over various environmental
 human rights and health matters
 including obesity
 caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally
profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See &#8220;Part&#160;I
&#160;Item&#160;1&#160;&#8211; Business&#160;&#8211; Competition&#8221; and &#8220;Part&#160;I
restrictions on imports and sources of supply
 duties or tariffs
 changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients due to port strikes
limitations on co-packing availability
 particularly for retort production as well for 550ml products utilizing BRE resealable lids;
the imposition of additional regulation
 including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks
 limiting caffeine content in beverages
 requiring product labeling and/or warnings
 imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes

**Gross sales are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance
 including sales performance of particular products
 salesperson performance
 product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items
 which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales
 which is determined in 
accordance with GAAP
 and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally
 gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies
 as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition

***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements
 the presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally
 our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to our bottlers/distributors or retail customers including
 but not limited to the following: (i)&#160;discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii)&#160;reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers
 including slotting
 shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii)&#160;our agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising
 in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv)&#160;our agreed share of slotting
 shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers
 club stores and/or wholesalers; (v)&#160;incentives given to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi)&#160;discounted or free products; (vii)&#160;contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers&#8217;/distributors&#8217; sales territories; and (viii)&#160;certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations
 ranging from one week to one&#160;year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2019 and 2018 were (i)&#160;to increase sales volume and trial
 (ii)&#160;to address market conditions
Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A &#8220;unit case&#8221; means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates
 as if converted into finished products
Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer&#160;months of the&#160;year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar&#160;year. In addition
 our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products
 the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more 
pronounced
 the addition of new bottlers/distributors and customers
 changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses. (See &#8220;Part&#160;I

 2019
 we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents
 $533.1 million in short-term investments and $12.9 million in long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. treasuries
 U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature)
 certificates of deposit
 commercial paper
 variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However
 certain of these investments are subject to general credit
 liquidity
 market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations
Of our $798.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31
 2019
 $416.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31
We believe that cash available from operations
 including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit
 will be sufficient for our working capital needs
 including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory
 increases in accounts receivable
 payments of tax liabilities
 expansion and development needs
 purchases of shares of our common stock
 as well as purchases of capital assets
 equipment and properties
 through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans
 capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are currently estimated to be approximately $150.0 million through December 31
 2020. &#160;However
 future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.

&#8211; The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year
&#160;&#8211; The Company&#8217;s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity
 available-for-sale or trading
 in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell 
in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
 where available. Under FASB ASC 320-10-35
 a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the &#8220;Credit Loss&#8221;) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis and the investor intends
 or will be required
 to sell the security before recovery of the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists
 the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security
 and will not be required to sell the security
 before recovery of the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss
 net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management
 and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held
 market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer&#8217;s financial condition and
 if applicable
 information on the guarantors&#8217; financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment&#8217;s fair value has been less than its cost basis
 the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors
The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer&#8217;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company&#8217;s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45

&#160;&#8211; The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired
 including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis
 or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value
 the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value
 including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting 
unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process
 performed only if a potential impairment exists
 involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit&#8217;s net assets
 other than goodwill
 and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the&#160;years ended December&#160;31

 as well as in a number of countries around the world. In addition
 in 2016 through our acquisition of AFF
 we secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy&#174; Brand energy drinks in perpetuity. In accordance with FASB ASC 350
 intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually
 or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the years ended December 31
 2019
&#8211; Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets
 including certain definite-lived intangible assets
 for possible impairment. This review occurs annually
 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment
 management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management&#8217;s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management&#8217;s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions.

&#160;&#8211; The accounts of the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income
 net
 at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders&#8217; equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e.
 settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders&#8217; equity. During the years ended December 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities.

&#160;&#8211; The Company&#8217;s Monster Energy&#174; Drinks segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In some cases
 the 
Company sells directly to retail grocery and specialty chains
 wholesalers
 club stores
 mass merchandisers
 convenience chains

 value retailers
The Company&#8217;s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling &#8220;concentrates&#8221; and/or &#8220;beverage bases&#8221; to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners
 water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold to other bottlers and full service distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains
 wholesalers
 club stores
 mass merchandisers
 convenience chains
 foodservice customers
 drug stores and the military. To a lesser extent
The majority of the Company&#8217;s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance obligation by transferring control of its products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when the Company&#8217;s products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying contracts or agreements. Certain of the Company&#8217;s bottlers/distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the Company&#8217;s behalf. In such cases
 control of the Company&#8217;s products passes to such bottlers/distributors when they notify the Company that they have taken possession or transferred the relevant portion of the Company&#8217;s finished goods. The Company&#8217;s general payment terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. The Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31
 2019 and December 31
Distribution expenses to transport the Company&#8217;s products

The Company&#8217;s promotional allowance programs with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations
 ranging from one week to one&#160;year. The Company&#8217;s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers
 and accruals are established during the&#160;year for its anticipated liabilities.&#160;These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company&#8217;s historical experience with similar programs and require management&#8217;s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such 
Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors
 relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company&#8217;s prior distributors
 are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements
The Company also enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated with third-party sales of non-beverage products bearing our trademarks including

 warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company&#8217;s finished products and certain quality control costs. In addition
 the Company includes in costs of sales certain costs such as depreciation
 amortization and payroll costs that relate to the direct manufacture by the Company of certain flavors and concentrates. Raw materials account for the largest portion of cost of sales. Raw materials include cans
 bottles
 other containers
 flavors
&#160;&#8211; Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture
 as well as expenses for advertising

 termination payments made to certain of the Company&#8217;s prior distributors
&#160;&#8211; The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method
 deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the&#160;years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets
 an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all&#160;years subject to examination based upon the Company&#8217;s evaluation of the facts
 circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained
 the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See &#8220;Part I
 Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors
&#8221; for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently
 our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates
 forecasts and projections
 and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties
 you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements
 and the estimates and assumptions associated with them
 after the date of this report
In the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e.
 the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including
 but not limited to
 increases in the costs of juice concentrates
 increases in the price of aluminum for cans
 as well as sugar and other sweeteners
 glucose
 sucrose
 milk
 cream
 protein
 coffee and tea
 all of which are used in some or many of our products)
 fluctuations in energy and fuel prices
Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 33% and 31% of consolidated gross sales for the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result
 we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During the&#160;year 
ended December&#160;31
 2019
 we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries&#8217; non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December&#160;31
We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB ASC 815. Therefore
 gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other income
 net
 in the consolidated statements of income
 and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31
As of December 31
 2019
 we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $546.0 million in short-term and long-term investments including certificates of deposit

 we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules&#160;13(a)-15(e)&#160;and 15(d)-15(e)&#160;of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation
 the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1)&#160;recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules&#160;and forms of the SEC and (2)&#160;accumulated and communicated to our management
&#160;&#8211; Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as defined in Exchange Act Rules&#160;13a-15(f)&#160;and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31
 2019
 based on the framework in 
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&#160;31

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Monster Beverage Corporation and subsidiaries (the&#160;&#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December&#160;31
 2019
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;). In our opinion
 the Company maintained
 in all material respects
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31

We have also audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;)
 the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the&#160;year ended December&#160;31

 of the Company and our report dated February&#160;28
 2020
The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
 testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk
A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&#160;pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&#160;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&#160;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Monster Beverage Corporation and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December&#160;31
 2019 and 2018
 the related consolidated statements of income
 comprehensive income
 stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows
 for each of the three years in the period ended December&#160;31
 2019
 and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)&#160;(collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December&#160;31
 2019 and 2018
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&#160;31
 2019
We have also audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;)
 the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31
 2019
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February&#160;28
 2020
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. &#160;Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging
 subjective
 or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements
 taken as a whole
 and we are not
 by communicating the critical audit matter below
 providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
The Company&#8217;s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its bottlers/distributors and retail customers
 and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed-upon terms as well as the Company&#8217;s historical experience with similar programs and require management&#8217;s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to bottlers/distributors or retail customers
 including
 but not limited to
 the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers
 including slotting
 shelf space allowances
 and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising
 in-store marketing
 and promotional activities; (iv) agreed share of slotting
 shelf space allowances
 and other fees given directly to retailers
 club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to bottlers/distributors related to sales made by the Company directly to certain customers that fall within the bottlers&#8217;/distributors&#8217; sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to bottlers/distributors. The length of promotional programs can vary from as little as one day
 for one-time events
 to as long as one year based on the agreed-upon terms. The nature of such programs is determined on a per retail customer basis
 and in certain instances
 the same program is set for multiple retail customers. The promotional expenditures are recorded as a reduction to net sales in the period the underlying sale occurs. Total promotional expenditures included as a reduction to net sales were $666.9 million for the year ended December 31
 2019
 and accrued promotional allowances were $166.8 million as of December 31
Our audit procedures over accrued promotional allowances
 with respect to management&#8217;s judgment regarding levels of consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels and future promotional claims
 included the following
We tested the effectiveness of controls over accrued promotional allowances
We selected a sample of accrued promotional allowances recorded for specific distributors and retail customers and sent confirmation requests of the accrual recorded and key terms of the agreement directly to the distributor or retail customer. We compared the confirmation response to the accrued amount recorded by the Company. In instances of nonreplies to our confirmation request from the distributor or retail customer
 we performed alternative procedures as follows: (1) developing an expectation of the accrual using current-year claim and payment data
 and/or (2) vouching known claim submissions
 unpaid as of period-end
We tested the promotional expenditure amount recorded as a reduction to net sales and assessed the reasonableness of management&#8217;s estimate by developing an expectation of the amount
 based on historical promotional expenditure amounts recorded as a percentage of sales
We performed inquiries with the Company&#8217;s sales and marketing personnel to corroborate our understanding of new and existing promotional programs that may alter the relationship between gross sales and promotional allowances
 as such programs are considered by management when estimating future promotional claims.

 &#8211; Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 805 &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221;. &#160;FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer
 determine the acquisition date
 recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired
 the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity
&#8211; The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year
 &#8211; The Company&#8217;s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity
 available-for-sale or trading
 in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
 where available (See Note 5). 
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands
Under FASB ASC 320-10-35
 a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the &#8220;Credit Loss&#8221;) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis and the investor intends
 or will be required
 to sell the security before recovery of the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists
 the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security
 and will not be required to sell the security
 before recovery of the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss
 net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management
 and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held
 market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer&#8217;s financial condition and
 if applicable
 information on the guarantors&#8217; financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment&#8217;s fair value has been less than its cost basis
 the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors
The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer&#8217;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company&#8217;s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. &#160;In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45
 in its consolidated balance sheets
 the Company has presented accounts receivable

 &#8211; The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired
 including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis
 or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value
 the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value
 including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process
 performed only if a potential impairment exists
 involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit&#39;s net assets
 other than goodwill
 and the fair value

of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the years ended December 31

 as well as in a number of countries around the world. In accordance with FASB ASC 350
 intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually
 or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the years ended December 31
 2019
&#8211; Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets
 including certain definite-lived intangible assets
 for possible impairment. This review occurs annually
 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. &#160;If there is indication of impairment
 management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management&#8217;s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management&#8217;s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions.

 &#8211; The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in FASB ASC&#160;740. Under the liability method
 deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets
 an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded
 decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made.

 as part of its simplification initiative to reduce the cost and complexity in accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation
 the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU 2019-12 also amends other aspects of the guidance to help simplify and promote consistent application of GAAP. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04
 &#8220;Intangibles and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment&#8221;
 which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill
 but rather requires an entity to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value over its fair value. This amendment is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15

 2017
 to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into retained earnings. This amendment pertains only to those items impacted by the new tax law and does not apply to any future tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and allowed for early adoption. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-02 did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 &#8220;Leases (Topic 842)&#8221;. ASU No. 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The accounting for finance leases (capital leases) was substantially unchanged. The original guidance required application on a modified retrospective basis with adjustments to the earliest comparative period presented. In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11

FASB ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices
 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.

 &#8211; The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third-party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i)&#160;certain agreements with the Company&#8217;s officers
 directors and employees under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship
 (ii)&#160;certain distribution or purchase agreements under which the Company may have to indemnify the Company&#8217;s customers from any claim
 liability or loss arising out of any actual or alleged injury or damages suffered in connection with the consumption or purchase of the Company&#8217;s products or the use of Company trademarks
 and (iii)&#160;certain real estate leases

On December 22
 2017
 the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Reform Act. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by
 among other things
 lowering corporate income tax rates
% rate
 effective January 1
 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available
 prepared
 or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. A company may select between one of three scenarios to determine a reasonable estimate for certain income tax effects arising from the Tax Reform Act. Those scenarios are (i) a final estimate which effectively closes the measurement window; (ii) a reasonable estimate leaving the measurement window open for future revisions; and (iii) no estimate as the law is still being analyzed. The Company was able to provide a reasonable estimate for the revaluation of deferred taxes and the effects of the toll charge on undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits (&#8220;E&amp;P&#8221;). As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act
 the Company revalued its net deferred tax assets at December 31
 2017
 resulting in a provisional $39.8 million charge included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31
 2017. The Tax Reform Act also provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 E&amp;P through the year ended December 31
 2017. As a result
 million charge in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31
 2017 related to such deemed mandatory repatriation. The Company completed its analysis of the Tax Reform Act during 2018 and adjusted the 2017 provisional estimate to the final amounts in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. The measurement window begins in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained
 prepared and analyzed the information needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under ASC 740.  For the year ended December 31
 2018
The Company has not made additional measurement window adjustments to these items during the year ended December 31
The Company evaluated the various provisions of the Tax Reform Act
 including
The Company currently considers the earnings of its foreign entities (excluding Japan) to be permanently reinvested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Accordingly
 deferred income taxes have not been recorded for the undistributed earnings of the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries excluding Japan. Deferred income taxes have not been recorded for Japan
 as any federal
 state
 or foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of those earnings would be immaterial.
