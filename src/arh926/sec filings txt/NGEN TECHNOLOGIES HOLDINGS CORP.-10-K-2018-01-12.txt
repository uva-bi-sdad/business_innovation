 including our principal executive officer who also serves as our principal financial officer
 we conducted an evaluation as of September 30
 2017
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

 our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30
 2017.

 accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition




 there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk.&#160; In addition




 2017
 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 our management conducted an assessment
 including testing
 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework).&#160; A material weakness is a control deficiency
 or a combination of control deficiencies



Based on the evaluation performed


 management identified as materials weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: (1) the lack of accounting proficiency of our chief executive officer who is our sole officer and our principal accounting officer which has resulted in a reliance on part-time outside consultants to perform substantially all of our accounting functions
 (2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting process and accounting function
 and (3) lack of control procedures that include multiple levels of review
 also arising from our chief executive officer's lack of accounting training and service in multiple roles as well as our limited financial resources to support hiring of personnel and implementation of accounting systems.

Basis
of Accounting


on the accrual basis of accounting.&#160; The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on that basis
 in which revenues
and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred.




in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents


flows
 cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances
 which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties
 and
highly liquid investments and debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments


 including
cash
 other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities
 the
fair value of which
 based on management's estimates
 reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of our notes and
advances payable is based on management estimates and reasonably approximates their book value based on their current maturity.

Net
Loss per Common Share


accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 260
 Earnings per Share (EPS). ASC 260 requires presentation
of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.

Property
 Equipment
and Intangible Assets


less accumulated depreciation. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Intangible
assets consist of acquired customer and vendor databases and are carried at cost
 less accumulated amortization.


principally on the straight-line basis method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Stock-Based
Compensation


to employees and non-employees in accordance with ASC 718 requiring employee equity awards to be accounted for under the fair value
method. Accordingly
 share-based compensation is measured at grant date
 based on the fair value of the award and is recognized
as expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to other than employees
in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50. Equity instruments issued to other than employees are valued at the earlier of a commitment
date or upon completion of the services
 based on the fair value of the equity instruments and is recognized as expense over the
service period. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for common
stock options and the closing price of the company's common stock for common share issuances.




There was zero inventory in stock in September 30
 2017 and 2016 respectively.

Revenue
and Cost Recognition


from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC 605 &#34;Revenue Recognition&#34;. Four basic criteria
must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3)
the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4)
are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability
of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated returns and allowances
 and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product was not
delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been
delivered or no refund will be required.

Income
Taxes


Taxes&#34; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method
 deferred income taxes are recognized for
the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Temporary differences between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes and income
tax purposes primarily relate to the recognition of debt costs and stock based compensation expense. The adoption of ASC 740-10
did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

As defined in (Financial Accounting Standards
Board ASC 820)
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of similar entities in its
industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk
and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
 or
generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820 establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (level 3 measurement).





    
Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities and listed equities.




    
Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
 as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.




    
    



the conversion value is equal or less than par value of the shares used for conversion thus determining&#160;&#160; that the fair
value of the notes is equal to their face value.




































The entire disclosure for the fair value of financial instruments (as defined)
 including financial assets and financial liabilities (collectively
 as defined)
 and the measurements of those instruments as well as disclosures related to the fair value of non-financial assets and liabilities. Such disclosures about the financial instruments
 assets
 and liabilities would include: (1) the fair value of the required items together with their carrying amounts (as appropriate); (2) for items for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value
 disclosure would include: (a) information pertinent to estimating fair value (including
 carrying amount
 effective interest rate
 and maturity
 and (b) the reasons why it is not practicable to estimate fair value; (3) significant concentrations of credit risk including: (a) information about the activity
 region
 or economic characteristics identifying a concentration
 (b) the maximum amount of loss the entity is exposed to based on the gross fair value of the related item
 (c) policy for requiring collateral or other security and information as to accessing such collateral or security
 and (d) the nature and brief description of such collateral or security; (4) quantitative information about market risks and how such risks are managed; (5) for items measured on both a recurring and nonrecurring basis information regarding the inputs used to develop the fair value measurement; and (6) for items presented in the financial statement for which fair value measurement is elected: (a) information necessary to understand the reasons for the election
 (b) discussion of the effect of fair value changes on earnings
 (c) a description of [similar groups] items for which the election is made and the relation thereof to the balance sheet
 the aggregate carrying value of items included in the balance sheet that are not eligible for the election; (7) all other required (as defined) and desired information.

The Company maintains its books and records
on the accrual basis of accounting.&#160; The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on that basis
 in which revenues
and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred.





The presentation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Actual
results could differ from those estimates.




For the purpose of the statement of cash
flows
 cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances
 which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties
 and
highly liquid investments and debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.





Our short-term financial instruments
 including
cash
 other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities
 the
fair value of which
 based on management's estimates
 reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of our notes and
advances payable is based on management estimates and reasonably approximates their book value based on their current maturity.





The Company computes per share amounts in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 260
 Earnings per Share (EPS). ASC 260 requires presentation
of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.




PROPERTY
 EQUIPMENT
 AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Property and equipment are carried at cost
less accumulated depreciation. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Intangible
assets consist of acquired customer and vendor databases and are carried at cost
 less accumulated amortization.


principally on the straight-line basis method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.





The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
to employees and non-employees in accordance with ASC 718 requiring employee equity awards to be accounted for under the fair value
method. Accordingly
 share-based compensation is measured at grant date
 based on the fair value of the award and is recognized
as expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to other than employees
in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50. Equity instruments issued to other than employees are valued at the earlier of a commitment
date or upon completion of the services
 based on the fair value of the equity instruments and is recognized as expense over the
service period. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for common
stock options and the closing price of the company's common stock for common share issuances.





Inventories are stated at the cost of goods.
There was zero inventory in stock in September 30
 2017 and 2016 respectively.




It is the Company's policy that revenue
from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC 605 &#34;Revenue Recognition&#34;. Four basic criteria
must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3)
the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4)
are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability
of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated returns and allowances
 and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product was not
delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been
delivered or no refund will be required.





The Company utilizes ASC 740 &#34;Income
Taxes&#34; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method
 deferred income taxes are recognized for
the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Temporary differences between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes and income
tax purposes primarily relate to the recognition of debt costs and stock based compensation expense. The adoption of ASC 740-10
did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.
