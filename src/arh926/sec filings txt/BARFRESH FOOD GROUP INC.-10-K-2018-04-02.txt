Business
Overview

Barfresh
is a leader in the creation
 manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products
includes smoothies
 shakes and frappes. Products are packaged in two distinct formats. The Company&rsquo;s original single serve
format features portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or &ldquo;beverage packs&rdquo;. The beverage
packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 including the base (either sorbet
 frozen yogurt or
ice cream)
 real fruit pieces
 juices and ice &ndash; five ounces of water are added before blending. The Company&rsquo;s bulk
&ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 packaged in gallon containers
in a concentrated formula that is mixed &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; with water. The Company has recently launched a &ldquo;no sugar
added&rdquo; version of the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format that is specifically targeted for the USDA national school meal
program
 including the School Breakfast Program
 the National School Lunch Program
 and Smart Snacks in Schools Program.

Domestic
and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh
 as well as related trademarks for all of the single serve
products. Patent rights have been granted in 13 jurisdictions including the United States. In addition
 the Company has purchased
all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

The
Company conducts sales through several channels
 including National Accounts
 Regional Accounts
 and Broadline Distributors. Barfresh&rsquo;s
primary broadline distribution arrangement is through an exclusive nationwide agreement with Sysco Corporation (&ldquo;Sysco&rdquo;)
the U.S.&rsquo;s largest broadline distributor
 which was entered into during July 2014
 and renewed for an additional two year
term on October 2
 2017.

During
2016 and 2017 the Company announced that it had signed supply agreements with several of the major global on-site foodservice
operators. On March 8
 2018
 the Company announced that it had signed a new supply agreement with one of the largest of these
foodservice operators
 for exclusive distribution of four of Barfresh&rsquo;s single serve sku&rsquo;s to approximately one thousand
food service locations. Distribution of product to these locations through SYSCO will begin during April of 2018. This new agreement
 marks the culmination of successful in market tests conducted at several locations
 and makes Barfresh&rsquo;s blended beverages
available across many of the most attractive locations of the customer&rsquo;s diverse customer base.

The
Company also sells to broadline distributors that supply products to the food services market place. Effective July 2
 2014
 the
Company entered into an exclusive agreement with Sysco Merchandising and Supply Chain Services
 Inc. for resale by the Sysco Corporation
(&ldquo;Sysco&rdquo;) to the foodservice industry of the Company&rsquo;s ready-to-blend smoothies
 shakes and frappes. Pursuant
to that agreement
 all Barfresh products are included in Sysco&rsquo;s national core selection of beverage items
 making Barfresh
its exclusive single-serve
 pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive; however
 Barfresh may also sell
the products to other foodservice distributors
 but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to service multi-unit
chain operators with at least 20 units and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator&rsquo;s nominated distributor for
our products. On October 2
 2017
 the Sysco agreement was extended for an additional two year period
 and expanded to cover bulk
easy pour products
 on a non-exclusive basis.

On
October 26
 2015
 Barfresh signed a five year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages
 a division of PepsiCo
 to become
its exclusive sales representative within the food service channel to present Barfresh&rsquo;s line of ready-to-blend smoothies
and frozen beverages throughout the United States and Canada. Through this agreement
 Barfresh&rsquo; products are included as
part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s offerings to its significant customer base. The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer
accounts
 through introductions provided by PepsiCo&rsquo;s one-thousand plus person foodservice sales team. Barfresh products
have become part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.


    
    



Barfresh
utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of its products in the United States. Production lines are currently
operational at two locations. The first location is in Salt Lake City
 which currently produces both bulk easy pour and single
serve products. Annual production capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is
with Yarnell Operations
 LLC.
 a subsidiary of Shulze and Burch
 located in Arkansas. The Yarnell&rsquo;s agreement
 which was
signed during February
 2016
 and secures the capacity to ramp up to an incremental production capacity of 100 million units.
Yarnell&rsquo;s location enhances the company&rsquo;s ability to efficiently move product throughout the supply chain to destinations
in the eastern United States
 home to many of the country&rsquo;s large foodservice outlets.

Corporate
History and Background

The
Company
 which was incorporated in Delaware on February 25
 2010
 was originally formed to produce movies. As the result of the
reverse merger
 more fully described below
 the Company is now engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend
beverages
 particularly
 smoothies
 shakes and frappes.

Reorganization
and Recapitalization

During
January
 2012
 the Company entered into a series of transactions pursuant to which Barfresh Inc.
 a Colorado corporation (&ldquo;Barfresh
NV&rdquo;)
 was acquired
 spun-out prior operations to the former principal shareholder
 completed a private offering of securities
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $999
998
 conducted a four for one forward stock split and changed the name of
the Company. The following describes the steps of this reorganization:



    
    
Acquisition
    of Barfresh NV. 
333
328
    shares of our $0.000001 par value common stock pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between us
 our former principal shareholder
    Barfresh NV and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV. As a result of this transaction
 Barfresh NV became our wholly owned
    subsidiary and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV became our controlling shareholders.

    
    
    

    
    
Spinout
    of prior business. 
 we spun-out our previous business operations to
    a former officer
 director and principal shareholder
 in exchange for all of the shares of our common stock held by that person.
    Such shares were cancelled immediately following the acquisition.

    
    
    

    
    
Financing
    transaction
 we sold an aggregate of 1
333
332 shares of our common
    stock and five-year warrants to purchase 1
333
332 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $1.50 in a private
    offering for gross proceeds of $999
998
 less expenses of $26
895.

    
    
    

    
    
Change
    of name
 we changed the name of the Company from Moving Box Inc. to Barfresh Food Group Inc.

    
    
    

    
    
Forward
    stock split
 we conducted a four for one forward stock split of the Company&rsquo;s common stock.




The
Company&rsquo;s products are made in two formats. The first is in portion controlled single serving beverage ingredient packs
suitable for smoothies
 shakes and frappes that can also be utilized for cocktails and mocktails. These packs contain all
of the ingredients necessary to make a smoothie
 shake or frappe
 including the ice. Simply add water
 empty the packet into a
blender
 blend and serve. The second format is the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format. The Company&rsquo;s bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo;
format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated
formula that is mixed &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; with water.



    
    






    
    


The
following flavors are available as part of our standard portfolio of single serve products:




Some
of the key benefits of the products for the end consumers that drink the products include:



    
    
From
    as little as 150 calories (per serving)

    
    
    

    
    
Real
    fruit in every smoothie

    
    
    

    
    
Dairy
    free options

    
    
    

    
    
Kosher
    approved

    
    
    

    
    
Gluten
    Free



    
    



Customer
Marketing Material

A
wide range of consumer marketing materials has been created to assist customers in selling blended beverages.



Research
and Development

The
Company incurred research and development expenses for the year ended December 31
 2017 in the amount of $574
989 and for the
year ended December 31
 2016 in the amount of $432
146. The increase in Research and Development expenses was primarily attributable
to commissioning of new production lines at our contract manufacturer facilities
 and increased activity in creating unique flavors
for potential customers in our national account pipeline.



There
is significant competition in the smoothie market at both the consumer purchasing level and also the product level.


    
    



The
competition at the consumer level is primarily between specialized juice bars (e.g. Jamba Juice) and major fast casual and fast
food restaurant chains (such as McDonalds). Barfresh does not compete specifically at this level but intends to supply its product
to customers that fall within these segments to enable them to compete for consumer demand.

There
may also be new entrants to the smoothie market that may alter the current competitor landscape.
The
existing competition from a product perspective can be separated into three categories:

&#9679;
Specialized juice bar products: The product is made in-store and each ingredient is added separately.

&#9679;
Syrup based products: The fruit puree is supplied in bulk and not portion controlled for each smoothie. These types of products
still require the addition of juice
 milk or water and/or yogurt and ice. While there are a number of competitors for this style
of product
 the two dominant competitors are Island Oasis and Minute Maid.

&#9679;
Portion pack products: These products contain only the fruit and yogurt and require the addition of juice or milk and ice. The
two dominant competitors are General Mills&rsquo; Yoplait Smoothies and Inventure Group&rsquo;s Jamba Smoothies.

The
Company believes that its single serve products afford a very significant competitive advantage based on ease of use
 portion
control
 premium quality
 and minimal capital investment required to enable a customer to begin to carry Barfresh beverage products.
The Company also believes that its bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; product represents an attractive alternative delivery method for
customers that serve high volume locations
 where speed of service over extended periods is a critical requirement. The Company
has recently launched a &ldquo;no sugar added&rdquo; version of the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format that is specifically targeted
for the USDA national school meal program
 including the School Breakfast Program
 the National School Lunch Program
 and Smart
Snacks in Schools Program.

Intellectual
Property

Barfresh
owns the domestic and intellectual property rights to its products&rsquo; sealed pack of ingredients used in its single serve
products.

In
November 2011
 the Company acquired patent applications filed in the United States (Patent Application number 11/660415) and Canada
(Patent Application number 2577163) from certain related parties. The United States patent was originally filed on December 4
2007 and it was granted during August of 2017. The Canadian patent was originally filed on August 16
 2005 and it was granted
on May 27
 2014.

On
October 15
 2013
 the Company acquired all of the related international patent rights
 which were filed pursuant to the Patent
Cooperation Treaty
 have been granted in 13 jurisdictions and are pending in the remainder of the jurisdictions that have signed
the PCT. In addition
 the Company purchased all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

Governmental
Approval and Regulation

The
Company is not aware of the need for any governmental approvals of its products.

The
Company utilizes contract manufacturers. Before entering into any manufacturing contracts
 the Company determines that the manufacturer
meets all government requirements.


    
    



Environmental
Laws

The
Company does not believe that it will be subject to any environmental laws
 either state or federal. Any laws concerning manufacturing
will be the responsibility of the contract manufacturer.



The
Company currently has 30 employees and 3 consultants. There are currently 20 employees and 1 consultant selling our products.
We have recently restructured our sales force
 eliminating 18 full time positions over a twelve month period
 while at the same
time expanding our brokerage network.

Research
and Development

The
Company incurred research and development expenses for the year ended December 31
 2017
 in the amount of $574
989
 and for the
year ended December 31
 2016 in the amount of $432
146. The increase in Research and Development expenses was primarily attributable
to commissioning of new production lines at our contract manufacturer facilities
 and increased activity in creating unique flavors
for potential customers in our national account pipeline.

Item
1A. Risk Factors

An
investment in the Company&rsquo;s securities involves significant risks
 including the risks described below. The risks included
below are not the only ones that the Company faces. Additional risks presently unknown to us or that we currently consider immaterial
or unlikely to occur could also impair our operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any such additional
risks and uncertainties actually occur
 our business
 prospects
 financial condition or results of operations could be negatively
affected.

Risks
Related to Our Business

We
have a history of operating losses

We
have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability. These operating losses have been generated while
we market to potential customers. We cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability
 given
the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate
 we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability
and our failure to do so would adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s business
 including our ability to raise additional funds.

A
worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in consumer spending may adversely impact our ability to implement our business
strategy.

Our
success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending
 which is influenced by general economic conditions
and the availability of discretionary income. There is no certainty regarding economic conditions in the United States
 and credit
and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions could deteriorate at any time. Accordingly
 we may experience declines
in revenue during economic turmoil or during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending
leading cost-conscious consumers to be more selective in restaurants visited
 could have a material adverse effect on our revenue
results of operations
 business and financial condition.


    
    



The
challenges of competing with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins.

We
compete with many well-established companies
 food service and otherwise
 on the basis of taste
 quality and price of product
offered
 customer service
 atmosphere
 location and overall guest experience. Our success depends
 in part
 upon the popularity
of our products and our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all four day parts. Shifts in consumer
preferences away from our products
 our inability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all day parts
 or
changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business. We compete with other smoothie and
juice bar retailers
 specialty coffee retailers
 yogurt and ice cream shops
 bagel shops
 fast-food restaurants
 delicatessens
caf&eacute;s
 take-out food service companies
 supermarkets and convenience stores. Our competitors change with each of the four
day parts
 ranging from coffee bars and bakery caf&eacute;s to casual dining chains. Many of our competitors or potential competitors
have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do
 which may allow them to react to changes in the market quicker
than we can. In addition
 aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets
 could reduce
our revenue and operating margins. We also compete with other employers in our markets for workers and may become subject to higher
labor costs as a result of such competition.

Fluctuations
in various food and supply costs
 particularly fruit and dairy
 could adversely affect our operating results.

Supplies
and prices of the various ingredients that we are going to use to can be affected by a variety of factors
 such as weather
 seasonal
fluctuations
 demand
 politics and economics in the producing countries.

These
factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies
 which could adversely affect our revenue and profits. In
addition
 the prices of fruit and dairy
 which are the main ingredients in our products
 can be highly volatile. The fruit of
the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis
 depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An increase
in pricing of any fruit that we are going to use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure our fruit supply.

Our
business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management and other key personnel
 and our business may
be severely disrupted if we lose their services.

Our
future success heavily depends on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. If one or more of our
senior executives is unable or unwilling to continue to work for us in his present position
 we may have to spend a considerable
amount of time and resources searching
 recruiting
 and integrating a replacement into our operations
 which would substantially
divert management&rsquo;s attention from our business and severely disrupt our business. This may also adversely affect our ability
to execute our business strategy.

Our
senior management&rsquo;s limited experience managing a publicly traded company may divert management&rsquo;s attention from operations
and harm our business.

With
the exception of our Chief Financial Officer
 our senior management team has relatively limited experience managing a publicly
traded company and complying with federal securities laws
 including compliance with recently adopted disclosure requirements
on a timely basis. Our management will be required to design and implement appropriate programs and policies in responding to
increased legal
 regulatory compliance and reporting requirements
 and any failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines
and penalties and harm our business.

We
may be unable to attract and retain qualified
 experienced
 highly skilled personnel
 which could adversely affect the implementation
of our business plan.

Our
success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract
 retain and motivate skilled and qualified personnel. As we
become a more mature company in the future
 we may find recruiting and retention efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed
in attracting
 hiring and integrating excellent personnel
 or retaining and motivating existing personnel
 we may be unable to
grow effectively. The loss of any key employee
 including members of our senior management team
 and our inability to attract
highly skilled personnel with sufficient experience in our industries could harm our business.


    
    



Product
liability exposure may expose us to significant liability.

We
may face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and other claims and lawsuits in the event that the development
or use of our technology or prospective products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects. We may not be able to avoid significant
liability exposure. Although we believe our insurance coverage to be adequate
 we may not have sufficient insurance coverage
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost. An inability to obtain product liability insurance
at acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization
of our products. A product liability claim could hurt our financial performance. Even if we ultimately avoid financial liability
for this type of exposure
 we may incur significant costs in defending ourselves that could hurt our financial performance and
condition.

Our
inability to protect our intellectual property rights may force us to incur unanticipated costs.

Our
success will depend
 in part
 on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and internationally for certain
intellectual property incorporated into our products. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged
 narrowed
 invalidated
or circumvented
 which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing similar solutions that limit the effectiveness
of our patent protection and force us to incur unanticipated costs. In addition
 existing laws of some countries in which we may
provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights.

Our
products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties
 and third parties may infringe our proprietary rights
either of which may result in lawsuits
 distraction of management and the impairment of our business.

As
the number of patents
 copyrights
 trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases
 products based
on our technology may increasingly become the subject of infringement claims. Third parties could assert infringement claims against
us in the future. Infringement claims with or without merit could be time consuming
 result in costly litigation
 cause product
shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements
 if required
 might
not be available on terms acceptable to us
 or at all. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement
of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Litigation to determine the validity of any
claims
 whether or not the litigation is resolved in our favor
 could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts
of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks. If there is an adverse ruling against us in any litigation
 we
may be required to pay substantial damages
 discontinue the use and sale of infringing products and expend significant resources
to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology. Our failure to develop or license a substitute
technology could prevent us from selling our products.

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research
 or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research
 about our business
 our
share price and trading volume could decline.

The
trading market for our common stock may be impacted
 in part
 by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts
publish about our business or us. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us
 continue to cover us or provide favorable
coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock
 our share price may decline. In addition
if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us
 we could lose visibility in
the financial markets
 which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.

We
will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company
 and our management will be required to devote
substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.

As
a public company
 we will continue to incur significant legal
 accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various
requirements on public companies
 including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate
governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these
compliance initiatives. Moreover
 these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make
some activities more time-consuming and costly.

We
cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to continue to operate as a public company
 nor can we
predict the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations
 in many cases due
to their lack of specificity
 and
 as a result
 their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided
by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs
necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.


    
    



We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system
of internal control over financial reporting
 we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.

Pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 or Section 404
 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our
internal control over financial reporting. As such
 our management has conducted this evaluation and
 as of December 31
 2017
identified the following material weakness in the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting:



    
    
Inadequate
    Segregation of Duties: We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement certain control procedures related
    to segregation of duties.


Management
has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. Effective internal control over financial reporting
is necessary to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports
or prevent fraud
 our operating results could be harmed. We will need to continue to dedicate internal resources
 potentially
engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to modify and document the adequacy of internal control over financial
reporting
 continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate
 validate through testing that controls are functioning
as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Continued
identification of one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in an adverse
reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.

Failure
to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.

As
a Delaware corporation
 we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 which generally prohibits United States
companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business. Some foreign companies
 including some that may compete with our Company
 may not be subject to these prohibitions.
Corruption
 extortion
 bribery
 pay-offs
 theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in countries in which
we conduct our business. However
 our employees or other agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.
If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices
 we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences
that may have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB
 which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB
 which is a significantly more limited trading market than the New York Stock Exchange
 or
the NASDAQ Stock Market. The quotation of the Company&rsquo;s shares on the OTCQB may result in a less liquid market available
for existing and potential shareholders to trade shares of our common stock
 could depress the trading price of our common stock
and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.

There
is limited liquidity on the OTCQB
 which may result in stock price volatility and inaccurate quote information.

When
fewer shares of a security are being traded on the OTCQB
 volatility of prices may increase and price movement may outpace the
ability to deliver accurate quote information. Due to lower trading volumes in shares of our common stock
 there may be a lower
likelihood of one&rsquo;s orders for shares of our common stock being executed
 and current prices may differ significantly from
the price one was quoted at the time of one&rsquo;s order entry.


    
    



If
we are unable to adequately fund our operations
 we may be forced to voluntarily file for deregistration of our common stock with
the SEC.

Compliance
with the periodic reporting requirements required by the SEC consumes a considerable amount of both internal
 as well external
resources and represents a significant cost for us. If we are unable to continue to devote adequate funding and the resources
needed to maintain such compliance
 while continuing our operations
 we could be forced to deregister with the SEC. After the
deregistration process
 our common stock would only be tradable on the &ldquo;Pink Sheets&rdquo; and could suffer a decrease in
or absence of liquidity.

Because
we became public by means of a &ldquo;reverse merger&rdquo;
 we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.

Additional
risks may exist since we became public through a &ldquo;reverse merger&rdquo;. Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may
not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. We
cannot assure you that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our Company in the future.

Future
sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise funds
in future securities offerings.

Future
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market
 or the perception that such sales may occur
could adversely affect the then prevailing market price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise funds
in the future through a public offering of our securities.

Our
common stock is thinly traded
 so you may be unable to sell at or near asking prices or at all if you need to sell your shares
to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.

Currently
the Company&rsquo;s common stock is quoted in the OTCQB and future trading volume may be limited by the fact that many major institutional
investment funds
 including mutual funds
 as well as individual investors follow a policy of not investing in OTCQB stocks and
certain major brokerage firms restrict their brokers from recommending OTCQB stocks because they are considered speculative
 volatile
and thinly traded. The OTCQB market is an inter-dealer market much less regulated than the major exchanges and our common stock
is subject to abuses
 volatility and shorting. Thus
 there is currently no broadly followed and established trading market for
the Company&rsquo;s common stock. An established trading market may never develop or be maintained. Active trading markets generally
result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders. Absence of an active trading market reduces
the liquidity of the shares traded there.

The
trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be limited and sporadic. As a result of such trading activity
the quoted price for the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the OTCQB may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of its fair market
value. Further
 if we cease to be quoted
 holders would find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock or to obtain accurate
quotations as to the market value of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and as a result
 the market value of our common stock likely
would decline.

Our
common stock is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.

The
market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors
 including market perception of our
ability to achieve our planned growth
 quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry
 trading volume in
our common stock
 changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting the Company&rsquo;s
competitors or the Company itself. In addition
 the OTCQB is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations in general. This
volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their
operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.


    
    



We
are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.

Our
common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB. Our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15(g)-9
 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act as long as the price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share. Under such rule
 broker-dealers
who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special
sales practice requirements
 including a requirement that they make an individualized written suitability determination for the
purchaser and receive the purchaser&rsquo;s consent prior to the transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock
Reform Act of 1990
 also requires additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock.
Generally
 the Commission defines a penny stock as any equity security not traded on a national exchange that has a market price
of less than $5.00 per share. The required penny stock disclosures include the delivery
 prior to any transaction
 of a disclosure
schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with it. Such requirements could severely limit the market
liquidity of the securities and the ability of purchasers to sell their securities in the secondary market.

Because
we do not intend to pay dividends
 shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in
value.

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our preferred stock or common stock. For the foreseeable future
 it is expected
that earnings
 if any
 generated from our operations will be used to finance the growth of our business
 and that no dividends
will be paid to holders of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. As a result
 the success of an investment in our common stock will
depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There can be no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.

The
price of our common stock may become volatile
 which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.

The
trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:



    
    
actual
    or anticipated variations in our operating results;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    of developments by us or our competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions
 strategic partnerships
 joint ventures or capital commitments;

    
    
    

    
    
adoption
    of new accounting standards affecting the our industry;

    
    
    

    
    
additions
    or departures of key personnel;

    
    
    

    
    
introduction
    of new products by us or our competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
sales
    of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and

    
    
    

    
    
other
    events or factors
 many of which are beyond our control.


The
stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past
 following periods of volatility in the market
price of a company&rsquo;s securities
 securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation
initiated against us
 whether or not successful
 could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management&rsquo;s attention
and Company resources
 which could harm our business and financial condition.

Investors
may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.

We
intend to continue to seek financing through the issuance of equity or convertible securities to fund our operations. In the future
we may also issue additional equity securities resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders.
We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common
stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees
 future acquisitions or for other business purposes. The future issuance
of any such additional shares of common stock will result in dilution to our shareholders and may create downward pressure on
the trading price of our common stock.


    
    



Provisions
in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company
 which may be beneficial to
our stockholders
 more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.

Provisions
in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage
 delay or prevent a merger
 acquisition or other change in control
of our company that stockholders may consider favorable
 including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium
for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of
our common stock
 thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition
 because our board of directors is responsible
for appointing the members of our management team
 these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders
to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors.
In addition
 because we are incorporated in Delaware
 we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law
 which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining
with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding
voting stock
 unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.

Item
7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The
information and financial data discussed below is derived from the audited financial statements of Barfresh for its fiscal year
ended December 31
 2017 and for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016. The financial statements of Barfresh were prepared and
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The information and financial data
discussed below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes
of Barfresh contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements based
on assumptions about our future business. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors. See &ldquo;Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements&rdquo; above for a
discussion of forward-looking statements and the significance of such statements in the context of this Annual Report.

&nbsp;Barfresh
is a leader in the creation
 manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products
includes smoothies
 shakes and frappes. Products are packaged in two distinct formats. The Company&rsquo;s original single serve
format features portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or &ldquo;beverage packs&rdquo;. The beverage
packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 including the base (either sorbet
 frozen yogurt or
ice cream)
 real fruit pieces
 juices and ice &ndash; five ounces of water are added before blending. The Company&rsquo;s bulk
&ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 packaged in gallon containers
in a concentrated formula that is mixed &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; with water. The Company has recently launched a &ldquo;no sugar
added&rdquo; version of the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format that is specifically targeted for the USDA national school meal
program
 including the School Breakfast Program
 the National School Lunch Program
 and Smart Snacks in Schools Program.

Domestic
and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh
 as well as related trademarks for all of the single serve
products. Patent rights have been granted in 13 jurisdictions including the United States. In addition
 the Company has purchased
all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

The
Company conducts sales through several channels
 including National Accounts
 Regional Accounts
 and Broadline Distributors. Barfresh&rsquo;s
primary broadline distribution arrangement is through an exclusive nationwide agreement with Sysco Corporation (&ldquo;Sysco&rdquo;)
the U.S.&rsquo;s largest broadline distributor
 which was entered into during July 2014
 and renewed for an additional two year
term on October 2
 2017.

During
2016 and 2017 the Company announced that it had signed supply agreements with several of the major global on-site foodservice
operators. On March 8
 2018
 the Company announced that it had signed a new supply agreement with one of the largest of these
foodservice operators
 for exclusive distribution of four of Barfresh&rsquo;s single serve sku&rsquo;s to approximately one thousand
food service locations. Distribution of product to these locations through SYSCO will begin during April of 2018. This new agreement marks the culmination of successful in market tests conducted at several locations
 and makes Barfresh&rsquo;s blended beverages
available across many of the most attractive locations of the customer&rsquo;s diverse customer base.


    
    



The
Company also sells to broadline distributors that supply products to the food services market place. Effective July 2
 2014
 the
Company entered into an exclusive agreement with Sysco Merchandising and Supply Chain Services
 Inc. for resale by the Sysco Corporation
(&ldquo;Sysco&rdquo;) to the foodservice industry of the Company&rsquo;s ready-to-blend smoothies
 shakes and frappes. Pursuant
to that agreement
 all Barfresh products are included in Sysco&rsquo;s national core selection of beverage items
 making Barfresh
its exclusive single-serve
 pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive; however
 Barfresh may also sell
the products to other foodservice distributors
 but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to service multi-unit
chain operators with at least 20 units and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator&rsquo;s nominated distributor for
our products. On October 2
 2017
 the Sysco agreement was extended for an additional two year period
 and expanded to cover bulk
easy pour products
 on a non-exclusive basis.

On
October 26
 2015
 Barfresh signed a five year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages
 a division of PepsiCo
 to become
its exclusive sales representative within the food service channel to present Barfresh&rsquo;s line of ready-to-blend smoothies
and frozen beverages throughout the United States and Canada. Through this agreement
 Barfresh&rsquo; products are included as
part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s offerings to its significant customer base. The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer
accounts
 through introductions provided by PepsiCo&rsquo;s one-thousand plus person foodservice sales team. Barfresh products
have become part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.

Barfresh
utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the products in the United States. Production lines are currently operational
at two locations. The first location is in Salt Lake City
 which currently produces both bulk easy pour and single serve products.
Annual production capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is with Yarnell Operations
LLC.
 a subsidiary of Shulze and Burch
 located in Arkansas. The Yarnell&rsquo;s agreement
 which was signed during February
2016
 and secures the capacity to ramp up to an incremental production capacity of 100 million units. Yarnell&rsquo;s location
enhances the company&rsquo;s ability to efficiently move product throughout the supply chain to destinations in the eastern United
States
 home to many of the country&rsquo;s large foodservice outlets.

The
Company currently has 30 employees and 3 consultants. There are currently 20 employees and 1 consultant selling our products.
We have recently restructured our sales force
 eliminating 18 full time positions over a twelve month period
 while at the same
time expanding our brokerage network.

Critical
Accounting Policies

Our
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).

Revenue
Recognition

We
recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement
 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered
 the
sales price is determinable
 and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is recorded net of provisions for discounts and promotion
allowances. Our products are sold on various terms. Our credit terms
 which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices
 typically require payment within 30 days of delivery. We recognize revenue upon receipt of our products by our distributors
and retail accounts
 in accordance with written sales terms
 net of provisions for discounts or allowances. Allowances for returns
and discounts are made on a case-by-case basis. Historically
 neither returns nor discounts have been material.

Share-based
Compensation

We
account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance
with applicable accounting standards
 which require all share-based payments to employees
 including grants of stock options and
restricted stock units (RSUs)
 to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards

Revenue
and Cost of Revenue

Revenue
for 2017 was $1
997
012 as compared to $1
457
499 in 2016
 an increase of 37%. Our business grew through the continuing expansion
of our business relationship with Sysco Corporation (&ldquo;Sysco&rdquo;)
 a major broad line food distributor. We began shipping
to Sysco in July 2014
 and by early 2016 had our products in all 72 of Sysco&rsquo;s Operating Companies. Our business also grew
as a result of the introduction of our Bulk Easy Pour product during early 2017.

Cost
of revenue for 2017 was $1
085
575 as compared to $772
827 in 2016. Our gross profit was $911
437 or 46%
 for 2017 and $684
672
or 47% for 2016. We anticipate that our gross profit percentage will improve in the future
 as our business gains scale and as
we expand our manufacturing operations.

Operating
Expenses

Our
operations during 2017 were directed towards increasing sales and creating and finalizing customized flavors for potential customers.
The increase in our business relationship with Sysco
 and the expansion of our product offerings to include Bulk Easy Pour
 drove
an increase in our selling
 marketing
 and general and administrative expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2016
 and during
the fourth quarter of 2017
 we re-aligned our sales force to a more efficient model
 by increasing the number of dedicated sales
brokers that represent our products
 and reducing the number of sales force employees.

Primarily
as a result of re-aligning our sales force
 general and administrative expenses decreased from $10
415
933 in 2016 to $9
492
094
in 2017
 a decrease of $923
839
 or 9%.

Following
is a breakdown of our selling
 marketing and general and administrative expenses for 2017 and 2016.

Personnel
cost represents the cost of employees including salaries
 employee benefits
 car allowances
 and employment taxes
 and continues
to be our largest expense. Personnel costs decreased 23%
 or $1
299
556
 from $5
560
502 in 2016 to $4
260
946 in 2017. During
the fourth quarters of 2016 and  2017
 we re-aligned our sales force to a more efficient model
 by increasing
the number of dedicated sales brokers that represent our products
 and reducing the number of sales force employees. When taking
into consideration start dates for new employees
 and separation dates for those employees who left our workforce
 we had 43 full
time equivalent employees during 2016. At December 31
 2017
 we had 30 full time employees
 as compared to 34 at December 31
2016. We do not anticipate any significant change in personnel during 2018.


    
    



Stock
based compensation is used as an incentive to attract new employees and to compensate and retain existing employees. Stock based
compensation includes stock issued and stock options granted to employees and certain non-employees
 increased $227
539 (20%)
from $1
133
149 in 2016 to $1
360


amortized over applicable vesting periods. We anticipate making additional grants in the future.

Legal
and professional fees
 which include accounting and legal services
 increased $39
956 (9%) from $425
781 in 2016 to $465
737 in
2017. We anticipate legal fees related to ongoing legal compliance to remain comparable in 2018.

Travel
and entertainment expenses decreased $183
636 (30%) from $605
920 in 2016 to $422
284 in 2017. The decrease is due to the re-alignment
of our sales force and the related decrease in the number of personnel traveling on company business.

Rent
expense increased $46
421 from $96
151 in 2016 to $142
572 in 2017. Rent expense is primarily incurred for our Headquarters location
in Beverly Hills
 California. During September of 2016 we relocated our Headquarters location to larger sub-leased premises in
Beverly Hills
 where the monthly rent of $10
997
 increased to $11
327 on November 1
 2017. We have entered into
a direct lease on the same premises beginning on March 1
 2018
 expiring March 31
 2019
 at a monthly rent of $14
488.

Marketing
and selling expenses decreased $33
889 (5%)
 from $730
142 in 2016
 to $696
253 in 2017. Lower marketing and selling expenses
were primarily due to lower personnel expense and lower sample expense.

Consulting
fees decreased from $242
668 in 2016 to $203
721 in 2017
 a decrease of $38
947 or 16%. We anticipate consulting costs to continue
to decline during 2018.

Director
fees for 2017 were $206
296 as compared with $165
227 in 2016. The increase is primarily due to the full year effect of an increase
of the number of our directors during the second half of 2016. We currently pay our non-employee directors $50
000 per year. These
fees can either be paid in cash
 or in stock or stock options
 at the election of the director.

The
Company incurred research and development expenses for the year ended December 31
 2017
 in the amount of $574
989 and for
the year ended December 31
 2016 in the amount of $432
146. During the quarter ended September 30
 2016
 we re-classified
certain personnel expenses that had previously been included in personnel expense
 to Research and Development. These
expenses relate primarily to the services performed by our Director of Manufacturing and Product Development
 and supporting
consultant expenses. The re-classification is shown in both the current period and the prior period. The increase in Research
and Development expenses was primarily attributable to increased activity in creating unique flavors for potential customers
in our national account pipeline. We anticipate this cost continuing in future periods
 at an increased rate as compared with
2017.

Shipping
and storage expense increased $212
624 (52%)
 from $407
247 in 2016 to $619
871 in 2017. Shipping and storage expense as a percentage
of revenue increased from 28% in 2016 to 31% in 2017. The higher expense in 2017 is due to a number of factors
 including the
continued movement of inventory to new forward warehouse as the company expanded its business into Canada
 and building of inventory
levels in preparation for expected national account launch in early 2018.

Other
expenses consist of ordinary operating expenses such as office
 telephone
 insurance
 and other similar expenses. These expenses
directly correlate to our overall business activity. We expect these expenses to continue to increase during 2018 as our business
grows.

Operating
loss was $8
911
540 in 2017
 and $9
939
875 in 2016.


    
    



Interest
expense was zero in 2017
 as compared with $250
850 in 2016. Interest expense for 2016 relates to $2
670
000 of convertible debt
that was issued during September of 2015
 the majority of which was converted to equity during the first quarter of 2016. The
stated interest rate on the convertible debt issued during September of 2015 was 10%.

Net
loss was $8
911
540 in 2017
 and $10
190
725 in 2016.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of December 31
 2017
 we had a working capital surplus of $1
774
719
 as compared with a working capital surplus of $8
751
702
at December 31
 2016. The reduction in working capital surplus is primarily due to the reduction in cash raised from investing
activities
 partially offset by a reduction of cash used in operations
 and a significant increase in inventory levels.

During
the twelve month period ended December 31
 2017
 we used cash of $7
334
239 in operations
 $535
196 for the purchase of equipment
net of sales of equipment
 and $29
179 for patents and trademarks

Our
liquidity needs will depend on how quickly we are able ramp up sales
 as well as our ability to control and reduce variable operating
expenses
 and to continue to control and reduce fixed overhead expense.

During
2016 we issued 28
277
329 shares of our common stock (&ldquo;Shares&rdquo;) and warrants to purchase 14
033
438 Shares (&ldquo;Warrants&rdquo;)
for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $18
812
690. Of these total amounts 24
598
674 Shares were issued for cash of $16
457
150;
3
502
327 Shares were issued for Conversion of Debt in the amount of $2
242
692; and 176
328 Shares were issued in settlement
of debt in the amount of $112
849. Of the total 14
033
438 Warrants issued during 2016
 3
877
186 are priced at $1
00; 7
812
500
are priced at $0.88
 and 2
343
752 are priced at $0.75. The 2016 financing activity occurred in three separate private placements
with accredited investors. In the first transaction
 we issued 7
754
373 Shares and five year Warrants priced at $1.00 to purchase
up to 3
877
186 Shares
 for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $6
203
498. The first transaction consists of two components:
a new equity raise in the amount of $3
570
000 and the conversion into common equity of $2
633
498 of principal and interest of
convertible promissory notes previously issued during the fourth quarter of 2016. In the second transaction
 we sold 4
687
504
Shares and five year Warrants priced at $.75 to purchase up to 2
343
752 Shares
 for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of
$3
000
000. In the third transaction we sold 15
625
000 Shares
 and five year Warrants priced at $.88 to purchase up to 7
812
500
shares for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $10
000
000. During 2016 we also converted $52
613 of debt into 210
455
shares of stock
 related to a note that was settled for most investors during 2015.

We
did not issue any additional securities or debt during 2017.

On
February 14
 2018
 we announced the private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million The closing shall
be no later than five (5) business days after receipt of notice from the Company that it has achieved certain milestones establishing
significant sales to national accounts. One milestone is that the Company shall have entered into a material agreement or series
of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 1
000 new locations This first milestone
was achieved on March 8
 2018. The other milestone is that the Company shall have entered into a material agreement or series
of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 2
500 new locations.

Upon
achievement of the first milestone
 60% of the principal amount of the convertible notes will be available to the Company
 with
the balance of 40% upon achievement of the second milestone. The Company intends to use the proceeds from this financing to fund
the manufacture of inventory
 to purchase equipment
 and for general corporate purposes.


    
    



The
convertible notes are unsecured and have (i) a two-year term
 (ii) a 10% annual coupon to be paid in cash or stock at the Company&rsquo;s
discretion at a conversion price equal to 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the payment date
 but in no event lower than sixty cents ($0.60) per share of Common
Stock. The investor&rsquo;s may elect to convert their principal into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of:
(i) $0.88 per share of Common Stock
 or (ii) 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the date of investor&rsquo;s election to convert; but in no event lower than $0.60 per
share of Common Stock. Investors also received warrant coverage of 25% of the number of shares that would be issuable upon a full
conversion of the principal amount at an average of the twenty consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the applicable
closing date. If any principal amount remains outstanding after the one-year anniversary of the closing
 investors will be granted
an additional warrant with identical terms. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years for cash at the greater of
120% of the closing price or $0.70 per share of common stock. On March 5
 2018
 the Company issued a Promissory Note to an existing
investor
 in the amount of $250
000. The unsecured note bears interest at 12%
 and has a 6 month term Proceeds are being used
to fund the short term working capital needs of the Company. The Company plans to refinance this note upon maturity.

Our
operations to date have been financed by the sale of securities
 the issuance of convertible debt and the issuance of
short-term debt
 including related party advances. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations with the


carry out our current plan of operations.

We

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31
 2017.


    
    



Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act
 for the Company.

Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management
and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management
recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control
 and accordingly
 even effective
internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or
detect material misstatements. In addition
 effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods
because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2017.
The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled &ldquo;Internal
Control &ndash; Integrated Framework&rdquo; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
in 2013 which assessment identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a
control deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that creates a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement in annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31
 2017.

Management
has identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting:



    
    
Inadequate
    Segregation of Duties: We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement internal controls over financial reporting.


Since
the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting did identify material weaknesses
 management
considers its internal control over financial reporting to be ineffective.

Management
recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control
 and accordingly
 even effective
internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or
detect material misstatements. In addition
 effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods
because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.

Management
believes that the material weakness set forth above did not have an effect on the reporting of our financial results.

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weakness and enhance our internal control over financial reporting
 we plan to
engage additional financial personnel to help ensure that we are able to properly implement internal control procedures.

This
report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act
 or otherwise subject to the liabilities
of that section
 and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company
 whether made before or after the date hereof
regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.


    
    



Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31
2017 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
 and Director Independence.

Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions

The
following includes a summary of transactions since the beginning of fiscal 2017 or any currently proposed transaction
 in which
we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120
000 or one percent of the average
of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any related person had or will have a direct
or indirect material interest (other than compensation described under &ldquo;Executive Compensation&rdquo;). We believe the terms
obtained or consideration that we paid or received
 as applicable
 in connection with the transactions described below were comparable
to or better than terms available or the amounts that would be paid or received
 as applicable
 in arm&rsquo;s-length transactions.

There
were no related party transactions for the year ended December 31
 2017
 that meet the criteria described in the paragraph above.

The
Company&rsquo;s policy with regard to related party transactions requires any related party loans that are (i) non-interest bearing
and in excess of $100
000 or (ii) interest bearing
 irrespective of amount
 must be approved by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors.
All issuances of securities by the Company must be approved by the board of directors
 irrespective of whether the recipient is
a related party. Each of the foregoing transactions
 if required by its terms
 was approved in this manner.

Director
Independence

We
use the definition of &ldquo;independence&rdquo; standards as defined in the NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that
an &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having
a relationship
 which
 in the opinion of the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We have determined that four of our seven directors are independent
which constitutes a majority.

 or for services that are
normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years;
(ii) &ldquo;audit-related fees&rdquo; are fees for assurance and related services by our principal accountant that are reasonably
related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under &ldquo;audit fees;&rdquo;
(iii) &ldquo;tax fees&rdquo; are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for tax compliance

Audit
Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

Under
the SEC&rsquo;s rules
 an audit committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent
registered public accounting firm in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors&rsquo; independence. The SEC&rsquo;s
rules specify the types of non-audit services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the
audit committee&rsquo;s responsibility for administration of the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm.
The Company has established an Audit Committee. Accordingly
 audit services and non-audit services described in this Item 14 were
pre-approved by an Audit Committee.

There
were no hours expended on the principal accountant&rsquo;s engagement to audit the registrant&rsquo;s financial statements for
the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the principal accountant&rsquo;s full-time
permanent employees.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders

 Inc.

 California

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Barfresh Food Group
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December
31
 2017 and 2016
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows
 for the
years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
the consolidated financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Barfresh Food Group
Inc. as of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis
for Opinion
These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to Barfresh
Food Group
 Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether
due to error or fraud. Barfresh Food Group Inc. is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity&rsquo;s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
 whether
due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We
have served as Barfresh Food Group Inc.&rsquo;s auditor since 2012.

Note
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Barfresh
Food Group Inc.
 (&ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;us
&rdquo; &ldquo;our
&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated on February
25
 2010 in the State of Delaware. We are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend beverages
 particularly
smoothies
 shakes and frappes.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).

Basis
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries
 Barfresh
Inc. and Barfresh Corporation Inc. All inter-company balances and transactions among the companies have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

We
consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less
 at the time of purchase
 to be cash
equivalents.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

The
amount of cash on deposit with financial institutions exceeds the $250
000 federally insured limit at December 31
 2017 and 2016.
However
 we believe that cash on deposit that exceeds $250
000 in the financial institutions is financially sound and the risk
of loss is minimal.

Fair
Value Measurement

Financial
Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 820

Measurements and Disclosures
 provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures which are required about fair value measurements. Specifically
 ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and
establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques
 giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy
as follows:

Level
1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets
and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices
 such as equities listed
on the New York Stock Exchange.

Level
2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported
date. The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts
or priced with models using highly observable inputs.

Level
3 - Significant inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included
in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation
 such as complex and subjective models
and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.


    
    



Our
financial instruments consist of accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses and notes payable. The carrying value
of our financial instruments approximates their fair value due to their relative short maturities.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are typically unsecured. Our credit policy calls for payment generally within 30 days. The credit worthiness of a customer
is evaluated prior to a sale. As of December 31
 2017
 and 2016
 there is no allowance for doubtful accounts. There was no bad
debt expense for the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016.



Inventory
consists of finished goods and is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first in first out basis.

Intangible
Assets

Intangible
assets are comprised of patents
 net of amortization and trademarks. The patent costs are being amortized over the life of the
patent

- Goodwill and Other
 the costs of internally developing other intangible assets
 such as patents
are expensed as incurred. However
 as allowed by ASC 350
 costs associated with the acquisition of patents from third parties
legal fees and similar costs relating to patents have been capitalized.

In
accordance with ASC 350 legal costs related to trademarks have been capitalized. We have determined that trademarks have an indeterminable
life and therefore are not being amortized.

Property
Plant
 and Equipment

Property
plant
 and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss
 if any. Depreciation is
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are being amortized
over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term that includes any expected renewal periods that are deemed
to be reasonably assured. The estimated useful lives used for financial statement purposes are:

Furniture
and fixtures: 5 years
Manufacturing
Equipment: 7 years
Leasehold
improvements: 2 years
Vehicles
5 years

Revenue
Recognition

We
recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement
 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered
 the
sales price is determinable
 and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is recorded net of provisions for discounts and promotion
allowances. Our products are sold on various terms. Our credit terms
 which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices
 typically require payment within 30 days of delivery. We recognize revenue upon receipt of our products by our distributors
and retail accounts
 in accordance with written sales terms
 net of provisions for discounts or allowances. Allowances for returns
and discounts are made on a case-by-case basis. Historically
 neither returns nor discounts have been material.

Research
and Development

Expenditures
for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred. We incurred $574
989
and $432
146
 in research and development expenses for the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.


    
    



Rent
Expense

We
recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term as defined in ASC Topic 840


$165 at December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
 and will be charged to rent expense over the life of the lease. Total amount
of rent expense incurred in 2017 was $142
572 and in 2016 was $96
151.

Income
Taxes

The
provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 
(&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;). Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized
in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
facts.

ASC
740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more
than likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.

For
the years ended December 31
 2017 and 2016 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain
tax positions.

Earnings
per Share

We
calculate net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260
. Basic net loss per share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings
per share is computed by including common stock equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31
 2017
and 2016 any equivalents would have been anti-dilutive as we had losses for the periods then ended.

Stock
Based Compensation

We
calculate stock compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718
 (&ldquo;ASC 718&rdquo;).
ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and
establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities
to apply a fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity
instruments held by employee stock ownership plans

Recent
pronouncements

From
time to time
 new accounting pronouncements are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact
of recently issued standards not yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial position.


    
    



In
May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 which converged guidance on recognizing
revenue in contracts with customers on an effective date after our year ending December 31
 2017. The Company is in the initial
stages of evaluating the effect of the standard on our financial statements and continue to evaluate the available transition
methods. However
 based on our initial evaluation
 we do not expect there to be material changes to our current Revenue Recognition
policies due to the non-complex contracts with our customers
 including the definition of our performance obligations and the
transaction prices in our contracts with our customers.

The
Company has evaluated the effect of the standard on our financial statements
 and based on our evaluation
 we do not expect there
to be material impact to our financial statement.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will
require organizations that lease assets (&ldquo;lessees&rdquo;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its
balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&rsquo;s obligation to make lease
payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&rsquo;s right to
use
 or control use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization
that own the assets leased to the lessee (&ldquo;lessor&rdquo;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it
with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The
Company is in the initial stages of evaluating the effect of the standard on our financial statements and continue to evaluate
the available transition methods. However
 based on our initial evaluation
 we do not expect there to be material changes to both
our current and long-term lease liabilities and our fixed assets of our limited number of operating leases that will be converted
to financing leases under the new guidance. The Company does not plan to adopt the standard until the interim period ended March
31
 2019.

In
August 2014
 the FASB issued FASB ASU2014-15

of Uncertainties about an Entities Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
of uncertainties about an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. FASB ASU2014-15 is effective for annual periods
ending after December 15
 2016
 and for interim periods within annual periods beginning after that date. These changes require
an entity&rsquo;s management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial
doubt about an entities ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.
If management has concluded that substantial doubt exists
 then the following disclosures should be made in the financial statements:
(i) principal conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt; (ii) management&rsquo;s evaluation of the significance of
those conditions or events in relation to the entities ability to meet those obligations; (iii) management&rsquo;s plans that
alleviated the initial substantial doubt or
 if substantial doubt was not alleviated
 management&rsquo;s plans that are intended
to at least mitigate the conditions or events that raise the substantial doubt
 and (iv) if management&rsquo;s plans did not alleviate
the substantial doubt
 an explicit statement that there is a substantial doubt. These changes are reflected in the disclosure
included in Note 10.

Note
3. Intangible Assets
As
of December 31
 2017
 intangible assets consist of patent costs of $764
891
 trademarks of $88
853 and accumulated amortization
of $266
801

As
of December 31
 2016
 intangible assets consist of patent costs of $750
640
 trademarks of $73
925 and accumulated amortization
of $204
702.

The
amounts carried on the balance sheet represent cost to acquire
 legal fees and similar costs relating to the patents incurred
by the Company. Amortization is calculated through the expiration date of the patent
 which is December
 2025. The amount charged
to expenses for amortization of the patent costs was $62
099 and $61
483 for the year ended December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

ASC
740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more
than likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized. After consideration of all the
evidence
 both positive and negative
 management has determined that a $6
902
200 and $7
766
100 allowance at December 31
 2017
and 2016
 respectively
 is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The reduction in the valuation allowance for the current period is $863
900.

As
of December 31
 2017
 we have a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $28
404
200. The loss will be available to offset
future taxable income. If not used
 this carry forward will expire as follows:

Note
10. Liquidity

We
have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow. As our operations grow
 we expect to experience significant increases
in our working capital requirements. These conditions raise substantial doubt over the Company&rsquo;s ability to meet all of
its obligations over the twelve months following the filing of this Form 10-K. Management has evaluated these conditions
 and
concluded that current plans will alleviate this concern. As of December 31
 2017
 we had no debt. On February 14
 2018
 we announced
the private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million. The funding of that note occurs upon the achievement
of certain milestones establishing significant sales to national accounts. One milestone is that the Company shall have entered
into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately
1
000 new locations. The first milestone was achieved on March 8
 2018. According to the terms of the Convertible Note
 60% of
the gross proceeds
 or $2.5 million
 was received by the Company within five business days of that Milestone 1 achievement. The
other milestone is that the Company shall have entered into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national
account for the sale of its products into approximately 2
500 new locations. We expect the second Milestone to occur during 2018.
On March 5
 2018
 the Company issued a Promissory Note to an existing investor
 in the amount of $250
000. The unsecured note
bears interest at 12%
 and has a 6 month term Proceeds are being used to fund the short term working capital needs of the Company.
The Company plans to refinance this note upon maturity. In addition
 we have significantly reduced core operating costs beginning
in 2016
 including reducing the number of our employees from 44 to 30 over this time period. Members of the senior management
team have deferred a portion of their salaries during 2017
 and are continuing to defer a portion of their salaries in 2018. Management
is prepared to take further similar actions to reduce or defer fixed overhead should that become necessary. Management has concluded
that it is probable that the combination of the above described financings which have already been achieved and are about to be
achieved
 along with the described measures available to reduce or defer fixed overhead
 alleviate the substantial doubt of our
ability to continue as a going concern. However
 the Company cannot predict
 with certainty
 the outcome of its action to generate
liquidity
 including the availability of additional financing
 or whether such actions would generate the expected liquidity as
planned.

Note
11. Subsequent Events

On
February 14
 2018
 we announced the private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million The closing shall
be no later than five (5) business days after receipt of notice from the Company that it has achieved certain milestones establishing
significant sales to national accounts. One milestone is that the Company shall have entered into a material agreement or series
of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 1
000 new locations. The first milestone
was achieved on March 8
 2018. The other milestone is that the Company shall have entered into a material agreement or series
of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 2
500 new locations.

Upon
achievement of the first milestone
 60% of the principal amount of the convertible notes will be available to the Company
 with
the balance of 40% upon achievement of the second milestone. The Company intends to use the proceeds from this financing to fund
the manufacture of inventory
 to purchase equipment
 and for general corporate purposes.

The
convertible notes are unsecured and have (i) a two-year term
 (ii) a 10% annual coupon to be paid in cash or stock at the Company&rsquo;s
discretion at a conversion price equal to 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the payment date
 but in no event lower than sixty cents ($0.60) per share of Common
Stock. The investor&rsquo;s may elect to convert their principal into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of:
(i) $0.88 per share of Common Stock
 or (ii) 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the date of investor&rsquo;s election to convert; but in no event lower than $0.60 per
share of Common Stock. Investors also received warrant coverage of 25% of the number of shares that would be issuable upon a full
conversion of the principal amount at an average of the twenty consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the applicable
closing date. If any principal amount remains outstanding after the one-year anniversary of the closing
 investors will be granted
an additional warrant with identical terms. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years for cash at the greater of
120% of the closing price or $0.70 per share of common stock.

On
March 5
 2018
 the Company issued a Promissory Note to an existing investor
 in the amount of $250
000. The unsecured note bears
interest at 12%
 and has a 6 month term Proceeds are being used to fund the short term working capital needs of the Company. The
Company plans to refinance this note upon maturity.&nbsp;

 Leases
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease&#13;assets (&amp;#8220;lessees&amp;#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with&#13;terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
&#13;measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
 a specified&#13;asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets leased to the&#13;lessee (&amp;#8220;lessor&amp;#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and&#13;Topic 606

 based on our initial evaluation
 we do not expect there to be material changes to both our current and long-term lease&#13;liabilities and our fixed assets of our limited number of operating leases that will be converted to financing leases under the&#13;new guidance. The Company does not plan to adopt the standard until the interim period ended March 31

 &lt;i&gt;Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entities&#13;Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&lt;/i&gt;. FASB ASU 2015-15 changes the disclosure requirements of uncertainties about an entity&amp;#8217;s&#13;ability to continue as a going concern. FASB ASU2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and for&#13;interim periods within annual periods beginning after that date. These changes require an entity&amp;#8217;s management to evaluate&#13;whether there are conditions or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about an entities ability to&#13;continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. If management has concluded that&#13;substantial doubt exists
 then the following disclosures should be made in the financial statements: (i) principal conditions&#13;or events that raised the substantial doubt; (ii) management&amp;#8217;s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events&#13;in relation to the entities ability to meet those obligations; (iii) management&amp;#8217;s plans that alleviated the initial substantial&#13;doubt or
 if substantial doubt was not alleviated
 management&amp;#8217;s plans that are intended to at least mitigate the conditions&#13;or events that raise the substantial doubt
 and (iv) if management&amp;#8217;s plans did not alleviate the substantial doubt

&#13;60% of the principal amount of the convertible notes will be available to the Company
 with the balance of 40% upon achievement&#13;of the second milestone. The Company intends to use the proceeds from this financing to fund the manufacture of inventory

 we expect to experience significant increases in our working capital requirements.&#13;These conditions raise substantial doubt over the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to meet all of its obligations over the twelve months&#13;following the filing of this Form 10-K. Management has evaluated these conditions
 and concluded that current plans will alleviate&#13;this concern. As of December 31
 2017
 we had no debt. On February 14
 2018
 we announced the private placement of convertible&#13;notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million. The funding of that note occurs upon the achievement of certain milestones establishing&#13;significant sales to national accounts. One milestone is that the Company shall have entered into a material agreement or series&#13;of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 1
000 new locations. The first milestone&#13;was achieved on March 8
 2018. According to the terms of the Convertible Note
 60% of the gross proceeds
 or $2.5 million
 was&#13;received by the Company within five business days of that Milestone 1 achievement. The other milestone is that the Company shall&#13;have entered into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into&#13;approximately 2
500 new locations. We expect the second Milestone to occur during 2018. On March 5
 2018
 the Company issued a&#13;Promissory Note to an existing investor
 in the amount of $250
000. The unsecured note bears interest at 12%
 and has a 6 month&#13;term Proceeds are being used to fund the short term working capital needs of the Company. The Company plans to refinance this&#13;note upon maturity. In addition
 we have significantly reduced core operating costs beginning in 2016
 including reducing the&#13;number of our employees from 44 to 30 over this time period. Members of the senior management team have deferred a portion of&#13;their salaries during 2017
 and are continuing to defer a portion of their salaries in 2018. Management is prepared to take further&#13;similar actions to reduce or defer fixed overhead should that become necessary. Management has concluded that it is probable that&#13;the combination of the above described financings which have already been achieved and are about to be achieved
 along with the&#13;described measures available to reduce or defer fixed overhead
 alleviate the substantial doubt of our ability to continue as&#13;a going concern. However
 the Company cannot predict
 with certainty
 the outcome of its action to generate liquidity
 including&#13;the availability of additional financing

 we believe that cash on deposit

(&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 820
 
(&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;)
 provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required
about fair value measurements. Specifically
 ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing
the inputs to valuation techniques
 giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:


available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included
in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices
 such as equities listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.


are other than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types
of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with
models using highly observable inputs.


to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with
inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation
 such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine
the fair value of financial transmission rights.


accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses and notes payable. The carrying value of our financial instruments approximates
their fair value due to their relative short maturities.




Our credit policy calls for payment generally within 30 days. The credit worthiness of a customer is evaluated prior to a sale.
As of December 31
 2017
 and 2016
 there is no allowance for doubtful accounts. There was no bad debt expense for the years ended
December 31
 2017 and 2016.

net of amortization and trademarks. The patent costs are being amortized over the life of the patent

 (&#8220;ASC

 the costs of internally developing other intangible assets
 such as patents

 as
allowed by ASC 350
 costs associated with the acquisition of patents from third parties

 if any. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are being amortized over the shorter of the useful life of
the asset or the lease term that includes any expected renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured. The estimated
useful lives used for financial statement purposes are:

terms. Our credit terms
 which are established in accordance with local and industry practices
 typically require payment within
30 days of delivery. We recognize revenue upon receipt of our products by our distributors and retail accounts

written sales terms

basis. Historically
 neither returns nor discounts have been material.

basis over the reasonably assured lease term as defined in ASC Topic 840
(&#8220;ASC 840&#8221;). Rent expense is
charged to expense beginning with the occupancy date. Deferred rent was $495 and $165 at December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
and will be charged to rent expense over the life of the lease. Total amount of rent expense incurred in 2017 was $142

in 2016 was $96

in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). Under this method
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


for how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
 uncertain tax positions taken
or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements
when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must
initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.


to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more than likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.

with ASC Topic 260
. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings per share is computed by including common stock
equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31
 2017 and 2016 any equivalents would have been anti-dilutive
as we had losses for the periods then ended.




with ASC Topic 718
 (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;). ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting
from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement
objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement
method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee stock ownership

2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 which converged guidance on recognizing revenue in contracts with customers
on an effective date after our year ending December 31
 2017. The Company is in the initial stages of evaluating the effect of
the standard on our financial statements and continue to evaluate the available transition methods. However
 based on our initial
evaluation
 we do not expect there to be material changes to our current Revenue Recognition policies due to the non-complex contracts
with our customers
 including the definition of our performance obligations and the transaction prices in our contracts with our
customers.

 we do not expect there to be material impact to our financial
statement.


 the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02
 Leases
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease
assets (&#8220;lessees&#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with
terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
 a specified
asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets leased to the
lessee (&#8220;lessor&#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and

of evaluating the effect of the standard on our financial statements and continue to evaluate the available transition methods.
However
 based on our initial evaluation
 we do not expect there to be material changes to both our current and long-term lease
liabilities and our fixed assets of our limited number of operating leases that will be converted to financing leases under the
new guidance. The Company does not plan to adopt the standard until the interim period ended March 31
 2019.

Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
ability to continue as a going concern. FASB ASU2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and for
interim periods within annual periods beginning after that date. These changes require an entity&#8217;s management to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about an entities ability to
continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. If management has concluded that
substantial doubt exists
 then the following disclosures should be made in the financial statements: (i) principal conditions
or events that raised the substantial doubt; (ii) management&#8217;s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events
in relation to the entities ability to meet those obligations; (iii) management&#8217;s plans that alleviated the initial substantial
doubt or
 if substantial doubt was not alleviated
 management&#8217;s plans that are intended to at least mitigate the conditions
or events that raise the substantial doubt
 and (iv) if management&#8217;s plans did not alleviate the substantial doubt
 an explicit
statement that there is a substantial doubt. These changes are reflected in the disclosure included in Note 10.

 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]









and negative cash flow. As our operations grow
 we expect to experience significant increases in our working capital requirements.
These conditions raise substantial doubt over the Company&#8217;s ability to meet all of its obligations over the twelve months
following the filing of this Form 10-K. Management has evaluated these conditions
 and concluded that current plans will alleviate
this concern. As of December 31
 2017
 we had no debt. On February 14
 2018
 we announced the private placement of convertible
notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million. The funding of that note occurs upon the achievement of certain milestones establishing
significant sales to national accounts. One milestone is that the Company shall have entered into a material agreement or series
of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 1
000 new locations. The first milestone
was achieved on March 8
 2018. According to the terms of the Convertible Note
 60% of the gross proceeds
 or $2.5 million
 was
received by the Company within five business days of that Milestone 1 achievement. The other milestone is that the Company shall
have entered into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into
approximately 2
500 new locations. We expect the second Milestone to occur during 2018. On March 5
 2018
 the Company issued a
Promissory Note to an existing investor
 in the amount of $250
000. The unsecured note bears interest at 12%
 and has a 6 month
term Proceeds are being used to fund the short term working capital needs of the Company. The Company plans to refinance this
note upon maturity. In addition
 we have significantly reduced core operating costs beginning in 2016
 including reducing the
number of our employees from 44 to 30 over this time period. Members of the senior management team have deferred a portion of
their salaries during 2017
 and are continuing to defer a portion of their salaries in 2018. Management is prepared to take further
similar actions to reduce or defer fixed overhead should that become necessary. Management has concluded that it is probable that
the combination of the above described financings which have already been achieved and are about to be achieved
 along with the
described measures available to reduce or defer fixed overhead
 alleviate the substantial doubt of our ability to continue as
a going concern. However
 the Company cannot predict
 with certainty
 the outcome of its action to generate liquidity
 including
the availability of additional financing
 or whether such actions would generate the expected liquidity as planned.

 2018
 we announced the
private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million The closing shall be no later than five (5) business
days after receipt of notice from the Company that it has achieved certain milestones establishing significant sales to national
accounts. One milestone is that the Company shall have entered into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a
national account for the sale of its products into approximately 1
000 new locations. The first milestone was achieved on March
8
 2018. The other milestone is that the Company shall have entered into a material agreement or series of related agreements with
a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 2
500 new locations.


60% of the principal amount of the convertible notes will be available to the Company
 with the balance of 40% upon achievement
of the second milestone. The Company intends to use the proceeds from this financing to fund the manufacture of inventory
 to purchase
equipment
 and for general corporate purposes.


and have (i) a two-year term
 (ii) a 10% annual coupon to be paid in cash or stock at the Company&#8217;s discretion at a conversion
price equal to 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period immediately
preceding the payment date
 but in no event lower than sixty cents ($0.60) per share of Common Stock. The investor&#8217;s may
elect to convert their principal into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of: (i) $0.88 per share of Common Stock
or (ii) 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period immediately
preceding the date of investor&#8217;s election to convert; but in no event lower than $0.60 per share of Common Stock. Investors
also received warrant coverage of 25% of the number of shares that would be issuable upon a full conversion of the principal amount
at an average of the twenty consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the applicable closing date. If any principal
amount remains outstanding after the one-year anniversary of the closing
 investors will be granted an additional warrant with
identical terms. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years for cash at the greater of 120% of the closing price
or $0.70 per share of common stock.

(&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 820
 
(&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;)
 provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required
about fair value measurements. Specifically
 ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing
the inputs to valuation techniques
 giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:


available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included
in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices
 such as equities listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.


are other than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types
of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with
models using highly observable inputs.


to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with
inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation
 such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine
the fair value of financial transmission rights.

 accounts payable
 accrued expenses and notes payable. The carrying value of our financial instruments approximates
their fair value due to their relative short maturities.








Our credit policy calls for payment generally within 30 days. The credit worthiness of a customer is evaluated prior to a sale.
As of December 31
 2017

basis over the reasonably assured lease term as defined in ASC Topic 840
(&#8220;ASC 840&#8221;). Rent expense
is charged to expense beginning with the occupancy date. Deferred rent was $495 and $165 at December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
and will be charged to rent expense over the life of the lease. Total amount of rent expense incurred in 2017 was $142

in 2016 was $96

in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). Under this method
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


for how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
 uncertain tax positions taken
or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements
when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must
initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.


to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more than likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.


 2017
and 2016 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.








accordance with ASC Topic 260
. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings per share is computed by including common
stock equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31
 2017 and 2016 any equivalents would have been
anti-dilutive as we had losses for the periods then ended.








accordance with ASC Topic 718
 (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;). ASC 718 requires that the
cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value
as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based
measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee
stock ownership plans

 which converged guidance on recognizing revenue in contracts with customers
on an effective date after our year ending December 31
 2017. The Company is in the initial stages of evaluating the effect of
the standard on our financial statements and continue to evaluate the available transition methods. However

 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease
assets (&#8220;lessees&#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with
terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
 a specified
asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets leased to the
lessee (&#8220;lessor&#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and

However
 based on our initial evaluation
 we do not expect there to be material changes to both our current and long-term lease

new guidance. The Company does not plan to adopt the standard until the interim period ended March 31

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
