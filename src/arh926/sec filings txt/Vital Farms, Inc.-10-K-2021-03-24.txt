 who are the foundation of our resilient and reliable supply chain
























 development and overall well-being




























 with a network of more than 200 family farms
 we believe our pasture-raised products have set the national standard for ethically produced food. We believe the success of our relationships with small family farms and the efficiency of our supply chain provide us with a competitive advantage in the approximately $45&#160;billion U.S. natural food and beverage industry
 in which achieving reliable supply at a national scale can be challenging. In 2017
 we opened Egg Central Station
 a shell egg processing facility in Springfield
 Missouri
 which is centrally located within our network of family farms. Egg Central Station is capable of packing three million eggs per day and has achieved Safe Quality Food
 or SQF
 Excellent rating
 the highest level of such certification recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative
 or GFSI. In addition
 Egg Central Station is the only egg facility
 and we are one of only six companies globally to have received the Safe Quality Food Institute
 or SQFI
 Select Site certification
 indicating that the site has voluntarily elected to undergo annual unannounced recertification audits by SQFI
 the organization responsible for administering a global food safety and quality program known as the SQF Program. The design of Egg Central Station includes investments in support of each of our stakeholders
 from our crew members (daylighting
 climate control
 slip resistant floors in the egg grading room)
 to the community and environment (consulting with the community before we built the facility
 restoring native vegetation on the property
 best-in-class storm water management)
 to our customers and consumers (food safety and maintenance investments far beyond regulatory requirements). In November 2019
 we began construction on a facility expansion that will nearly double our current square footage. This expansion will enable us to double our capacity to meet growing demand. We expect the expansion to be operational in early 2022. We believe owning and operating this important element of our supply chain is a key differentiator and provides us with a competitive advantage
 which we intend to continue to leverage to grow both our net revenue and gross margin.

 which represents a 60% compounded annual growth rate
 or CAGR. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2020
 we grew net revenue by 101% and the number of stores carrying our products increased by 52%. Going forward
 we believe the consumer movement away from factory farming practices will continue to fuel demand for ethically produced food. We believe these demands extend to the food industry and that consumers are recognizing the benefits of pasture-raised egg and dairy products. Management is committed to ensuring our values remain aligned with those of our consumers while delivering stockholder value.

 Texas. Armed with a small flock of hens
 the company maintained a strong belief that a varied diet and better animal welfare practices would lead to superior eggs. Our first sales came from farmers markets and restaurants around Austin and
 less than a year later
 our eggs were discovered by Whole Foods Market
 Inc.
 or Whole Foods. The opportunity was identified to do something more than sell eggs to a few stores. The opportunity was to build a sustainable company that aligned with the family farming community and was able to profitably deliver quality products to a devoted consumer base. As our business has continued to grow
 our model remains rooted in trust and mutual accountability with our farmers
 who are and will remain core to our business.

 our current president and chief executive officer
 Russell Diez-Canseco
 joined Vital Farms and led the development of our large and scalable network of family farms. In 2015
 recognizing the opportunity to elevate our production process and bolster long-term growth and profitability
 we began the design process for Egg Central Station
 which opened in 2017 in Springfield
 Missouri. We meticulously designed Egg Central Station in service of all of our stakeholders by improving on the best practices we observed across numerous world-class facilities. Today
 Egg Central Station is capable of packing three million eggs per day and has achieved an SQF Excellent rating
 the highest level of such certification recognized by GFSI. In addition
 Egg Central Station is the only egg facility
 and we are one of only six companies globally to have received the SQFI Select Site certification.

 long-term business opportunities for small family farmers. Moreover
 we are driven to stand up for sustainable production practices that have been largely cast aside under the factory farming system. In our view
 this system has been consistently misguided
 focused on producing products at lowest cost rather than driving long-term and sustainable benefits for all stakeholders. 

 our values have been rooted in the principles of Conscious Capitalism. We believe managing our business in the best interest of all of our stakeholders will result in a more successful and sustainable enterprise. A key premise of our business model is our consumer-centric approach
 which focuses on identifying consumer needs and developing products that address these needs. While remaining committed to ethical decision-making
 we have achieved strong financial performance and earned the Certified B Corporation designation
 reflecting our role as a contributor to the global cultural shift toward redefining success in business in order to build a more inclusive and sustainable economy. We believe our consumers connect with Vital Farms because they love our products
 relate to our values and trust our practices. 


 environmental and agricultural impacts of processed food and factory farming standards has resulted in increased consumer demand for ethically produced food. We believe this trend has had a meaningful impact on the growth of the natural food industry
 which is increasingly penetrating the broader U.S. food market as mainstream retailers respond to consumer demand. We believe increased demand for natural food and a willingness to pay a premium for brands focused on transparency
 sustainability and ethical values will continue to be a catalyst for our growth.
According to SPINS
 LLC
 or SPINS data
 the U.S. shell egg market accounted for approximately $6.5 billion in retail sales for the 52 weeks ended December 27
 3% between 2018 and December 2020. Our relatively low household penetration of 3.9%
 compared to the shell egg category penetration of approximately 98%
 provides a significant long-term growth opportunity for our business. According to SPINS data
 the U.S. pasture-raised retail egg market accounted for approximately $256.0 million in retail sales for the 52 weeks ended December 27
 2020 and grew at a CAGR of 35% between 2018 and December 2020
 while the specialty egg (including pasture-raised
 free-range and cage-free) market accounted for approximately $1.3 billion in retail sales for the 52 weeks ended December 27
 2020 and grew at a CAGR of 14% between 2018 and December 2020. Additionally
 we estimate that the U.S. processed egg market as of December 2020 accounted for approximately $3.3 billion in retail sales. According to SPINS data
 the U.S. butter market accounted for approximately $4.0 billion in retail sales for the 52 weeks ended December 27
 2020 and grew at a CAGR of 10% between 2018 and December 2020. We believe the strength of our platform
 coupled with significant investments in our crew members and infrastructure
 position us to continue to deliver industry-leading growth across new and existing categories.

 our brand resonates with consumers who seek to align themselves with companies that share their values. Through our Vital Times newsletter and social media presence
 we cultivate and support our relationship with consumers by communicating our values

 which sell for as much as three times the price of commodity eggs. We believe that our products are more attractive to retail customers because they help generate growth

 demonstrate our commitment to our network of small family farms through educational programs that transfer critical best practice knowledge and pay farmers competitive prices for high-quality pasture-raised eggs. During fiscal year 2020
 we experienced no voluntary attrition for supply contract renewals. We believe our commitment to farmers facilitates more sustainable farm operations and significantly reduces turnover. Our network of small family farms gives us a strategic advantage through a scaled and sustainable supply chain and allows us to go to market with the highest quality pasture-raised premium products.

 our stakeholders and our infrastructure position us to continue delivering industry-leading growth that outpaces both the natural food industry and the overall food industry. 


 our values and the premium quality of our products
 we intend to increase our household penetration. Our relatively low household penetration of 3.9% for our pasture-raised shell eggs
 compared to the shell egg category penetration of approximately 98%
 shows that expanding the national presence of our brand offers a significant runway for future growth. 

 social media tools and other owned media channels. We believe these efforts will educate consumers on our ethical values and the attractive attributes of our pasture-raised products
 generate further demand for our products and ultimately expand our consumer base. 


 we believe there is significant opportunity to grow volume with existing retail customers. Our products generate stronger velocities and
 we believe
 greater profitability per unit for our retail customers in the categories in which we compete. By capturing greater shelf space
 driving higher product velocities and increasing our SKU count
 we believe there is meaningful runway for further growth with existing retail customers. Beyond our existing retail footprint
 we believe there is significant opportunity to gain incremental stores from existing retail customers as well as to add new retail customers. We also believe there are significant further long-term opportunities in additional distribution channels
 including the convenience

orted by joint marketing and advertising. Our brand has a differentiated value proposition with consumers
 and we believe consumers are increasingly demanding ethically produced ingredients when they eat outside of the home. We are also working with Acosta Foodservice
 a foodservice sales and marketing agency in the consumer-packaged goods industry
 to increase our broadline distribution and presence in national and regional restaurant chains. We believe that more consumers will look for our products on menus
 particularly with foodservice partners whose values are aligned with our own
 and that on-menu branding of our products as ingredients in popular meals and menu items will drive traffic and purchases in the foodservice channel. An example of our recent foodservice growth initiative is our relationship with Tacodeli
 which sells breakfast tacos made exclusively with our pasture-raised shell eggs across 11 restaurant locations and approximately 90 points of distribution
 such as coffee shops and farmers&#8217; market stands
 across Texas. We have launched similar regional concepts with Moe&#8217;s Broadway Bagel
 an East Coast-style family-run bagel chain in the Denver/Boulder
 Colorado area; Cafe Patachou
 a breakfast and lunch restaurant based in the Indianapolis
 Indiana area with 5 locations; Roam Artisan Burgers
 a fast-casual burger restaurant dedicated to high-quality sourcing in the San Francisco
 California area with 6 locations; Homegrown
 a sustainability-focused brand in the Seattle
 Washington area with 11 locations; and Pura Vida
 a fresh all-day concept in the Miami
 Florida area with 7 locations . We believe branded foodservice offerings will further drive consumer awareness of our brand and purchase rates of our products in the retail channel. 



The successes of our core products have confirmed our belief that there is significant demand for pasture-raised and ethically produced food products. We expect to continue to extend our product offerings through innovation in both new and existing categories
 including with our launch of pasture-raised egg bites in August 2020. In 2018
 we launched the only pasture-raised hard-boiled eggs in the U.S. market
 and in 2019
 we launched both ghee and liquid whole eggs
 the latter of which are the only pasture-raised liquid whole eggs in the U.S. market. The success of our product portfolio and our proprietary consumer surveys confirm our belief that there is significant demand for our brand across a wide spectrum of food categories. Within this broader market

 which require each hen to have at least 108 square feet of land and daily outdoor access. Our pasture-raised shell eggs are ethically produced and our consumers consistently tell us that they provide a richer taste and color than other eggs on the market. The retail varieties of our pasture-raised shell eggs are based on supplemental feed type (certified organic
 non-GMO project verified and conventional)
 egg size (small
 medium
 large
 extra large and jumbo) and pack size (6
 12 and 18 count).


 we saw an opportunity in the U.S. refrigerated value-added dairy market for premium
 pasture-raised butter with artisanal qualities
 such as higher butterfat content
 sea salt and traditional slow-churn methods. Our consumer research and basket analysis also identified butter as a highly complementary product category to eggs in terms of usage and buyer profile. Today
 we offer unsalted and sea salted varieties of our pasture-raised butter
 which has 85% butterfat and is sold in two-stick packs.


 we launched pasture-raised hard-boiled eggs to broaden the appeal of our brand and satisfy an incremental usage occasion&#8212;ready-to-eat snacking. That launch was quickly followed by the introduction of our pasture-raised liquid whole eggs in August 2019. We currently provide the only pasture-raised liquid whole egg in the estimated $3.2&#160;billion U.S. processed egg market
 which has seen little innovation in decades and has traditionally been dominated by egg whites.


 we introduced pasture-raised ghee
 followed in August 2019 by the release of a first of its kind ghee in a squeeze bottle format. Our pasture-raised ghee meets the standards consumers expect from the Vital Farms brand
 with original and pink Himalayan salt varieties.


 we introduced our pasture-raised egg bites
 which are made with ethically sourced ingredients
 such as pasture-raised eggs and cheese
 humanely raised meats
 and vegetables
 and are gluten-free. The egg bites are available in four flavors: uncured bacon and cheddar cheese; roasted red pepper and mozzarella cheese; ham
 bell peppers
 onions and cheddar cheese; and sun-dried tomato
 basil and mozzarella cheese. Each package contains two fully cooked egg bites and is able to be warmed directly in the microwave for a convenient and high protein breakfast or snack.

 including with our launch of pasture-raised egg bites in August 2020. We have a dedicated product development team that leverages comprehensive consumer insights and trend data to provide innovative solutions and ideas that meet new consumer needs and usage occasions. We also have a proven innovation model that utilizes a trusted network of partners to bring products to market without requiring significant upfront investment.

 2020. 




 consumer-centric marketing strategy has been instrumental in building our brand and driving net revenue. Our marketing strategy is aimed at solidifying our brand&#8217;s positioning as a leading provider of ethically produced food. We execute on this strategy by advertising through digitally integrated media campaigns
 social media tools and other owned media channels. Our brand&#8217;s standout packaging has been a signature communication vehicle since our inception. We maintain a presence across all major social media platforms. 
Our brand has grown rapidly into the #1&#160;U.S. pasture-raised
 #1 U.S. natural channel and #2 U.S. overall egg brand by retail dollar sales
 with an 82% share of the U.S. pasture-raised retail egg market for the 52-week period ended December 27
 2020. Our brand awareness is represented by a strong social media following
 with approximately 91
000 Instagram followers. Building on prior success
 we will continue to invest in the brand through digitally integrated national media campaigns and build customer loyalty through other media formats
 including our quirky Vital Times newsletter
 now in its tenth year of print
 which is placed in each egg carton. During the past two years
 we have circulated over 78&#160;million copies of our V

 we are focused on reaching new consumers to educate them about our ethically focused value proposition. We work continuously to understand our consumers and leverage those insights to develop impactful communication plans and messaging. We remain focused on deploying our sophisticated marketing capabilities and world-class sales team to ensure that both customers and consumers understand the Vital Farms story. 


 we currently distribute through third parties and direct to retailers to reach more than 16
000 stores. With significant expansion in recent years
 our retail sales are evenly distributed between the natural channel and mainstream channel. Because of our brand equity
 loyal consumer base and expanding line of high-quality products
 we believe there are attractive growth opportunities across these channels
 in addition to a sizable opportunity in the foodservice channel in the medium- to long-term. We believe there are also incremental growth opportunities in additional distribution channels

 we have a presence in foodservice through the sale of shell eggs to select accounts. We expect our foodservice business to continue to grow in the medium- to long-term through expansive new relationships with broad-line distributors

One example of our successful foodservice programs is Tacodeli. In the spring of 2019
 Tacodeli committed to exclusively using Vital Farms eggs for its breakfast tacos
 branded with our logo on menus and taco wrappers. We have also built a marketing partnership with Tacodeli to demonstrate the quality of our co-branded offering and to increase consumer awareness of our brands via social media
 public relations and other events.

 Egg Central Station is the only egg facility
 and we are one of only six companies globally to have received the SQFI Select Site certification
 indicating that the site has voluntarily elected to undergo annual unannounced recertification audits by SQFI
 the organization responsible for administering a global food safety and quality program known as the SQF Program. To facilitate further growth
 we have established a plan to double the capacity of Egg Central Station through a mirror-image expansion adjacent to the existing location. This expansion will enable us to double our capacity to meet growing demand. We began construction in November 2019 and expect the expansion to be operational in early 2022.

 hard-boiled eggs
 liquid whole egg and egg bites products have a dedicated co-manufacturing partner. To support the growth of our business
 we are focused on expanding existing relationships and establishing new co-manufacturing relationships. 
Our egg packaging consists primarily of corrugated boxes and egg cartons
 and we use a limited amount of recycled plastic packaging. Our corrugated boxes are sourced from a supplier in Springfield
 Missouri
 our egg cartons are sourced from Missouri
 Canada
 and Europe from a sole-source supplier  and our recycled plastic packaging is sourced from Mexico from a single-source supplier. Our other products are packaged in jars
 bottles
 film and cartons that are primarily managed by our co-manufacturing partners. In every case we strive to find the most sustainable and environmentally considered packaging

 including producers of private-label products
 as well as producers of other branded egg and butter products that compete for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. We compete with large egg companies such as Cal-Maine
 Inc. and large international food companies such as Ornua (Kerrygold). We also compete directly with local and regional egg companies
 as well as private-label specialty egg products processed by other egg companies. In our market
 competition is based on
 among other things
 product quality and taste
 brand recognition and loyalty
 product variety
 product packaging and package design
 shelf space
 reputation
 price
 advertising
 promotion and nutritional claims. 


Shell eggs may be sourced from hens that are caged
 cage free
 free range or pasture raised. Large egg companies offer commodity eggs sourced from caged hens
owing consumer demand for ethically produced and higher quality eggs
 they have also grown their cage-free and free-range offerings. 

 we believe that we have a strong and sustainable competitive advantage based on an ongoing process of values-driven decisions
 our fundamental commitment to producing food ethically and humanely
 the trust we have developed in our brand
 and our ability to provide reliable supply to our distribution partners and customers. We built and operate what we believe is one of the largest sourcing and distribution networks of family farms with strong growth potential. By focusing on the interests of each of our stakeholders
 we believe we have created a model that attracts the best family farm partners
 produces the highest quality product and creates benefits for all parties. We believe our experience in building this network will provide significant scale and execution advantages as we continue to expand.

 we have elected to have our social and environmental performance
 accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by B Lab
 an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment
 in December 2015
 we were designated as a Certified B Corporation. 

 companies are required to take a comprehensive and objective assessment of their positive impact on society and the environment. The assessment evaluates how a company&#8217;s operations and business model impacts its workers
 customers
 suppliers
 community and the environment using a 200-point scale. While the assessment varies depending on a company&#8217;s size (number of employees)
 sector and location
 representative indicators in the assessment include payment above a living wage
 employee benefits
 stakeholder engagement
 supporting underserved suppliers and environmental benefits from a company&#8217;s products or services. After completing the assessment
 B Lab will verify the company&#8217;s score to determine if it meets the 80-point minimum bar for certification. The review process includes a phone review
 a random selection of indicators for verifying documentation and a random selection of company locations for onsite reviews
 including employee interviews and facility tours. Once certified
 every Certified B Corporation must make its assessment score transparent on B Lab&#8217;s website. 

 we are required to update our assessment and verify our updated score with B Lab every three years. We were most recently recertified in February 2018 and are in the process of recertification with B Lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were randomly selected for an onsite review
 which is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Certified B Corporation designation remains in good standing while we conduct the recertification process.&nbsp;&nbsp; 


 we elected in October 2017 to be treated as a public benefit corporation under Delaware law. 

 a public benefit corporation is required to identify in its certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits it will promote and its directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the corporation&#8217;s stockholders
 the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation&#8217;s conduct

 we endeavor to provide our crew members with the resources they need to be successful
 along with culture-enhancing programs and professional development opportunities. 


 we believe in cultivating meaningful opportunities
 from supporting economic well-being for small family farmers to fostering a collaborative and inspiring environment for our crew members across the country. 

 we bring crew members into the business who we believe are aligned to our values and culture. For the fiscal year ended December 27
 2020
 we have received 13
733 employment applications and hired 113 new crew members. Between February&#160;14 and December 27
 2020
 we surveyed new hires within their first week of employment to gather feedback on their orientation experience
 and 94% of those surveyed indicated that they had a good orientation experience. The Vital Farms&#8217; crew member journey
 including recruiting
 onboarding and each step of the career experience
 is guided by the philosophy of caring for our crew. 

 in which we communicate regularly to our crew members across departments and position levels through weekly team huddles at Egg Central Station

 (2)&#160;Act Like an Owner
 (3)&#160;Lead with a Growth Mindset and (4)&#160;Practice Empathy. We strive to create a culture that reflects these important pillars of our business. 








We recognize that we win and lose as a team
 and we leave our egos at the door. We orient crew members towards common priorities by communicating priorities throughout the organization. Additionally
 each quarter
 crew members and their managers discuss professional development and set individual goals. We hold ourselves accountable to business objectives and know that we can all improve through continuous feedback. 








We know our crew plays a critical role in our success and want them to have a stake in the outcome that they help create. We provide all crew members generous benefits in terms of competitive compensation
 including hourly pay that is at least 25% above the living wage for an individual without children in the markets in which we operate (and at least 48% above minimum wage in Springfield
 Missouri
 for crew at Egg Central Station)

 crew members have completed 1
419 online courses. 








We know that we get to better answers when we incorporate different perspectives and experiences into our work. We believe a diverse
 equitable and inclusive crew is crucial to our long-term success as a business and a priority for us as our values remain rooted in Conscious Capitalism. As part of this commitment
 in September 2020
 we began a partnership with the National Diversity Council
 a national non-profit organization committed to fostering an environment for organizations to grow in their knowledge of diversity and their ability to practice empathy for others. We understand the importance of this work to our crew and plan to keep them informed of and engaged in this work in the months ahead. 


 2020
 we had approximately 215 full-time crew members

 33 in sales and marketing
 15 in finance and 20 in general and administrative functions
 all of whom are located in the United States. Of our full-time crew members
 four are contract workers. None of our crew members is represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage
 and we consider our relations with our crew members to be good.

 our net revenue increased from $106.7&#160;million in fiscal 2018 to $140.7&#160;million in fiscal 2019 to $214.3 million in fiscal 2020. This growth has placed significant demands on our management

 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020
 we generated net income of $5.6&#160;million
 $3.3&#160;million and $9.0 million
 respectively. However
 we have experienced net losses in prior years
 including a net loss of $2.1&#160;million in fiscal 2017. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is subject to various factors
 many of which are beyond our control. As we expand our operations
 we anticipate that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to increase our household penetration
 customer base
 supplier network
 marketing channels and product portfolio
 expand and enhance our processing
 manufacturing and distribution facilities as needed
 and hire additional crew members. Our expansion efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate (including as a result of increases in equipment prices
 which may be due to actual or threatened disruptions in our equipment supply chain relating to public health pandemics
 such as COVID-19
 trade wars or other factors)
 and we may not succeed in increasing our net revenue and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. We have incurred significant expenses in connection with investing in our egg processing facility
 our co-manufacturing and co-packing relationships
 and obtaining and storing raw materials
 and we will continue to incur significant expenses in developing our innovative products and marketing the products we offer. In addition
 many of our expenses
 including the costs associated with our existing and any future processing and manufacturing facilities
 are fixed. We also expect to incur significant additional legal
 accounting and other expenses as a public company that we did not incur as a private company. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue at a greater rate than our costs and expenses
 we may be unable to maintain or increase our profitability and may incur losses in the future. 

 which makes it difficult to forecast our future results of operations. 

 our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties
 including our ability to plan for and model future growth. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further
 in future periods
 our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons
 including slowing demand for our products
 increasing competition
 a decrease in the growth of our overall market
 or our failure
 for any reason
 to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change
 or if we do not address these risks successfully
 our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations
 and our business could suffer. 


 the technical capability of our innovation staff in developing and testing product prototypes
 our ability to comply with applicable governmental regulations
 and the success of our management and sales and marketing teams in introducing and marketing new products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market new products that appeal to consumers. For example
 prior to our launch of egg bites in August 2020
 it took us longer than expected to finalize the packaging of this new product line
 which impacted the timing of our product launch at certain retailers. Any failure to develop
 market and launch future products may lead to a decrease in our growth
 sales and profitability. 

 the development and introduction of new products requires substantial marketing expenditures
 which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our objectives with respect to new or improved products
 our business could be harmed.

 other unanticipated costs may arise. 


We expect that our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses
equirements and debt service payments through at least the next 12 months. However
 our operating plan may change because of factors currently unknown to us

 and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of customers covered by our market opportunity estimates will purchase our products at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors
 including the cost and perceived value associated with our product and those of our competitors. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecast
 our business could fail to grow at the rate we anticipate

 has announced that it intends to stop one week and two month U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates after 2021 with remaining U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates ceasing to be published on June 30
 2023. In the United States
 the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate
 or SOFR
 as an alternative to LIBOR. It is not presently known whether SOFR or any other alternative reference rates that have been proposed will attain market acceptance as replacements of LIBOR. In addition
 the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such phase-out and selection of an alternative reference rate
 together with disruption in the financial markets
 could negatively impact the interest expenses associated with any future borrowings under the Credit Facility and could cause our available cash flow and/or financial condition to be adversely affected.

 including recently
 there has been an oversupply of eggs
 which has caused egg prices to contract

 financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. 

 and when prices for commodity shell eggs fall relative to the price of our pasture-raised shell eggs
 price-sensitive consumers may choose to purchase commodity shell eggs offered by our competitors at a greater velocity than
 or instead of
 our pasture-raised eggs. As a result
 low commodity shell egg prices may adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 which fluctuate widely and are outside our control. Small increases in production
 or small decreases in demand
 can have a large adverse effect on the prices at which these eggs are sold. 


shell eggs contribute the vast majority of our net revenue
 and a reduction in these sales would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 

 90% of our net revenue in fiscal 2019 and 90% of our net revenue in fiscal 2020. Pasture-raised shell eggs are our flagship product and have been the focal point of our sales and marketing efforts
 and we believe that sales of pasture-raised shell eggs will continue to constitute a significant portion of our net revenue
 net income and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to expand sales
 processing and distribution of pasture-raised shell eggs
 or that consumer and customer demand for our other existing and future products will expand to allow such products to represent a larger percentage of our revenue than they do currently. Accordingly
 any factor adversely affecting sales of our pasture-raised shell eggs could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 


 and under our buy-sell contracts
 which account for 98% of the laying hens in our network of family farms as of December 27
 2020
 the price we pay is also indexed quarterly in arrears for changes in feed cost
 which may cause our agreed-upon pricing under these contracts to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Additionally
 for our integrator contracts
 which account for the remaining 2% of laying hens in our network
 we are directly responsible for purchasing and providing feed supply to the farmer. Therefore
 our results of operations and financial condition
 including our gross margin and profitability
 fluctuate based on the cost and supply of commodities
 including corn
 soybean meal and other feed ingredients. 

 we have little
 if any
 control over the prices of these ingredients
 which are affected by weather
 speculators
 export restrictions
 various supply and demand factors
 transportation and storage costs
 and agricultural and energy policies in the United States and internationally. For example
 the severe drought in the summer of 2012 and resulting damage to corn and soybean crops resulted in high and volatile feed costs. 

 or the pricing postures of our competitors and
 in many cases
 our retailers may not accept a price increase or may require price increases to occur after a specified period of time elapses. In addition
 if we increase prices to offset higher costs
 we could experience lower demand for our products and lower sales volumes. Over time
 if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs
 unable to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or unsuccessful in any commodity-hedging program
 then commodity price volatility or increases could adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 manufacturing and production capacity as we continue to grow and scale our business
 our business and operating results and our brand reputation could be harmed. 

 processing and manufacturing capabilities are sufficient to meet our present business needs
 we may need to expand these capabilities in the future as we continue to grow and scale our business. For example
 we are in the process of expanding Egg Central Station
 our shell egg processing facility
 to increase our capacity for the distribution of pasture-raised shell eggs. However
 there is risk in our ability to effectively scale production and processing and effectively manage our supply chain requirements. We must accurately forecast demand for our products in order to ensure we have adequate processing and manufacturing capacity to effectively allocate product supply across our stock keeping units
 or SKUs.

 which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand. 

 as a result
 consumers who have previously purchased our products buy other brands or our retailers allocate shelf space to other brands
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

 if we overestimate our demand (in general or on a particular SKU) or overbuild our capacity relative to distribution
 we may have significantly underutilized supply or other assets and may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our processing and manufacturing capabilities with demand
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 


We are currently expanding Egg Central Station
tion of or commence operations in this expansion
 or the expanded facility may not operate in accordance with our expectations. 

 we commenced design of an expansion of Egg Central Station
 our shell egg processing facility
 in order to address our rapid growth and increase our shell egg processing capacity. Constructing and opening this facility has required
 and will continue to require
 significant capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel
 which has and will continue to divert resources from our existing business or operations. In addition
 we will need to hire and retain more skilled crew members to operate the expanded facility. Even if our expansion is brought up to full processing capacity
 it may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. 

 our business
 operating results and brand reputation could be harmed. 

 which is the foundation of our supply chain. If we are unable to maintain and expand this supply chain because of actions taken by farmers or other events outside of our control
 we may be unable to timely supply distributors and customers with our products
 which could lead to cancellation of purchase orders
 damage to our commercial relationships and impairment of our brand. For example
 we require these farmers to build and equip their farms to certain specifications
 which requires a significant upfront capital investment
 and any inability of farmers to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms would impair their ability to partner with us. If our relationship with these farmers is disrupted
 we may not be able to fully recover our investments in birds and feed
 which would negatively impact our operating results. There are a number of factors that could impair our relationship with farmers
 many of which are outside of our control. For example
 while we strive to operate our business in a manner that drives long-term and sustainable benefits for our stakeholders
 including farmers
 we may make strategic decisions that the farmers do not believe align with their interests or values
 which could cause the farmers to terminate their relationships with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any failure to maintain or expand our network of small family farms would adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by reduced or limited availability of pasture-raised eggs and milk and other raw materials that meet our standards. 
Our ability to ensure a continuing supply of pasture-raised eggs and milk and other raw materials for our products at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control. In particular
 we rely on the farms that supply us with pasture-raised eggs and milk to implement controls and procedures to manage the risk of exposing animals to harmful diseases
 but outbreaks may occur despite their efforts. An outbreak of disease could result in increased government restriction on the sale and distribution of our products
 and negative publicity could impact customer and consumer perception of our products
 even if an outbreak does not directly impact the animals from which we source our products. Our network of small family farms is in a geographic region we refer to as the Pasture Belt
 which is a term we use that refers to the U.S. region
 including Arkansas and Georgia
 and portions of Alabama
 Illinois
 Kansas
 Kentucky
 Mississippi
 Missouri
 Oklahoma
 North Carolina
 South Carolina
 Tennessee and Texas
 where pasture-raised eggs can be produced year-round. The occurrence of a natural disaster in this region could have a significant negative impact on us
 the farmers and our supply chain. Additionally
 the animals from which our products are sourced
 and the pastures on which they are raised
 are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters
 such as floods
 droughts
 frosts
 earthquakes
 hurricanes and pestilence. Disease
 adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can adversely impact pasture quantity and quality
 leading to reduced egg and milk yields and quality
 which in turn could reduce the available supply of
 or increase the price of
 our raw materials.
We also compete with other food companies in the procurement of pasture-raised eggs and milk
 and this competition may increase in the future if consumer demand increases for these items or products containing them or if competitors increasingly offer products in these market sectors. If supplies of pasture-raised eggs and milk that meet our quality standards are reduced or are in greater demand
 we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply to meet our needs on favorable terms
 or at all. For example
 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
 there have been recent disruptions in the U.S. pasture-raised milk supply
 including significant drops in prices and demand
 which have resulted in the loss of suppliers. While we have worked with our co-manufacturers to mitigate these supply disruptions
 and as a result there has been no impact on our ability to fill customer orders for our pasture-raised butter or ghee products
 we expect that these supply disruptions will continue for the foreseeable future and that they may be further exacerbated by the ongoing effects of COVID-19
 which could impact our ability to fill customer orders in the future. 

 changes in U.S. and global economic conditions
 and our ability to forecast our raw materials requirements. For example
 the farms must meet our standards and in order to meet these standards
 we require them to invest in infrastructure at the outset of our relationship. The typical upfront investment for each of the farms is significant and many of the farmers seek financing assistance from local and regional banks as well as federal government loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
 or USDA
 Farm Service Agency. Changes in U.S. and global economic conditions or any U.S. government shutdown (including in connection with COVID-19) could significantly decrease loans available to farmers. Many of these farmers also have alternative income opportunities and the relative financial performance of raising chickens and cows on pasture as compared to other potentially more profitable opportunities could affect their interest in working with us. Any of these factors could impact our ability to supply our products to distributors and customers and may adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 



s derived from products manufactured at facilities owned and operated by our co-manufacturers. We currently rely on two co-manufacturers for hard-boiled eggs
 one co-manufacturer for butter
 one co-manufacturer for ghee
 one co-manufacturer for liquid eggs and one co-manufacturer for egg bites. While we currently have written manufacturing contracts with our co-manufacturers for butter and egg bites
 we do not have written manufacturing contracts with our other co-manufacturers. Due to the absence of written contracts with a majority of our co-manufacturers
 certain of our co-manufacturers can generally seek to alter or terminate their relationships with us at any time
 leaving us with periods during which we have limited or no ability to manufacture our products.

 postpone or reduce production of some of our products
 which could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations until such time as the interruption is resolved or an alternate source of production is secured
 especially in times of low inventory. 

 high-quality co-manufacturers in our industry that meet our geographical requirements and our strict quality and control standards
 and should we seek to obtain additional or alternative co-manufacturing arrangements in the future
 there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms
 in a timely manner
 or at all. Therefore
 the loss of one or more co-manufacturers
 any disruption or delay at a co-manufacturer or any failure to identify and engage co-manufacturers for new products and product extensions could delay
 postpone or reduce production of our products
 which could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 perception and spending habits in the natural food industry and on animal-based products
 in particular
 and failure to develop or enrich our product offering or gain market acceptance of our new products could have a negative effect on our business. 

 clean-label
 traceable
 ethically produced
 great-tasting and nutritious foods. The market in which we operate is subject to changes in consumer preference
 perception and spending habits. Our performance depends significantly on factors that may affect the level and pattern of consumer spending in the U.S. natural food industry market in which we operate. Such factors include consumer preference
 consumer confidence
 consumer income
 consumer perception of the safety and quality of our products and shifts in the perceived value for our products relative to alternatives. Media coverage regarding the safety or quality of
 or diet or health issues relating to
 our products or the raw materials
 ingredients or processes involved in their manufacturing may damage consumer confidence in our products. A general decline in the consumption of our products could occur at any time as a result of change in consumer preference
 perception
 confidence and spending habits
 including an unwillingness to pay a premium or an inability to purchase our products due to financial hardship or increased price sensitivity
 which may be exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example
 we and many of our customers face pressure from animal rights groups to require all companies that supply food products to operate their business in a manner that treats animals in conformity with certain standards developed or approved by these animal rights groups. If consumer preferences shift away from animal-based products for these reasons
 because of a preference for plant-based products or otherwise
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

 our ability to differentiate the quality of our products from those of our competitors
 and the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns for our products. We may not be successful in identifying trends in consumer preferences and developing products that respond to such trends in a timely manner. We also may not be able to effectively promote our products by our marketing and advertising campaigns and gain market acceptance. If our products fail to gain market acceptance
 are restricted by regulatory requirements or have quality problems
 we may not be able to fully recover costs and expenses incurred in our operation
 and our business
 financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

 and the loss of one or more distributor relationships that cannot be replaced in a timely manner may adversely affect our results of operations. 
Our products are distributed to a broker-distributor-retailer network whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers who in turn sell our products to consumers. We serve the majority of natural channel customers through food distributors
 such as United Natural Foods
 Inc.
 or UNFI
 KeHE Distributors
 LLC
 or KeHE
 and US Foods
 Inc.
 or US Foods
 which purchase
 store
 sell and deliver our products to retailers
 2018
 2019 and 2020
 UNFI (which was Whole Foods&#8217; distributor through March 2020) accounted for approximately 36%
 35% and 15% of our net revenue
 respectively
 KeHE accounted for approximately 10%
 11% and 12% of our net revenue
 respectively
 and US Foods (which became Whole Foods&#8217; distributor in April 2020) accounted for approximately 0%
 0%
 and 18% of our net revenue
 respectively. Since these distributors act as intermediaries between us and the retail grocers or foodservice providers
 who generally select the distributors
 we do not have short-term or long-term commitments or minimum purchase volumes in our contracts with distributors that ensure future sales of our products. These distributors are able to decide on the products carried
 and they may limit the products available for retailers
 such as Whole Foods and Sprouts
 to purchase. We expect that most of our sales will be made through a core number of distributors for the foreseeable future. The loss of one or more of our significant distributor relationships that cannot be replaced in a timely manner (or at all) could adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 


with laying hens. Any disruption in that supply chain could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition or results of operations. 

 while we do not own laying hens
 we are generally responsible for coordinating the acquisition and delivery of laying hens to the farmers. In order to meet these obligations
 we place orders for chicks directly with hatcheries intended to supply a future year&#8217;s production of eggs at least a year in advance. Once the chicks are hatched
 they are delivered to a network of pullet farms
 who rear the chicks to approximately 16 to 18 weeks of age
 at which time they begin laying eggs. The hens are then delivered directly from the pullet farms to our network of family farms
 which then place the hens into egg production. 

 we currently work with a sole source supplier that contracts with a network of independent pullet farms. 

 and if this supplier were to cease doing business with us for any reason
 we may have a difficult time finding and contracting with alternate pullet farms in sufficient scale to meet our needs
 if at all. Additionally
 any disruption in these supply services for any reason
 including bird disease
 natural disaster
 fire
 power interruption
 work stoppage or other calamity
 could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations if we cannot replace these providers in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all. 


 which have been undergoing a consolidation in recent years. This consolidation has produced larger
 more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases
 as well as operate with lower inventories
 decrease the number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private label products
 all of which could negatively impact our business. During fiscal years 2018
 2019 and 2020
 our largest direct retail customer accounted for approximately 14%
 14% and 13% of our net revenue
 respectively. 

 like Whole Foods and Sprouts
 we sell our products through distributors. We are not able to precisely attribute our net revenue to a specific retailer for products sold through distributors. We rely on third-party data to calculate the portion of retail sales attributable to retailers
 but this data is inherently imprecise because it is based on gross sales generated by our products sold at retailers
 without accounting for price concessions
 promotional activities or chargebacks
 and because it measures retail sales for only the portion of our retailers serviced through distributors. Based on this third-party data and internal analysis
 Whole Foods accounted for approximately 31%
 30% and 28% of our retail sales in fiscal years 2018
 2019 and 2020
 respectively
 and Sprouts accounted for approximately 8%
 8% and 7% of our retail sales in fiscal years 2018
 2019 and 2020
 respectively.&#160;The loss of Kroger
 Whole Foods
 Sprouts or any other large retail customer
 the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from Kroger
 Whole Foods
 Sprouts or any other large retail customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profitability. 

 such as their financial condition
 changes in their business strategy or operations
 the introduction of competing products or the perceived quality of our products. Despite operating in different channel segments
 our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition
 retailers may take actions that negatively affect us. Consequently
 our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the actions of one or more significant retailers. 

 in compliance with applicable governmental regulations or at all
 could result in lost sales. 

 including increases in fuel prices
 which would increase our shipping costs
 chronic driver shortages
 employee strikes or unavailability (including due to COVID-19)
 inclement weather and noncompliance by our third-party transportation providers with applicable regulatory requirements
 which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. We may change shipping companies
 and we could face logistical difficulties with any such change that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition
 we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover
 we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third-party transportation providers that we currently use
 which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our operating results. 




 including as a result of interruptions to global shipping
 could delay our production and hinder our ability to meet our commitments to customers. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of our packaging on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner
 or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources
 sales of our products could be delayed or we may be required to redesign our products. For example
 in connection with increased demand for shell eggs in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic
 the supplier of substantially all of our shell egg cartons began to prioritize packaging for core egg products (such as 12-count packages)
 and we separately experienced certain quality issues with our 18-count egg cartons. As a result of these events
 and in order to otherwise meet demand for our products
 we began using recycled plastic packaging for a small number of our shell egg products. While this change in packaging did not materially impact our operations
 there is no guarantee that we will not experience similar packaging issues in the future
 or that any such packaging issues will not impact our ability to meet product demand for our shell eggs. Any of these events could result in lost sales
 reduced gross margins or damage to our customer relationships
 which would have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 we may not be able to maintain manufacturing and storage capacity at the times and with the capacities necessary to produce and store our products or meet the demand for our products. 

 one co-manufacturer for butter
 one co-manufacturer for ghee
 one co-manufacturer for liquid eggs and one co-manufacturer for egg bites. Our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to obtain adequate co-manufacturing and cold storage facilities services in a timely manner. We are not assured of continued co-manufacturing and cold storage capacities. Certain of our co-manufacturers or our cold storage providers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with us. In addition
 we are not assured of sufficient capacities of these providers commensurate with increased product demand. 

 in December 2019
 our co-manufacturer for hard-boiled eggs conducted a voluntary Class&#160;I recall of all hard-boiled eggs produced at its facility
 including ours
 due to a potential listeria contamination at the production facility. In connection with the recall
 our co-manufacturer elected to permanently close the affected production facility and move all production to a different facility
 which did not have sufficient capacity to meet product demand. As a result we were unable to supply customers with hard-boiled eggs for a period of time in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This disruption led to the loss of certain customer accounts for this product
 the revenues from which were immaterial in the aggregate. Our co-manufacturers are currently able to meet our product demand for hard-boiled eggs due to the effects of COVID-19 on the foodservice industry. However
 we may experience supply issues once the foodservice industry returns to full capacity
 which may lead to additional loss of customers. 


 including producers of private-label products
 as well as producers of other branded egg and butter products that compete for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. Numerous brands and products compete for limited retailer shelf space
 including in the refrigerated section

 among other things
 product quality and taste
 brand recognition and loyalty
 product variety
 product packaging and package design

 advertising
 promotion and nutritional claims. 

 Inc. and large international food companies such as Ornua (Kerrygold). We also compete directly with local and regional egg companies
 as well as private-label specialty egg products processed by other egg companies. Each of these competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and some of whose products are well accepted in the marketplace today. They may also have lower operational costs
 and as a result may be able to offer comparable or substitute products to customers at lower costs. This could put pressure on us to lower our prices
 resulting in lower profitability or
 in the alternative
 cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices. 

 the food industry is dominated by multinational corporations with substantially greater resources and operations than us. We cannot be certain that we will successfully compete with larger competitors that have greater financial
 sales and technical resources. Conventional food companies may acquire our competitors or launch their own egg and butter products
 including ones that may be pasture-raised
 and they may be able to use their resources and scale to respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products
 reducing prices or increasing promotional activities
 among other things. Retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels
 which are generally sold at lower prices
 and may change the merchandising of our products so they have less favorable placement. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause us to lose market share
 which may require us to lower prices
 increase marketing and advertising expenditures
 or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns
 each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability. 


Further
may be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than we are. In connection with the pandemic
 we have restricted employee travel
 cancelled certain events with consumers
 customers or partners
d access to our headquarters. Although we are monitoring the situation
 we cannot predict for how long
 or the ultimate extent to which
 the pandemic may disrupt our operations as a result of these measures or if we are required to implement other changes
sume normal business operations or shift to other third-party vendors
 negatively affecting our revenue and other financial results. A prolonged disruption of our business could also damage our reputation. 

 our ability to compete successfully in our market depends
 in large part
 on our ability to implement our growth strategy of expanding supply and distribution
 improving placement of our products
 attracting new consumers to our brand and introducing new products and product extensions. Our ability to implement this growth strategy depends
 among other things
 on our ability to:

 real or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements

 such as salmonella and E. coli. These organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more could be present in our products
 either as a result of food processing or as an inherent risk based on the nature of our products. These organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further-processing
 foodservice or consumer level. These risks may be controlled
 but may not be eliminated
 by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing. Shipment of contaminated products
 even if inadvertent
 could result in a violation of law and lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims
 product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies
 penalties and adverse publicity. In addition
 products purchased from other producers
 including co-manufacturers
 could contain contaminants that we might inadvertently redistribute.

 or if there is a potential health risk associated with our products
 we or our co-manufacturers might decide or need to recall a product. Any product recall could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products and adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers. For example
 in December 2019
 our co-manufacturer for hard-boiled eggs conducted a voluntary Class&#160;I recall of all hard-boiled eggs produced at its facility
 including ours
 due to potential listeria contamination at the production facility. In connection with the recall
 our co-manufacturer elected to permanently close the affected production facility and move all production to a different facility. As a result
 we were unable to supply customers with hard-boiled eggs for a period of time in the first quarter of fiscal 2020
 which led to the loss of certain customer accounts for this product
 the revenues from which were immaterial in the aggregate. 

 consumers may store our products under conditions and for periods of time inconsistent with USDA
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 or FDA
 and other governmental guidelines
 which may adversely affect the quality and safety of our products. 


If consumers do not perceive our products to be of high quality or safe
e value of our brand would be diminished
 and our business

 pasture-raised products and may significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any of our products
egardless of the cause
 may have an adverse effect on our brand
 reputation and operating results. Further
 the growing use of social and digital media by us

 as well as other factors beyond our control
 such as natural disaster
 fire
 power interruption
 work stoppage
 disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19)
 equipment failure or delay in raw materials delivery
 would significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner
 meet our contractual obligations and operate our business. Further
 the processing equipment used for our pasture-raised shell eggs is costly to replace or repair
 particularly because certain of our processing equipment is sourced internationally
 and our equipment supply chains may be disrupted in connection with pandemics
 such as COVID-19
 trade wars or other factors. If any material amount of our machinery were damaged
 we would be unable to predict when
 if at all
 we could replace or repair such machinery or find co-manufacturers with suitable alternative machinery
 which could adversely affect our business
 financial condition and operating results. We have property and business disruption insurance in place for Egg Central Station; however
 such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms
 or at all. 

 especially during economic downturn
 may adversely affect our profitability. 

 we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products
 but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices. Consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in perceived value between our brands and private label products narrows
 or if there is a perception of such a narrowing
 consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us. We believe that in periods of economic uncertainty
 such as the current economic uncertainty surrounding COVID-19
 consumers may purchase more lower-priced private label or other economy brands. To the extent this occurs
 we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition
 our foodservice product sales will be reduced if consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers
 whether as a result of restaurant closures or government-ordered quarantines
 travel restrictions or other social distancing directives in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic
 or in other times of economic uncertainty. 

 build brand loyalty and generate interest in our products. Our marketing strategies and channels will evolve and our programs may or may not be successful. 

 we may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending to maintain and increase consumer awareness
 protect and grow our existing market share or promote new products
 which could impact our operating results. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures may be required to maintain or improve our brand&#8217;s market position or to introduce new products to the market
 and participants in our industry are increasingly engaging with non-traditional media
 including consumer outreach through social media and web-based channels
 which may not prove successful. 

 social media platforms frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user&#8217;s search and may make other changes to the way results are displayed
 or may increase the costs of such advertising
 which can negatively affect the placement of our links and
 therefore
 reduce the number of visits to our website and social media channels or make such marketing cost-prohibitive. In addition
 social media platforms typically require compliance with their policies and procedures
 which may be subject to change or new interpretation with limited ability to negotiate
 which could negatively impact our marketing capabilities. If we are unable to maintain and promote a favorable perception of our brand and products on a cost-effective basis
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 


nd
 our business could suffer. 

 and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of the Vital Farms brand. Maintaining
 promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on
 among other factors
 the success of our product offerings
 food safety
 quality assurance
 marketing and merchandising efforts
 our continued focus on animal welfare
 the environment and sustainability and our ability to provide a consistent
 high-quality consumer and customer experience. Any negative publicity
 regardless of its accuracy
 could have an adverse effect on our business. Brand value is based on perceptions of subjective qualities
 and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our consumers
 customers
 suppliers or co-manufacturers
 including changes to our products or packaging
 adverse publicity or a governmental investigation
 litigation or regulatory enforcement action
 could significantly reduce the value of our brand and significantly damage our business. 

 our business could be adversely affected. 

 and our ability to increase revenue and operate profitably
 depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new consumers
 retain existing consumers and keep existing consumers engaged so that they continue to purchase our products. While we intend to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing to educate consumers about our brand
 our values and our products
 there is no assurance that these efforts will generate further demand for our products or expand our consumer base. Our ability to attract new consumers and retain our existing consumers will depend on the perceived value and quality of our products
 consumers&#8217; desire to purchase ethically produced products at a premium
 offerings of our competitors
 our ability to offer new and relevant products and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts
 among other items. For example
 because our pasture-raised shell eggs are sold to consumers at a premium price point
 when prices for commodity shell eggs fall relative to the price of our pasture-raised shell eggs
 we may be unable to entice price-sensitive consumers to try our products. We may also lose loyal consumers to our competitors if we are unable to meet consumer demand in a timely manner. If we are unable to cost-effectively acquire new consumers
 retain existing consumers and keep existing consumers engaged
 our business
 financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. 


 to expand the number of products sold through existing retail customers
 to grow within the foodservice channel and to strengthen our product offerings through innovation in both new and existing categories. Any strategies we employ to pursue this growth are subject to numerous factors outside of our control. For example
 retailers continue to aggressively market their private label products
 which could reduce demand for our products. The expansion of our business also depends on our ability over the long term to obtain customers in additional distribution channels
 such as convenience
 drugstore
 club
 military and international markets. Any growth in distribution channels may also affect our existing customer relationships and present additional challenges
 including related to pricing strategies. Additionally
 we may need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing and promotional activities
 such as rebates
 temporary price reductions
 off-invoice discounts
 retailer advertisements
 product coupons and other trade activities
 and these expenditures are subject to risks
 including related to consumer acceptance of our efforts. Our failure to obtain new customers
 or expand our business with existing customers
 could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows. 


 particularly Thanksgiving
 Christmas and Easter
 and the lowest during the summer months. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations
 comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons. If we are not correct in predicting our future shell egg demand
 we may experience a supply and demand shell egg imbalance. This imbalance between supply and demand can adversely impact our results of operations at certain times of the year. 

 which may negatively impact our profitability
 and any reduced availability of packaging supplies may otherwise impact our business. 
We and our co-manufacturers purchase and use significant quantities of cardboard
 glass
 corrugated fiberboard
 kraft paper
 flexible plastic
 flexible film and paperboard to package our products. Costs of packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict
 including global competition for resources
 weather conditions
 consumer demand and changes in governmental trade. Volatility in the prices of supplies we and our co-manufacturers purchase could increase our cost of sales and reduce our profitability. Moreover
 we may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs
 and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes. Additionally
 if the availability of certain packaging supplies is limited due to factors beyond our control (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic)
 or if packaging supplies do not meet our standards
 we may make changes to our product packaging
 which could negatively impact the perception of our brand. For example
 in connection with increased demand for shell eggs in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic
 the supplier of substantially all 


of our shell egg cartons began to prioritize packaging for core egg products (such as 12-count packages)
issues with our 18-count egg cartons. As a result of these events

 and if we are not able to attract and retain a profitable customer mix and a profitable product mix
 our profitability could continue to be adversely affected. 

 we periodically offer sales incentives through various programs to customers and consumers
 including rebates
 temporary price reductions
 off-invoice discounts
 retailer advertisements
 product coupons and other trade activities. We also periodically provide chargebacks to our customers
 which include credits or discounts to customers in the event that products do not conform to customer specifications or expire at a customer&#8217;s site. The cost associated with promotions and chargebacks is estimated and recorded as a reduction in net revenue. We anticipate that these price concessions and promotional activities could adversely impact our net revenue and that changes in such activities could adversely impact period-over-period results. If we are not correct in predicting the performance of such promotions
 or if we are not correct in estimating chargebacks
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

 there may be changes in our executive management team or other key crew members resulting from the hiring or departure of these personnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers
 or the failure by our executive team to effectively work with our crew members and lead our company
 could harm our business. 

 our success depends in part upon our ability to attract
 train
 develop and retain a sufficient number of crew members who understand and appreciate our culture and can represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. If we are unable to win in a competitive market for top talent capable of meeting our business needs and expectations
 our business and brand image may be impaired. For example
 in Springfield
 Missouri
 where Egg Central Station in located
 there is a tight labor market. As a result of this tight labor market
 we may be unable to attract and retain crew members with the skills we require. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our crew members may adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 our success and our business and competitive position may be harmed. 

 which is critical to our growth
 and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow and develop the infrastructure of a public company
 we may find it difficult to maintain these important values. If we fail to maintain our company culture or focus on our purpose our business and competitive position may be harmed. 


 our shell egg processing facility
 is located in Springfield
 Missouri. This facility and our network of small family farms are concentrated in the Midwestern portion of the Pasture Belt. The pasture-raised milk for our butter is sourced from two separate and distinct geographical areas
 one area in the Midwest and one area in the Southeast. This supply encompasses a total of approximately 40 farms. Butter is manufactured in close proximity to the Midwest farm supply. The impact of natural disasters such as tornadoes
 drought or flood within these areas is difficult to predict
 but such a natural disaster could seriously disrupt our entire business. Our insurance may not adequately cover our losses and expenses in the event of such a natural disaster. As a result
 natural disasters within these areas could lead to substantial losses. 




 any claim under our insurance policies may be subject to certain exceptions
 may not be honored fully
 in a timely manner
 or at all
 and we may not have purchased sufficient insurance to cover all losses incurred. If we were to incur substantial liabilities or if our business operations were interrupted for a substantial period of time
 we could incur costs and suffer losses. Such inventory and business interruption losses may not be covered by our insurance policies. We also expect that as a newly public company
 it will be more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance than when we operated as a private company
 and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result
 it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors
 our board committees or as executive officers. We do not know
 however
 if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts
 which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations. Additionally
 in the future
 insurance coverage may not be available to us at commercially acceptable premiums
 or at all.

 or there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of these or any other measures to contain or treat COVID-19
 there is likely to be an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending

 including interruptions to global shipping that may impact our and our suppliers&#8217; ability to access equipment and other materials
 continue for an extended period of time
 our ability to meet the demands of our customers or to expand as planned may be materially impacted.  Additionally
 while Egg Central Station

 COVID-19 may impact customer and consumer demand. Retail and grocery stores may be impacted if governments continue to implement regional business closures
 quarantines
 travel restrictions and other social distancing directives to slow the spread of the virus. Further
 to the extent our customers&#8217; operations are negatively impacted
 our customers may reduce demand for or spending on our products
 or customers or distributors may delay payments to us or request payment or other concessions. There may also be significant reductions or volatility in consumer demand for our products due to travel restrictions or social distancing directives
 as well as the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness
 quarantine or financial hardship
 shifts in demand away from one or more of our products
 decreased consumer confidence and spending or pantry-loading activity
 any of which may negatively impact our results
 including as a result of an increased difficulty in planning for operations. Additionally
 we may be unable to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer viewing and shopping habits due to event cancellations
 reduced in-store visits and travel restrictions
 among other things. Further
 governmental restrictions on the movement of people
 public gatherings and businesses are likely to result in fewer people eating out and greater numbers of restaurant closures
 both of which would negatively affect our foodservice business.

The partial shutdown also impacted our ability to receive governmental approvals for products and labeling of new products. Another U.S. federal government shutdown of similar or greater duration could similarly impact our business
 which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 




 the concentration of these farms allows for efficient transportation of pasture-raised eggs to Egg Central Station and of pasture-raised milk to our butter and ghee co-manufacturing facilities. However
 there is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures
 weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate change has a negative effect on the year-round habitability of the region for chickens and cows
 we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for pasture-raised eggs and milk. Even if eggs and milk are available from other regions
 they may not be pasture-raised due to certain regional weather conditions not being conducive to pasture raising. We may also incur increased transportation
 storage and processing costs if we are unable to source pasture-raised eggs and milk within a certain distance from Egg Central Station and co-manufacturing facilities.

 foodservice consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns. In particular
 consumers may reduce the amount of pasture-raised products that they purchase where there are more affordable products
 including caged
 cage-free and free-range egg and egg product offerings
 which generally have lower retail prices than our pasture-raised eggs. In addition
 consumers may choose to purchase private label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. Further
 our foodservice product sales will be reduced if consumers reduce the amount of food they consume away from home at our foodservice customers
 whether as a result of restaurant closures or government-ordered quarantines
 travel restrictions and other social distancing directives in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic
 or in other times of economic uncertainty. Distributors and customers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon

 could result in the disruption or discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationships with such suppliers
 or otherwise result in increased operating costs

 in December 2019
 our co-manufacturer for hard-boiled eggs conducted a voluntary Class&#160;I recall of all hard-boiled eggs produced at its facility
 including ours
 due to a potential listeria contamination at the production facility. Our co-manufacturer elected to permanently close the affected production facility and move all production to a different facility
 which did not have sufficient capacity to meet product demand. As a result we were unable to supply customers with hard-boiled eggs for a period of time in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our co-manufacturers are currently able to meet our product demand for hard-boiled eggs due to the effects of COVID-19 on the foodservice industry. However
 we may experience supply issues once the foodservice industry returns to full capacity
 which may lead to additional loss of customers.

 the FDA and the USDA split jurisdiction depending on the type of product involved. While the FDA has primary responsibility for the regulation of shell eggs
 the USDA has primary responsibility for the regulation of dried
 frozen or liquid eggs and other &#8220;egg products
&#8221; subject to certain exceptions. Specifically
 our shell eggs
 butter
 hard-boiled eggs
 ghee and egg bite products are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act
 as amended
 or the FDCA
 and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs
 among other things
 the manufacturing
 composition and ingredients
 packaging
 labeling and safety of most food products. The FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements
 including hazard analysis and preventative controls regulations
 current good manufacturing practices
 or cGMPs
 and supplier verification requirements. Our shell egg operations are further subject to FDA regulatory requirements governing the production
 storage and transportation of shell eggs for the control of salmonella. FDA-inspected processing facilities are subject to periodic and &#8220;for cause&#8221; inspection by federal
 state and local authorities. In addition
 certain of our products
 such as our liquid whole egg and certain of our egg bite products
 are subject to regulation by the USDA
 including facility registration

 in December 2019
 our co-manufacturer for hard-boiled eggs conducted a voluntary Class&#160;I recall of all hard-boiled eggs produced at its facility
 including ours
 due to a potential listeria contamination at the production facility. We rely upon our co-manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control

 establishments that manufacture egg products must comply with the USDA&#8217;s requirements for sanitation
 temperature control
 pasteurization and labeling. In addition
 in September 2020
 the USDA announced that it had finalized its Egg Products Inspection Rule. Pursuant to the regulatory requirements established by this rule
 we anticipate that our co-manufacturers&#8217; liquid whole egg establishment will be required to implement Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point plans within two years after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register
 and will further be required to implement Sanitary Standard Operating Procedures within one year after publication in the Federal Register. Certain of our egg bite products that contain bacon and ham are also subject to USDA regulation
 pursuant to the Federal Meat Inspection Act
 or FMIA. The FMIA and USDA regulations establish registration

 our co-manufacturers for compliance with USDA regulations for the manufacturing of our liquid egg and egg bite products that is conducted by our co-manufacturers. If we or our co-manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture liquid whole eggs or egg bites that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the USDA or others
 we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions

 and our network of family farms and co-manufacturers
 contract with NOP-accredited certifying agents to ensure that our organic products are produced in compliance with the OFPA and NOP regulations. We do not control the farms where our products are raised and rely on the farms for compliance with the on-farm requirements of the OFPA and NOP regulations. Similarly
 we do not control the manufacturing processes of

 our co-manufacturers for compliance with requirements of the OFPA and NOP regulations with respect to organic products handled and manufactured by our co-manufacturers. If we
 the farms or the co-manufacturers cannot successfully raise and manufacture products that meet the strict regulatory requirements of the OFPA and the NOP
 we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions

 the State of Iowa requires that grocery stores which participate in the Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women
 Infants
 and Children
 and which sell eggs produced by chickens advertised as being housed in cage-free
 free-range or enriched colony cage environments
 also sell &#8220;conventional&#8221; eggs produced by chickens that are not so advertised. That regulation impacted the space allocation for non-caged eggs on the shelves of retailers in Iowa and their willingness to carry our eggs. In addition
 one or more states could pass regulations that establish requirements that our products would not satisfy. If our products fail to meet such individual state standards or are restricted from being imported into a state by state regulatory requirements

 the farms and co-manufacturers are required to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our standards and specifications. In the event of actual or alleged non-compliance
 we might be forced to find alternative farms

 we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate
 if possible
 the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates
 we may establish reserves
 as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. We are not currently party to any material litigation. 


Even when not merited

 including particularly those affected by the specific benefit purposes set forth in our certificate of incorporation. In addition
 there is no assurance that the expected positive impact from being a public benefit corporation will be realized. Accordingly
 being a public benefit corporation and complying with our related obligations could negatively impact our ability to provide the highest possible return to our stockholders. 

 we are required to disclose to stockholders a report at least biennially on our overall public benefit performance and on our assessment of our success in achieving our specific public benefit purpose. If we are not timely or are unable to provide this report
 or if the report is not viewed favorably by parties doing business with us or regulators or others reviewing our credentials
 our reputation and status as a public benefit corporation may be harmed. 

 we have elected to have our social and environmental performance
 accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment
 we have been designated as a &#8220;Certified B Corporation
&#8221; which refers to companies that are certified as meeting certain levels of social and environmental performance
 accountability and transparency. The standards for Certified B Corporation certification are set by an independent organization
 B Lab
 and may change over time
 and our continued certification is at the sole discretion of B Lab. To maintain our certification
 we are required to update our assessment and verify our updated score with B Lab every three years. We were most recently recertified in February 2018 and are in the process of our second recertification with B Lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were randomly selected for an onsite review
 which is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Certified B Corporation designation remains in good standing while we conduct the recertification process
 but there is no guarantee that we will be recertified. Our reputation could be harmed if we lose our status as a Certified B Corporation
 whether by our choice or by our failure to continue to meet the certification requirements
 if that failure or change were to create a perception that we are more focused on financial performance and are no longer as committed to the values shared by Certified B Corporations. Likewise
 our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported Certified B Corporation score declines. 

 our duty to balance a variety of interests may result in actions that do not maximize stockholder value. 

 our board of directors has a duty to balance (i)&#160;the pecuniary interest of our stockholders
 (ii)&#160;the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct and (iii)&#160;specific public benefits identified in our charter documents. While we believe our public benefit designation and obligation will benefit our stockholders
 in balancing these interests our board of directors may take actions that do not maximize stockholder value. Any benefits to stockholders resulting from our public benefit purposes may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all and may have negative effects. For example: 









 including farmers
 suppliers
 crew members and local communities
 even though the changes may be costly; 









 such as building state-of-the-art facilities with technology and quality control mechanisms that exceed the requirements of USDA and the FDA
 even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives; 


















 our board of directors may be influenced by the interests of our stakeholders
 including farmers
 suppliers
 crew members and local communities
 whose interests may be different from the interests of our stockholders. 


We may be unable or slow to realize the benefits we expect from actions taken to benefit our stakeholders
 including farmers
 suppliers
 crew members and local communities
 which could adversely affect our business
 operations
 which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. 

 we may be subject to increased derivative litigation concerning our duty to balance stockholder and public benefit interests
 the occurrence of which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

 our stockholders (if they
 individually or collectively
 own at least 2% of our outstanding capital stock or shares having at least $2&#160;million in market value (whichever is less)) are entitled to file a derivative lawsuit claiming that our directors failed to balance stockholder and public benefit interests. This potential liability does not exist for traditional corporations. Therefore
 we may be subject to the possibility of increased derivative litigation
 which would require the attention of management and
 as a result
 may adversely impact management&#8217;s ability to effectively execute our strategy. Any such derivative litigation may be costly and have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 


 and if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
 the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. 

 or IPO
 we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures. In connection with the audit of our financial statements for fiscal 2018
 we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A &#8220;material weakness&#8221; is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

 there were certain post-close adjustments that were required that were material to the financial statements. These material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. In connection with the audit of our financial statements for 2019
 we determined that the previously identified material weaknesses had been remediated. 

 we hired additional accounting personnel and implemented process level and management review controls. We can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements
 cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. 

 we are required to further design
 document and test our internal controls over financial reporting to comply with Section&#160;404. We cannot be certain that additional material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future. If material weaknesses or control deficiencies occur in the future
 we may be unable to report our financial results accurately on a timely basis or help prevent fraud
 which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence or delisting and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. If we have material weaknesses in the future
 it could affect the financial results that we report or create a perception that those financial results do not fairly state our financial position or results of operations. Either of those events could have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock. 

 even if we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP
 because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Failure to implement required new or improved controls
 or difficulties encountered in their implementation
 could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations. 


We are an &#8220;emerging growth company

 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements
 and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Pursuant to Section&#160;107 of the JOBS Act
 as an emerging growth company
 we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As a result
 our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies
 which may make our common stock less attractive to investors. In addition
 if we cease to be an emerging growth company
 we will no longer be able to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.

 if we do not adopt a new or revised accounting standard
 our future results of operations may not be as comparable to the results of operations of certain other companies in our industry that adopted such standards. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active trading market for our common stock
 and our stock price may be more volatile. 

 and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices. 

 we will incur significant finance
 legal
 accounting and other expenses
 including director and officer liability insurance
 that we did not incur as a private company
 which we expect to further increase after we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company.&#8221; The Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 the listing requirements of Nasdaq
 and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover
 these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the specific timing of such costs. 

 or Section&#160;404
 we will be required to furnish a report by management on
 among other things
 the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending December&#160;30
 2021. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition
 our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our first annual report required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 or SEC
 following the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. To prepare for eventual compliance with Section&#160;404
 we will be engaged in a costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section&#160;404
 but we may not be able to complete our evaluation
 testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion once initiated. Our compliance with Section&#160;404 will require that we incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group
 and we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section&#160;404.

 2020
 no public market for our common stock existed. An active public trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or
 if further developed
 may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies by using our shares as consideration.

 approximately 52.2% of our outstanding capital stock. As a result
 these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval
 including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions
 such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit stockholders&#8217; ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us. 


 or the perception that these sales might occur
 could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our existing equityholders have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold

 rights and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock; 


















 the chairperson of our board of directors
 or our chief executive officer; 









 including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;

 which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition
 because we are incorporated in Delaware
 we are governed by the provisions of Section&#160;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
 which generally
 subject to certain exceptions
 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any &#8220;interested&#8221; stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an &#8220;interested&#8221; stockholder. 

 as a public benefit corporation
 our board of directors is required by the Delaware General Corporation Law to manage or direct our business and affairs in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of our stockholders
 the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct
 and the specific public benefits identified in our certificate of incorporation. Additionally
 pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
 a vote of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock is required for matters directly or indirectly amending or removing our public benefit purpose
 or to effect a merger or consolidation involving stock consideration with an entity that is not a public benefit corporation with an identical public benefit to ours. We believe that our public benefit corporation status will make it more difficult for another party to obtain control of us without maintaining our public benefit corporation status and purpose. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock
 and they could deter potential acquirers of our company
 thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your shares of our common stock in an acquisition. 


Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
 to the extent enforceable
ral district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders
 which could restrict our stockholders&#8217; ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors

 Section&#160;22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly
 both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts

 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.

 a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring such a claim arising under the Securities Act against us and our directors

 we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions
 and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions
 any of which could seriously harm our business.

 allowing us to bring high-quality products from our network of small family farms to a national audience. This framework has enabled us to become the leading U.S. brand of pasture-raised eggs and butter and the second largest U.S. egg brand by retail dollar sales. Our ethics are exemplified by our focus on the humane treatment of farm animals and sustainable farming practices. We believe these standards produce happy hens with varied diets
 which produce better eggs. There is a seismic shift in consumer demand for ethically produced
 natural
 traceable
 clean label
 great-tasting and nutritious foods. Supported by a steadfast adherence to the values on which we were founded
 we have designed our brand and products to appeal to this consumer movement. 
Our purpose is rooted in a commitment to Conscious Capitalism
 which prioritizes the long-term benefits of each of our stakeholders (farmers and suppliers
 customers and consumers
 communities and the environment
 crew members and stockholders). Our business decisions consider the impact on all of our stakeholders
 in contrast with the factory farming model
 which principally emphasizes cost reduction at the expense of animals
 farmers
 consumers
 crew members
 communities and the environment. These principles guide our day-to-day operations and
 we believe
 help us deliver a more sustainable and successful business. Our approach has been&#160;validated by our financial performance and our designation as a Certified B Corporation

 we have expanded our operations and our portfolio of pasture-raised food products as illustrated below:





 the farmer is responsible for all of the working capital and investments required to produce the eggs and manage the farm
 including purchasing the birds and feed supply. We are contractually obligated to purchase all of the eggs produced by the farmer during the term of the contract at an agreed upon price that depends upon pallet weight and is indexed quarterly in arrears for changes in feed cost. 


We believe we are a strategic and valuable partner to retailers. We have continued to command premium prices for our products

In November 2020
 we completed a secondary public offering of 5

 from which no proceeds were received and expenses incurred totaled $0.5 million. 


 2020
 we established a cross-functional task force and have implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our stakeholders
 comprised of farmers and suppliers
 customers and consumers
 communities and the environment
 crew members and stockholders. While we are not experiencing material adverse impacts at this time
 given the global economic slowdown
 the overall disruption of global supply chains and distribution systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic
 our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation as we evolve our business continuity plans and response strategy. In March 2020
 the majority of our crew members at our headquarters transitioned to working remotely
 and such remote work continues as of the date of this Annual Report.  While the rollout of vaccines has begun
 the timing of vaccinations
 herd immunity
 and the lifting of shelter in place and similar restrictions and movement restrictions is unknown
 and virus mutations and variants may continue to restrict our ability to return to full onsite operations.




 we are managing operations through &#8220;essential&#8221; on-site staff and flexible work arrangements
 and may need to further modify or reduce operations due to the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are working closely with our farmers
 manufacturers to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions to our product supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect to have an adequate supply of eggs to meet anticipated demand in fiscal 2021
 as well as adequate capacity for packing and processing our eggs.

 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
 there have been recent disruptions in the U.S. pasture-raised milk supply
 including significant drops in prices and demand
 which have resulted in the loss of suppliers. While we have worked with our co-manufacturers to mitigate these supply disruptions
 and as a result there has been no impact on our ability to fill customer orders for pasture-raised butter or ghee products
 we expect that these supply disruptions will continue for the foreseeable future and that they may be further exacerbated by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists for an extended period of time and further impacts egg or milk supply
 or disrupts our essential distribution systems
 we could experience disruptions to our supply chain and operations
 and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our products
 which would adversely impact our ability to generate sales of and revenues from our products. 


 2020 and access to additional funds as a result of our IPO and under our credit facility agreement with PNC Bank
 National Association
 or the Credit Facility
 we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to make investments in our business this fiscal year in support of our long-term growth strategy. Our IPO
 which was completed on August 4
 2020
 resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $99.7 million
 after deducting underwriting discounts
 commissions and offering costs associated with the offering. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents as of December&#160;27
 2020
 together with cash provided by our operating activities
 and availability of borrowings under our existing Credit Facility
 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses for at least the next 12 months and to make investments in our business in support of our long-term growth strategy. 

 including our pace of new and existing customer growth
 our investments in innovation
 our investments in partnerships and unexplored channels and the costs associated with our expansion of Egg Central Station. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. However
 the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens
 we could experience an inability to access additional capital
 which could in the future negatively affect our operations. In the event that we require additional financing
 we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation and product expansion
 we may not be able to compete successfully
 which would harm our business
 operations and results of operations. 

We believe recent increases in our net revenue have been driven in part by the impact of stay at home trends associated with COVID-19
 as a result of which consumers have increased their purchases of staples such as eggs and butter. The $6.7 billion retail egg category grew 18.7% in 2020 as compared to the prior year
 outpaced by the specialty egg segment growth of 25.5% versus the prior year and total Vital Farms pasture-raised eggs growth of 53.1% as compared to the prior year. We believe this growth is yet another indication that consumers are shifting their preferences to premium products
 even in a highly commoditized category. The total egg category benefited from the increased eat-at-home trends during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
 growing 40.6% in the second quarter as compared to the prior year period. Despite the pandemic persisting throughout the year
 the total egg category growth has decelerated to 10.0% in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period. The specialty egg segment grew 37.3% in the second quarter as compared to the prior year period
 compared to 21.5% in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period. Vital Farms pasture-raised eggs grew 74.3% in the second quarter as compared to the prior year period and 37.9% in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period. We believe this is indicative of a shift in consumer preferences resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  

 2020
 five million households purchased Vital Farms shell eggs
 a 50% increase over the prior year. New purchasers
 defined as households who purchased Vital Farms in 2020 and not in 2019
 increased 55% over the prior year. Retained households
 defined as households who purchased Vital Farms in 2020 and 2019
 increased 38% over the prior year. Throughout 2020
 Vital Farms retained more households each quarter
 with 588 thousand buyers repeating egg purchases in both the third and fourth quarters.


Additionally
eve that COVID-19 has accelerated the demand for e-commerce options in the retail channel. For example
 our online fresh grocery sales at a key retailer have increased 266% during the 52 weeks ended December 27
&#8220;click &amp; collect&#8221; sales at two national brick and mortar retailers have increased 542% and 174%
 respectively
 over the 52 weeks ended December 27
% year to date through the week ended December 27
 2020 compared to the same time period a year ago. This growth in e-commerce demand is compared to an increase of 52% for retail dollar sales overall for that same period for the 52 weeks ended December 27
 2020. We anticipate that our performance will be affected by the duration of COVID-19&#8217;s impact on stay at home trends
 and we do not have certainty that these trends will continue. Our net revenue may be more variable as a result

 grow within the retail channel and execute on our corporate development objectives will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time
 such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic
 travel restrictions
 quarantines
 social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States
 and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease. For example
 if remote work policies for certain portions of our business
 or for our business partners
 are extended longer than we currently expect
 we may need to reassess our priorities and our corporate objectives for the fiscal year. Additionally
 while the transition of the majority of our headquarters crew members to remote working in March 2020 has not materially disrupted our business operations
 our financial close or reporting processes or the functioning of our internal controls
 we are continuing to monitor these processes and may need to adjust them in the future as a result of the fluid nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations. 


 ending on the last Sunday in December
 effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In a 52-53-week fiscal year
&#160;each fiscal quarter consists of 13&#160;weeks. The additional week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the fourth quarter
 making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Our first 53-week fiscal year will be fiscal 2023
 which we expect to begin on December&#160;26
 2022 and end on December&#160;31
 2023. See &#8220;Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation&#8221; in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details related to our fiscal calendar. 


 they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address to enable us to sustain the growth of our business and improve our results of operations. 


 clean-label
 traceable
 ethical
 great-tasting and nutritious foods. We believe there is substantial opportunity to grow our consumer base and increase the velocity at which households purchase our products. U.S. household penetration for the shell egg category is approximately 98%
 while the household penetration for our pasture-raised shell eggs is approximately 3.9%. We intend to increase household penetration by continuing to invest significantly in sales and marketing to educate consumers about our brand
 our values and the premium quality of our products. We believe these efforts will educate consumers on the ethical value and the attractive attributes of pasture-raised food
 generate further demand for our products and ultimately expand our consumer base. Our ability to attract new consumers will depend
 among other things
 on the perceived value and quality of our products
 the offerings of our competitors and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Our performance depends significantly on factors that may affect the level and pattern of consumer spending in the U.S. natural food market in which we operate. Such factors include consumer preference
 consumer confidence
 consumer income
 consumer perception of the safety and quality of our products and shifts in the perceived value for our products relative to alternatives. 


 like Whole Foods and Sprouts
 we sell our products through distributors. We are not able to precisely attribute our net revenue to a specific retailer for products sold through such channels. We rely on third-party data to calculate the portion of retail sales attributable to such retailers
 but this data is inherently imprecise because it is based on gross sales generated by our products sold at retailers
 without accounting for price concessions
 promotional activities or chargebacks
 and because it measures retail sales for only the portion of our retailers serviced through distributors. Based on this third-party data and internal analysis
 Whole Foods accounted for approximately 28% and 30% of our retail sales for the fiscal years ended December&#160;27
 2020 and December 29
 2019
 respectively
 and Sprouts accounted for approximately 7% and 8% of our retail sales for the fiscal years ended December&#160;27
 2020 and December 29
 2019
 respectively.


 2020
 are more than 16
000 stores selling our products. We expect the retail channel to be our largest source of net revenue for the foreseeable future. By capturing greater shelf space
 driving higher product velocities and increasing our SKU count
 there is meaningful runway for further growth with existing retail customers. Additionally
significant further long-term opportunity in additional distribution channels
 including the convenience
 drugstore
 club
consumers
 and we also believe this growth will allow for margin expansion. To accomplish these objectives
 we intend to continue leveraging consumer awareness of and demand for our brand
ustomer-specific marketing tactics. Our ability to grow within the retail channel will depend on a number of factors
 such as our customers&#8217; satisfaction with the sales
 product velocities and profitability of our products. 

We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand sales of our products in the foodservice channel in the medium- to long-term. In fiscal year ended December&#160;27
 2020
 the foodservice channel accounted for approximately 1% of our net revenue. Our brand has a differentiated value proposition with consumers
 are increasingly demanding ethically produced ingredients when they eat outside of the home. Additionally
 in January 2021
 we began a partnership with Acosta Foodservice
 U.S. foodservice sales and marketing agency in the consumer-packaged goods industry to increase our broadline distribution and presence in national and regional restaurant chains. We believe that more consumers will look for our products on menus
 particularly with foodservice partners whose values are aligned with our own
 and that on-menu branding of our products as ingredients in popular meals and menu items will drive traffic and purchases in the foodservice channel. We also believe that branded foodservice offerings will further help drive consumer awareness of our brand and purchase rates of our products in the retail channel. One example of our successful foodservice programs is with Tacodeli LLC
 a popular chain based in Austin
 Texas
 which sells breakfast tacos made exclusively with our pasture-raised shell eggs across 11 restaurant locations and approximately 90 points of distribution
 such as coffee shops and farmers market stands
 across Texas. We have launched similar regional concepts with Moe&#8217;s Broadway Bagel
 an East Coast-style family-run bagel chain in the Denver/Boulder
 Colorado area; Cafe Patachou
 a breakfast and lunch restaurant based in the Indianapolis
 Indiana area with 5 locations; Roam Artisan Burgers
 a fast-casual burger restaurant dedicated to high-quality sourcing in the San Francisco
 California area with 6 locations; Homegrown
 a sustainability-focused brand in the Seattle
 Washington area with 11 locations; and Pura Vida
 a fresh all-day concept in the Miami
 Florida area with 7 locations. We also believe there is significant additional opportunity in micro-markets
 corporate offices
 the hospitality industry
 and colleges and universities in the medium- to long-term. We intend to continue to invest in relationships with foodservice operators
 including to support joint marketing and advertising of our products. Expansion in this channel will depend on the health of the foodservice industry generally and on our ability to successfully partner with foodservice operators in a manner that leverages and reinforces our value proposition with consumers.


 pasture-raised ghee and liquid whole eggs in 2019 and egg bites in August 2020. We believe there is opportunity to expand in the future into the refrigerated value-added dairy category
 among others. Eggs generated $196.7 million
 or approximately 92%
 of net revenue in fiscal 2020. We expect eggs will be our largest source of net revenue for the foreseeable future. We believe that investments in innovation will contribute to our long-term growth
 including by reinforcing our efforts to increase household penetration. Our ability to successfully develop
 market and sell new products will depend on a variety of factors
 including the availability of capital to invest in innovation
 as well as changing consumer preferences and demand for food products.

 we recognize a liability for an estimated promotional allowance reserve. We periodically provide credits or discounts to our customers in the event that products do not conform to customer expectations upon delivery or expire at a customer&#8217;s site.  We treat these credits and discounts
 when accepted by customers
 as a reduction of the sales price of the related transaction. We anticipate that these promotional activities
 credits and discounts could impact our net revenue and that changes in such activities could impact period-over-period results. 


l eggs are sold to consumers at a premium price point
 and when prices for commodity shell eggs fall relative to the price of our pasture-raised shell eggs

 or 52%
 was primarily driven by an increase in egg gross sales of $77.9 million and an increase in gross butter sales of $4.9 million. The increases were partially offset by an increase of $7.6 million of sales incentives offered to our customers as our volume has grown. The $7.6 million of sales incentives includes a reduction of $0.6 million of incentive settled in 2020 that related to a prior year&#8217;s gross sales. The increases in egg sales and butter sales were primarily due to volume increases to our distributors
 including as a result of continued trends associated with COVID-19 whereby consumers increased their purchases of staples of eggs and butter
 a higher turnover rate of sales to our retail customers
 and new distribution at new and existing customers. We do not have certainty that any COVID-19 trends will continue. Net revenue from sales through our retail channel was $208.5 million and $136.5 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019
 respectively
 net revenue of sales through our foodservice channel was $3.1 million and $3.4 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019
 and net revenue from sales to wholesalers and egg breaking plants was $2.6 million and $0.8 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019.

 when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP
 provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business

 we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a measure used by management in assessing the health of our business

 as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. 

 has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include that (1)&#160;it does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future
 (2)&#160;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges
 the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures
 (3)&#160;it does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense
 (4)&#160;it does not reflect other non-operating expenses
 including interest expense
 (5)&#160;it does not consider the impact of any contingent consideration liability valuation adjustments and (6)&#160;it does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. In addition
 our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner
 limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations
 when evaluating our performance
 you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial measures

We purchase our egg inventories under long-term supply contracts with farms. Purchase commitments contained in these arrangements are variable dependent upon the quantity of eggs produced by the farms. As a result
 these commitments have been excluded from the contractual obligations disclosed above. In addition
 substantially all of the long-term supply contracts with farms contain components that meet the definition of embedded leases under ASC Topic 840
. As total purchase commitments contained under these arrangements are variable
 the amount attributable to the lease component are contingent rentals
 and there are no minimum lease payments associated with these long-term supply contracts. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere for additional details related to our long-term supply contracts with farms.

Since inception
 we have funded our operations with proceeds from sales of our capital stock
 proceeds from borrowings and cash flows from the sale of our products. We had net income of $8.8 million for the year ended December&#160;27
 2020
 and retained earnings of $14.0 million as of December&#160;27
 2020. We completed our IPO on August 4
 2020 resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $99.7 million
 after deducting underwriting discounts
 commissions and offering costs associated with the offering. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents
 together with cash provided by our operating activities
 and available borrowings under our existing Credit Facility
 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors
 including our pace of new and existing customer growth
 our investments in innovation
n of Egg Central Station. As of December 27
 2020
 we expect to spend $25 million on our expansion of Egg Central Station. If we are required to seek additional equity or debt financing
 we may not be able to raise such funding on terms acceptable to us or at all. Further
 the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens
 we could experience an inability to access additional capital
 which could in the future negatively affect our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation and product expansion
 we may not be able to compete successfully
 which would harm our business
 operations and financial condition. 




 National Association
 or PNC Bank in October 2017.  The Credit Facility initially included a $7.9&#160;million term loan
 a $15.0&#160;million revolving line of credit and an equipment loan with a maximum borrowing capacity of $3.0 million and matures in October 2022.

 we entered into amended loan agreements with PNC Bank
 which we refer to as the First Amendment Loan and the Second Amendment Loan
 respectively. The First Amendment Loan amended the Credit Facility to decrease the maximum borrowings under the equipment loan from $1.5 million to $750
000
 and to waive existing events of default. The Second Amendment Loan amended the Credit Facility to modify various definitions and terms that were not significant. 

 we entered into the Third Amendment to our Credit Facility
 which we refer to as the Third Amendment Loan. The Third Amendment Loan amended the Credit Facility to waive existing events of default.

 we entered into the Sixth Amendment to our Credit Facility
 which we refer to as the Sixth Amendment Loan. The Sixth Amendment Loan amended certain terms and conditions under our Credit Facility and increased the maximum borrowing capacity of the Credit Facility to $25.9 million. In addition
 the Sixth Amendment Loan refinanced our term loan and provided for the borrowing of an additional $5.0 million
 resulting in the issuance of an amended and restated secured term loan note in the amount of $7.9 million. 

 followed by a balloon payment of all unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest due July 2027. Interest on borrowings under the amended and restated term loan accrues at a rate
 at our election at the time of borrowing
 equal to (i) LIBOR plus 3.25% or (ii) 2.25% plus the sum of the Federal Funds Open Rate plus 50 basis points and the Daily LIBOR Rate plus 100 basis points.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&#160;27
 2020
 there was $0 outstanding under the amended and restated term loan which was fully paid off in December 2020.

 as well as loan advances thereunder
 accrues at a rate
 at our election at the time of borrowing
 equal to (i)&#160;LIBOR plus 2.25% or (ii)&#160;1.25% plus the alternate base rate. In April 2020
 all outstanding amounts under the Revolving Line of Credit were repaid and the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving line of credit was 4.5%.

 subject to certain restrictions. Any borrowings under the equipment loan from October&#160;2018 through October&#160;2021 will be due and payable beginning the following month with 36 monthly installments of principal due through October&#160;2022
 and all accrued and unpaid interest due October&#160;2022. Interest on borrowings under the equipment loan accrues at a rate

 net cash provided by operating activities was $11.7 million and was primarily driven by net income of $8.8 million
 total non-cash items of $6.7 million
 and a decrease in net working capital items of $3.9 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $2.6 million
 non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million and deferred income taxes of $1.8 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in net working capital items was primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in accounts payable
 a $0.2 million decrease in income taxes receivable
 partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in prepaids and other current assets
 a $4.7 million increase in accounts receivable

 offset by lower accruals related to the timing of vendor invoices.
In fiscal 2019
 net cash used in operating activities was $5.4&#160;million resulting primarily from net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $12.2&#160;million
 partially offset by noncash charges of $3.5&#160;million and net income of $3.3&#160;million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities for fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of increases in inventories

 income taxes receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $9.2&#160;million
 $6.2&#160;million
 $1.5&#160;million and $0.6&#160;million
 respectively
 partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $3.2&#160;million and increases in accrued and other liabilities of $2.1&#160;million. The increases in accounts receivable were primarily due to new customers and distribution centers
 in addition to increased orders from our existing customers
 while the increases in inventories were primarily due to a significant increase in egg inventory and packaging inventory to support anticipated demand. The increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets were primarily due to transaction costs associated with our IPO. The increases in accounts payable were primarily due to increase in amounts due to our partner farms for lost income as a result of removing birds from current flocks ahead of schedule and additional increases in shipping and packaging costs. The increases in accrued liabilities were primarily due to timing of vendor invoices.
In fiscal 2018
 net cash provided by operating activities was $11.4&#160;million resulting primarily from net income of $5.6&#160;million

 partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $3.6&#160;million
 an increase in inventory of $1.0&#160;million
 and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.5&#160;million. The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily due to increases in a payment associated with an over recovery of promotions related to a customer and overall increase to inventory purchases and payroll related costs associated with our continued growth. The increases in accounts receivable were primarily due to new customers and distribution centers
 in addition to increased orders from our existing customers. The increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets were primarily due to our gain contingency in connection with our lawsuit settlement in which we were the plaintiff.


 net cash used in investing activities was $77.8 million resulting primarily from $68.4 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities

 cash flows and financial position are unclear. However
 we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable
 due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates
 actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. Such estimates principally include revenue recognition
 determination of useful lives for property and equipment
 goodwill
 contingent consideration
 allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventory obsolescence
 valuation of common stock
 stock option valuations
 redeemable noncontrolling interest
 accrual liabilities and income taxes.

 the JOBS Act was enacted. Section&#160;107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&#160;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore
 an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act. Accordingly
 our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

 2020 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales for the year ended December&#160;27
 2020 of approximately&#160;$1.6 million. We seek to&#160;mitigate the impact of raw materials cost increases by negotiating pricing agreements. We strive to offset the impact of raw materials cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers. 




 and under our buy-sell contracts
 which account for 98% of the laying hens in our network of family farms as of December&#160;27
 2020
 the price we pay is also indexed quarterly in arrears for changes in feed cost
 which may cause our agreed-upon pricing under these contracts to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Under the remainder of our contracts
 we are directly responsible for purchasing feed. Either type of contract subjects us to risk of price fluctuations in feed ingredients
 primarily consisting of corn and soy. We do not attempt to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of these ingredients by using future
 forward
 option or other derivative instruments. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the weighted-average cost of these ingredients as of December&#160;27
 2020 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales for the year ended December&#160;27
 2020 of approximately&#160;$3.4 million. We strive to offset the impact of ingredient cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers.

Based on the average interest rate on the instruments under the Credit Facility during the fiscal year ended December&#160;27

 and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding
 we do not believe that a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal year ended December&#160;27

 and therefore our net revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. We purchase certain equipment from foreign countries
 and the cost related to this equipment is denominated in the currency of the applicable country. Additionally
 to the extent our sourcing strategy changes or we commence generating revenue outside of the United States that is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar
 our results of operations could be impacted by changes in exchange rates. To date
 we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments
 although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would not have had a material effect on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 27

 except share and per share amounts) 


 Inc. (&#8220;Vital Farms&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware on June&#160;6
 2013 and is headquartered in Austin
 Texas. Vital Farms packages
 markets and distributes pasture-raised shell eggs
 pasture-raised butter and other products. These products are sold under the trade names Vital Farms
 Alfresco Farms
 Lucky Ladies and RedHill Farms
 primarily to retail foodservice channels in the United States. 

 LLC
 Backyard Eggs
 LLC
 Barn Door Farms
 LLC and Sagebrush Foodservice
 LLC are all wholly owned subsidiaries of Vital Farms. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the audited consolidated financial statements. 
The Company&#8217;s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December and contains either 52 or 53 weeks. Therefore
 the financial results of certain 53-week years will not be exactly comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week years. The years ended December&#160;27
 2020
 December 29
 2019
 and December 30
 2018 all contain operating results for 52 weeks.
 Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
 the Company has implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company&#8217;s business. The Company does not currently anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material impact on the timelines for the Company&#8217;s product development and expansion efforts. However
 the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company&#8217;s business
 product development and expansion efforts
 corporate development objectives and the value of and market for the Company&#8217;s common stock will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time
 such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic
 travel restrictions
 quarantines
 social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States
 and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease
 including the roll-out of vaccines. The global economic slowdown
 the overall disruption of global supply chains and distribution systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business
 financial condition
 results of operations and growth prospects. 

 In July 2020
 the board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved a 2.46-for-1 forward stock split of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock and preferred stock
 which was effected on July 22
 2020. Stockholders entitled to fractional shares as a result of the forward stock split received a cash payment in lieu of receiving fractional shares. All common stock
 preferred stock
 and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this forward stock split for all periods presented. Shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock options and other equity instruments were proportionately increased and the respective per share value and exercise prices
 if applicable
 were proportionately decreased in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing such securities. There were no changes in the par values of the Company&#8217;s common stock and preferred stock as a result of the forward stock split.

876 shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. Subsequent to the closing of the IPO
 there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. The consolidated financial statements as of December&#160;27
 2020
 including share and per share amounts
 include the effects of the IPO.
In November 2020
 the Company completed a secondary public offering of 5
000
000 shares of common stock from selling stockholders in which no proceeds from the sale of shares were received by the Company and the Company incurred $0.5 million of expenses.




The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates principally include revenue recognition
 determination of useful lives for property and equipment
 trade spend accruals
 goodwill
 allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventory obsolescence
 valuation of common stock prior to IPO
 stock option valuations
 accrual liabilities and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


 future COVID-19 developments are highly uncertain and unpredictable at this time; therefore
As of&#160;the date of issuance of these consolidated financial&#160;statements
 the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that would require the Company to update its estimates
 assumptions and judgments or revise the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained and are recognized in the consolidated financial&#160;statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial&#160;statements.

The Company considers all short-term
 highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash deposits are all in financial institutions in the United States. As of December&#160;27
 2020
 cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with balances denominated in U.S. dollars and investments in money market funds.


The Company accounts for its investment securities in accordance with ASC Topic 320
.&#160;The Company considers all of its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value
 and there are no restrictions on the Company's ability to sell within the next 12 months as available-for-sale. We have classified these securities as current
 because the amounts invested are available for current operations. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value
 with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.



The Company consolidates all entities where a controlling financial interest exists. The Company has considered its relationships with a certain entity to determine whether the Company has a variable interest in that entity
 and if so

The Company operates and manages its business as one reportable and operating segment. The Company&#8217;s chief executive officer

 including pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.




 accounts payable
 accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
Accounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for bad debts charged to earnings. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the receivable is no longer collectible. These losses have been immaterial to date. Subsequent recoveries
 if any
 are credited to the allowance. The allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based on the credit risk of specific customers
 past collection history
 and management&#8217;s evaluation of accounts receivable. The evaluation is inherently subjective
 as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. As of December 27
 2020 and December 29
 2019 the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $196 and $304 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined under the first-in
 first-out method) or net realizable value. Inventory includes eggs
 butter
 packaging
 feed
 laying hens
 pullets
 merchandise and equipment parts. A reduction in the carrying value of an inventory item from cost to net realizable value is recorded in cost of goods sold with the offset to inventory. Any inventory that does not meet the quality control standards of the Company is separated and a reserve is recorded for the cost.

 Plant and Equipment

 plant and equipment are stated at cost
 net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The general range of useful lives of other property
 plant and equipment is as follows:







































































When assets are sold or retired
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts
 with any resulting gain or loss recorded in income from operations in the consolidated statement



 a quantitative goodwill assessment is required. In the quantitative evaluation
 the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value
 then the carrying value is deemed to be recoverable and no further action is required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value
 goodwill is considered impaired for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value and a charge is reported as impairment of goodwill in the consolidated statements of operations. To date
 the Company has not recorded any impairment charges associated with its goodwill.
The Company reviews the carrying value of property
 plant and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value
 an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results
 trends and prospects and the effects of obsolescence
 demand
 competition and other economic factors. The Company did not recognize an impairment loss during the years ended December 27
 2020
 December 29
 2019
 and December&#160;30
 2018.
&#160;In connection with the Company&#8217;s acquisition of certain assets of Heartland Eggs
 LLC in 2014
&#160;the Company was required to&#160;make royalty payments to prior owners of certain assets of Heartland Eggs. The royalty payments are contingent on the Company&#8217;s future purchase of eggs from supplier contracts that were acquired in the certain assets of Heartland Eggs acquisition. The royalty payments are deemed to be contingent because the future egg purchases are not guaranteed
 and the timing and amount of any such purchases are unknown. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). These inputs included projected financial information
 market volatility
 risk-adjusted discount rates and timing of contractual payments. Subsequent to the acquisition date
 at each reporting date
 the contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recorded within selling
 general and administrative expenses in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations.
The Company recognizes noncontrolling interest related to VIEs
 in which the Company is the primary beneficiary
 as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent entity&#8217;s equity. The amount of net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is included in consolidated net income on the face of the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the parent entity&#8217;s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are treated as equity transactions if the parent entity retains its controlling financial interest. In addition
 when a subsidiary is deconsolidated
 any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value and the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the retained interest will be recorded as a gain or loss. Affiliate equity interests where the Company has certain rights to demand settlement are presented at their current redemption values
 as redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet. Because these transactions take place between entities under common control
 any gains or losses attributable to these transactions are required to be included within additional paid-in-capital on the consolidated balance sheets.
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In estimating future tax consequences
 the Company considers all expected future events other than enactment of changes in tax laws or rates. A valuation allowance is recorded
 if necessary
 to reduce net deferred tax assets to their realizable values if management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized.
The Company follows the provisions of the authoritative guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. These provisions provide a comprehensive model for the recognition
 measurement and disclosure in financial statements of uncertain income tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Under these provisions
 a company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination
 based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise
 no benefit can be recognized. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the sustainability of the position and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date
 unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed. Additionally
 the Company must accrue interest and related penalties
 if applicable
 on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws.

(Loss) per Share Attributable to Vital Farms

 there is no allocation required under the two-class method since the Preferred Stock does not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company&#8217;s losses.

 diluted net loss per common share attributable to the Company&#8217;s common stockholders is the same as basic net loss
 because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
The Company generates revenue primarily through sales of products
 including pasture-raised eggs and butter
 to its customers
 which include natural channel retailers
 mainstream channel retailers and foodservice partners. The Company sells its products to customers on a purchase-order basis. 
Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and the related performance obligation is satisfied
 which typically occurs upon delivery of the product to the customer
We offer sales incentives through various programs to customers and allow deductions from our customers
 which may include credits or discounts to customers in the event that products do not conform to customer specifications or expire at a customer&#8217;s site. The cost associated with promotions and chargebacks is estimated and recorded as a reduction in revenue and is recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded
 which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of this cost therefore requires management judgement regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed. Differences between estimated cost and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.

The Company measures all stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards
 over the requisite service period
 which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
 which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions
 including the fair market value of the Company&#8217;s common stock
 expected stock price volatility
 the expected term of the option
 the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option
 and the Company&#8217;s expected dividend yield.
Effective December&#160;31

 the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-07
(&#8220;ASU 2018-07&#8221;)
 which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment awards to nonemployees. As a result
 stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees are accounted for in the same manner as awards granted to employees and directors as described above. The impact of adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

 The Company is an&#160;&#8220;emerging growth company&#8221;&#160;as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (&#8220;JOBS Act). Under the JOBS Act
 emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised financial accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company elected to use the extended transition period for complying with the adoption of new or revised accounting standards
 and
 as a result of this election
 the Company&#8217;s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 
 In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-13
(&#8220;ASU 2018-13&#8221;)
 which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The standard is effective for all entities for years and interim periods within those years
 beginning after December&#160;15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 on December&#160;30
 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

 the FASB issued ASU 2020-04


 which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts
 hedging relationships
 and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The amendments are effective for all entities as of March&#160;12
 2020 through December&#160;31
 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2020-04 on March&#160;12
 2020 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU&#160;2016-02

 ASU 2019-10
 ASU 2020-02
 and ASU 2020-05 (collectively
 &#8220;Topic 842&#8221;). The guidance in Topic 842 supersedes the leasing guidance in Topic&#160;840
. Under the new guidance
 lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statement of operations. An entity may adopt the guidance either (1)&#160;retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative-effect adjustment recognized at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or (2)&#160;retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption through a cumulative-effect adjustment. The Company expects to adopt Topic 842 retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption
 December&#160;27
 2021
 through a cumulative-effect adjustment
 and will not apply the new standard to comparative periods presented. The new standard provides a number of practical expedients. Upon adoption
 the Company expects to elect all of the practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of Topic 842 on its consolidated financial statements. It is anticipated that the primary impact of the adoption of Topic 842 will be the recording of a right-of-use asset and lease liability of similar amount on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet.

 to introduce a new impairment model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. Topic 326 requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events
 including historical experience
 current conditions
 and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances.&#160;For non-public companies
 Topic 326 is effective for years beginning after December&#160;15
 2022
 including interim periods within those years. The Company expects to adopt Topic 326 on December&#160;26

A valuation allowance is required to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings
 the timing and amount of which are uncertain. A full review of all positive and negative evidence needs to be considered
 including the Company&#8217;s current and past performance
 the market environments in which the&#160;Company operates
 the utilization of past tax credits
 the length of carry back and carry forward periods and tax planning strategies that might be implemented. Management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended December&#160;27

000 rentable pallet spaces. The monthly lease payments include base rent charges of $55. In October 2020
 the lease was amended to terminate the agreement effective on December 31
 2020.

 Missouri for 3
750 rentable pallet spaces. The Company has the option to exceed the 3

 The Company purchases its egg inventories under long-term supply contracts with farms. Purchase commitments contained in these arrangements are variable dependent upon the quantity of eggs produced by the farms. Accordingly
 there are no estimable future purchase commitments associated with these supplier contracts. In addition
 substantially all the Company&#8217;s long-term supply contracts with farms contain components that meet the definition of embedded leases within the scope of Topic 840
. These arrangements convey to the Company the right to control implicitly identified property
 plant and equipment as it takes substantially all the utility generated by these assets over the term of the arrangements at a variable price. As total purchase commitments contained in these arrangements are variable
 the amounts attributable to the lease components are contingent rentals; there are no minimum lease payments associated with these long-term supply contracts. As the classification and timing of recognition of costs attributable to the eggs and embedded cost of the lease rentals are identical
 the Company does not allocate the total purchase cost of eggs between the cost of the eggs and the embedded cost of the lease rentals or distinguish between them in its accounting records. The Company records the total purchase costs of eggs
 which includes costs associated with the eggs and the corresponding costs of embedded lease rentals from the same arrangement
 into inventory. These costs are expensed to cost of goods sold when the associated eggs are sold to customers. During the years ended December&#160;27
 2020
 December 29
 2019
 and December 30
 2018
 the Company recognized total costs associated with its long-term supply contracts with farms of $84
537
 $54
380
 and $41
728
 respectively.
In the ordinary course of business
 the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors
 lessors
 business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including
 but not limited to
 losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition
 the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors and its executive officers that will require the Company
 among other things
 to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is
 in many cases
 unlimited. As of December&#160;27
 2020
 the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. 
The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies which are in the scope of ordinary and routine litigation incidental to its business
 including those related to regulation
 litigation
 business transactions
 employee-related matters and taxes
 among others. When the Company becomes aware of a claim or potential claim
 the likelihood of any loss or exposure is assessed. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated
 the Company records a liability for the loss. The liability recorded includes probable and estimable legal costs incurred to date and future legal costs to the point in the legal matter where the Company believes a conclusion to the matter will be reached. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated
 the Company discloses the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible. 

 Ovabrite Inc. (&#8220;Ovabrite&#8221;) settled claims made pursuant to a lawsuit in which Ovabrite was the defendant and a countersuit in which Ovabrite was the plaintiff and recorded a related gain of $1
200
 which is included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations. 

 The Company&#8217;s executive chairman and former Chief Executive Officer (the &#8220;Guarantor&#8221;) guaranteed the Company&#8217;s obligations under a line of credit agreement that was entered into in 2015 and that matured and was repaid in full in 2017. The Company issued a warrant to purchase 196
800 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an exercise price of $1.43 to the Guarantor in exchange for his guaranty. See Note 12
 &#8220;Common Stock and Common Stock Warrant.&#8221; The warrant expired on the earlier of June&#160;12
 2020 or the completion of the IPO. In June 2020
 the Guarantor exercised the warrant to purchase 196
800 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately $282. 
 Ovabrite is a related party because its founders are stockholders of the Company
 with the majority stockholder in Ovabrite also serving as the Company&#8217;s executive chairman and member of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. Since Ovabrite&#8217;s incorporation in November 2016
 the Company is deemed to have had a variable interest in Ovabrite
 and Ovabrite is deemed to have been a VIE
 of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly
 the Company has consolidated the results of Ovabrite since November 2016. All significant intercompany transactions between the Company and Ovabrite have been eliminated in consolidation. The Ovabrite entity is immaterial as of the year ended December 27
 2020.



In February 2019
 the Company issued promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $4
ts founder and a former member of the board of directors that is currently a board observer
 both of whom are also stockholders of the Company. The promissory notes bear monthly interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% and mature on the earlier of August&#160;7
 date of closing of a liquidity transaction which is defined as a merger
ued and unpaid interest are due on the Promissory Note Maturity Date. The borrower may prepay all or any portion of the promissory note at any time without premium or penalty. In November 2019
 $3
200 of the promissory notes were repaid.

 During the years ended December&#160;27
 2020
 December 29
 2019
 the Company recorded interest income of $97and $146
 respectively
 in connection with the promissory notes. 
 In March 2019 and April 2019
 the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 2
815
012 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $5.3286 per share
 for an aggregate purchase price of $15
000
 to entities associated with Manna Tree Partners. The co-founder and chief operating officer of Manna Tree Partners is a member of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. 


 Inc. (&#8220;Sandpebble&#8221;) for project management and related services associated with the construction and expansion of Egg Central Station. The owner and principal of Sandpebble is the father of an executive of the Company. In connection with the services described above

. In the event of our liquidation

 either for our own account or for the account of other security holders
 the holders of these shares will be entitled to certain piggyback registration rights allowing such holders to include their shares in such registration
 subject to certain marketing and other limitations. As a result
 whenever we propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act
 subject to certain exceptions
 the holders of these shares are entitled to notice of the registration and have the right to include their shares in the registration
 subject to limitations that the underwriters may impose on the number of shares included in the offering. 

shares of common stock are entitled to certain Form&#160;S-3 registration rights. If we are eligible to file a registration statement on Form&#160;S-3
&#160;these holders have the right
 upon written request from holders of at least 10% of such shares as are then outstanding
 to have such shares registered by us if the anticipated aggregate offering price of such shares

 voting together as a single class. 

 these provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management. In addition
 the authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change our control. 

 such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and may have the effect of delaying changes in our control or management. As a consequence
 these provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. We believe that the benefits of these provisions
 including increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure our company
 outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging takeover proposals
 because negotiation of takeover proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. 


 we may not

 amend our certificate of incorporation to delete or amend a provision relating to our public benefit corporation status or our public benefit purpose (or effect a merger or consolidation involving stock consideration with an entity that is not a public benefit corporation with an identical public benefit to ours). 

 as a public benefit corporation
 our board of directors is required by the Delaware General Corporation Law to manage or direct our business and affairs in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of our stockholders
 the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct
 and the specific public benefits identified in our certificate of incorporation. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law
 our stockholders may bring a derivative suit to enforce this requirement only if they own (individually or collectively)

 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.
