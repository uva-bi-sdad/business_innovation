Lifeway Foods
 Inc. (the Company or Lifeway) was co-founded in 1986 by Michael and Ludmila Smolyansky shortly after their emigration from Russia to the United States. Mr. and Mrs. Smolyansky were the first to successfully introduce Kefir to the U.S. consumer on a commercial scale
 initially catering to ethnic consumers in the Chicago metropolitan area. In the thirty years that have followed
 Lifeway has grown to become the largest producer and marketer of Kefir in the U.S. and an important player in the broader market spaces of probiotic-based products and natural
Lifeway's primary product is drinkable kefir
 a fermented dairy product. Kefir has a tart and tangy taste similar to yogurt and the consistency of a smoothie. Kefir also has a slightly effervescent quality all its own. Unlike yogurt though
 Lifeway incorporates a unique blend of probiotic kefir cultures in the fermentation process. The probiotic feature
 in concert with the base-line nutritional value of a staple beverage that is high in protein
 calcium and vitamin D
 and low in calories
Because of its drinkable feature
 kefir requires no spoon and is ideal for on-the-go consumption &#8230; straight from the bottle. Lifeway's Kefir is commonly consumed as part of a healthy breakfast or as an any-time, better for you snack in its native form or as a smoothie input. Kefir also serves as a base for lower-calorie dressings
 dips
 marinades
 soups or sauces and as a basic ingredient in other healthy
In addition to the drinkable kefir that we broadly market to consumers of all ages
 we also market and sell our ProBugs line of drinkable kefir which is delivered in our proprietary non-spill pouches (and in 3.5 oz. bottles) intended for children with caring
 health-conscious parents. Our frozen kefir offers a nutritional profile similar to our drinkable kefir but in a frozen bar and pint size container conventionally thought of as an indulgent treat. In addition to kefir

The company is committed to maintaining its position as the leading producer of Kefir and routinely evaluates opportunities for new product flavors and formulations
 improved package design
 new product configurations and other forms of routine innovation. As of December 31
 2015 the company offered over 50 unique varieties of its Kefir product including more than 20 unique flavors delivered to consumers on three different milk platforms (fat- free
 1% and whole milk) as well as in both organic and conventional ingredient profiles. During 2015 our routine innovations led to the introduction of several new items
Beyond routine innovation
 the company has an on-going effort to extend the strength of the Lifeway brand and leverage the capabilities of the Lifeway organization into categories outside of the dairy aisle including into non-food categories. Though we have not yet delivered a product to the market place that has clear commercial viability
The company's innovation
 research and development efforts are largely accomplished leveraging an intuitive entrepreneurial
 unstructured approach; not a highly formalized
The Company employs many skilled production managers across its three Kefir producing facilities who closely monitor our kefir-production process. The production managers have a complement of deep capabilities that spans from traditional dairy operations to the artisan
 old-world practices first introduced by Michael and Ludmila Smolyansky at the inception of the Company. We conduct routine tests
The Company includes a clearly legible freshness code on every Kefir product in order to ensure that our customers enjoy only the freshest products. To maintain the best of product freshness in the channel
 we expect our channel customers (a) to ensure that our products are delivered directly to the retailer's dairy cooler and (b) to rotate such product in a routine and timely way. Due to the perishable nature of our products and the costs associated with moving product back through the channel
 the Company does not offer return privileges to any of its channel customers; however
Retail-direct; and
Under the direct store delivery (DSD) route to market
Under the retail-direct channel
 our products are sold to the retailer and shipped to that retailer's distribution center. In turn our retail customer then delivers the product to their respective stores within their chain. Customers in this route-to-market grouping include among others Kroger
 Wal Mart and Costco. Under the retail direct model
 optimal product merchandising
Under the distributor channel
 our products are sold to distributors and shipped to that distributors designated warehouse. In turn
 our distributor customers then sell the product to their retail customers and ship the products to their retail customers. Our distributors often use a DSD model of their own to make deliveries directly to individual stores but also make deliveries to the retailer's warehouse. Our distributor customers include among others United Natural Foods
 Kehe Foods and C&amp;S Wholesale. Optimal product merchandising
Substantially all of Lifeway's products are distributed within the United States; however
 certain of our distributors sell our products to retailers in Mexico
 Costa Rica
 Dubai
 Hong Kong
 China
 and the Caribbean. Additionally
 the company's products reach a small number of consumers across Canada and in London
Beyond the customer's purchase order
Distributors are provided Lifeway products at wholesale prices for distribution to their retail accounts. Lifeway believes that the price at which its products are sold to its distributors is competitive with the prices generally paid by distributors for similar products in the markets served. Each distributor carries a line of Lifeway's products on its trucks
 checks the retail stores for space allocated to Lifeway's products
 determines inventory requirements of the store and places Lifeway products directly into the retailers' dairy cases. Lifeway believes this method of distribution best serves the needs of each retail store
 and is the best available means to ensure consistency and quality of product handling
 quality control
The Company engages in an on-going and wide variety marketing and media campaigns - primarily digital and social media
 print advertising in some newspapers and magazines and to a lesser extent television advertising. These marketing and media efforts are complemented by participation in sponsorships of cultural and community events
 various festivals
Our marketing efforts are aimed at stimulating demand with our existing consumers and at driving trial with new consumers by elevating Kefir awareness. Our Kefir awareness marketing seeks to promote the verifiable nutritional profile
 purity and good taste of our Kefir and to promote the common perception that our products may have a particular health benefit
Lifeway competes with a limited number of other domestic kefir producers and consequently faces a small amount of direct competition for kefir products; however
 Lifeway's kefir-based products compete with other dairy products
We purchase our ingredients such as raw milk
 cane and other forms of sugar and packaging materials from unaffiliated suppliers. Lifeway is not limited or contractually bound to any supplier beyond the terms of our purchase orders
During the year ended December 31
 2015 one distributor
 United Natural Foods
 Inc.
 represented approximately 19% of the Company's total sales and one retail customer
 Kroger
 represented approximately 7% of the Company's total sales. These customers collectively accounted for approximately 19% of accounts receivable as of December 31
The Company has determined that it has one reportable segment based on how the Company's chief operating decision maker manages the business and in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker
 who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing company performance
 has been identified collectively as the Chief Financial Officer
Since October
 1999 Groupe Danone SA has been the beneficial owner of approximately 20% of the outstanding common stock of Lifeway. Lifeway and Danone are parties to a Stockholders' Agreement dated October 1

In evaluating and understanding us and our business
 you should carefully consider the risks described below
 in conjunction with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II
 Item 7 and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contained in Part II
 Item 7A. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of
 or that we currently believe are not material
 may become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs
 our business
 financial condition
 results of operations
Our product categories face a high level of competition
We face significant competition in each of our product categories. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation
 product quality
 price
 brand recognition and loyalty
 effectiveness of marketing
 promotional activity
 and our ability to identify and satisfy consumer tastes and preferences. We believe that our brands have benefited in many cases from being the first to introduce products in their categories
 and their success has attracted competition from other food and beverage companies that produce branded products
 as well as from private label competitors. Some of our competitors
 such as Groupe Danone
 General Mills
 Inc.
 Dean Foods
 WhiteWave Foods
 Hain Celestial Group
 and Nestle S.A.
 have substantial financial and marketing resources. These competitors and others may be able to introduce innovative products more quickly or market their products more successfully than we can
We also compete with producers of non-organic products
 which have lower ingredient and production-related costs. As a result
 these non-organic producers may be able to offer conventional products to customers at a lower price point. This could cause us to lower our prices
 resulting in lower profitability or
 in the alternative
 cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices. Furthermore
 private label competitors are generally able to sell their products at lower prices because private label products typically have lower marketing costs than their branded counterparts. If our products fail to compete successfully with other branded or private label offerings
Additionally
 due to high levels of competition
 certain of our key retailers may demand price concessions on our products or may become more resistant to price increases for our products. Increased price competition and resistance to price increases have had
 and may continue to have
We believe that our future success depends
 in part
 on our ability to implement our growth strategy of leveraging our existing brands and products to drive increased sales. Our ability to implement this strategy depends
 among other things
We may not be able to implement this growth strategy successfully
If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences
dietary trends and increased attention to nutritional values
 such as the sugar
 fat
 protein
concerns regarding the health effects of specific ingredients and nutrients
 such as sugar
 other sweeteners
 dairy
 soybeans
 nuts
 oils
 vitamins
concerns regarding the public health consequences associated with obesity
If consumer demand for our products declines
We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims
 which could harm our reputation
The sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties
 misbranding
 product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects
 substances
 chemicals
 other agents
 or residues introduced during the growing
 storage
 processing
 handling or transportation phases. We also may be subject to liability if our products or production processes violate applicable laws or regulations
 including environmental
 health
 and safety requirements
 or in the event our products cause injury
 illness
In addition
 our product advertising could make us the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws
 including the consumer protection statutes of some states
A significant product liability
 consumer fraud
 or other legal judgment against us or a widespread product recall would negatively impact our profitability. Moreover
 claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. Even if a product liability
 consumer fraud
 or other claim is found to be without merit or is otherwise unsuccessful
 the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation and brand image
 particularly in categories that are promoted as having strong health and wellness credentials. Any loss of consumer confidence in our brand
Two of our customers together accounted for 26% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended December 31
 2015. We do not generally enter into written agreements with our customers
 and where such agreements exist
 they are generally terminable at will by the customer. In addition
 our customers sometimes award contracts based on competitive bidding
We may not be able to successfully complete strategic acquisitions
 establish joint ventures
identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture partners and accurately assess their value
 growth potential
 strengths
 weaknesses
 contingent and other liabilities
Acquired companies or brands may not achieve the level of sales or profitability that justify our investment in them
 or an acquired company may have unidentified liabilities for which we
 as a successor owner
 may be responsible. These transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial and other challenges
 including the existence of unknown disputes
 liabilities
 or contingencies and changes in the industry
 location
 or regulatory or political environment in which these investments are located
The success of any acquisitions we complete will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired brands or products into our existing operations. We may experience difficulty entering new categories or geographies
 integrating new products into our product mix
 integrating an acquired brand's distribution channels and sales force
 achieving anticipated cost savings
 or retaining key personnel and customers of the acquired business. Integrating an acquired brand into our existing operations requires management resources and may divert management's attention from our day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in integrating the operations of acquired brands
 or in executing strategies and business plans related to our joint ventures
We may have to pay cash
 incur debt
 or issue equity
 equity-linked
 or debt securities to pay for any such acquisition
A key element of our growth strategy is to introduce new and appealing products and to successfully innovate on our existing products. Success in product development is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer preferences
 and to utilize our management's ability to launch new or improved products successfully and on a cost-effective basis. Furthermore
 the development and introduction of new products requires substantial marketing expenditures
 which we may not be able to finance or which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not achieve commercial success and gain widespread market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in our product innovation efforts
Reduced availability of raw materials and other inputs
 as well as increased costs for our raw materials and other inputs
Our business depends heavily on raw materials
 such as conventional and organic raw milk
 used in the production of our products. Our raw materials are generally sourced from third-party suppliers
 and we are not assured of continued supply
 pricing
 or exclusive access to raw materials from any of these suppliers. In addition
 a substantial portion of our raw materials are agricultural products
 which are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters
 such as floods
 droughts
 frost
 earthquakes
 and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters also can lower dairy and crop yields and reduce supplies of these ingredients or increase their prices. Other events that adversely affect our third-party suppliers and that are out of our control could also impair our ability to obtain the raw materials and other inputs that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers' businesses
 finances
 labor relations
 costs
 production
 insurance
The organic ingredients (including milk) we use in some of our products&nbsp;are less plentiful and available from a fewer number of suppliers than their conventional counterparts. Competition with other manufacturers in the procurement of organic product ingredients may increase in the future if consumer demand for organic products increases. In addition
 the dairy industry continues to experience periodic imbalances between supply and demand for organic raw milk. Industry regulation and the costs of organic farming compared to costs of conventional farming can impact the supply of organic raw milk in the market. Oversupply levels of organic raw milk can increase competitive pressure on our products and pricing
 while supply shortages can cause higher input costs and reduce our ability to deliver product to our customers. Cost increases in raw materials and other inputs could cause our profits to decrease significantly compared to prior periods
 as we may be unable to increase our prices to offset the increased cost of these raw materials and other inputs. If we are unable to obtain raw materials and other inputs for our products or offset any increased costs for such raw materials and inputs
The success of our business depends
 in part
 on maintaining a strong production platform and we rely primarily on internal production resources to fulfill our manufacturing needs. Certain of our manufacturing plants are operating at high rates of utilization
 and we may need to expand our production facilities or increase our reliance on third parties to provide manufacturing and supply services
 commonly referred to as co-packing agreements
 for a number of our products. A failure by any future co-packers to comply with food safety
 environmental
 or other laws and regulations may disrupt our supply of products. In addition
 we have experienced
 and expect to continue to experience
If we need to enter into co-packing
 warehousing or distribution agreements in the future
 we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find acceptable third party providers or enter into agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. Our inability to maintain sufficient internal capacity or establish satisfactory co-packing
 warehousing and distribution arrangements could limit our ability to operate our business or implement our strategic growth plan
In addition
 our recent initiatives to expand our production platform and our productive capacity
 could fail to achieve such objectives and in any case could increase our operating costs beyond our expectations and could require significant additional capital expenditures. If we cannot maintain sufficient production
 warehousing and distribution capacity
 either internally or through third party agreements
 we may be unable to meet customer demand and/or our manufacturing
 distribution and warehousing costs may increase
Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather
 natural disaster
 fire
 environmental incident
 terrorism
 pandemic
 strikes
 the financial or operational instability of key suppliers
 distributors
 warehousing
 and transportation providers
 or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. In addition
 most of our products are processed in a single facility
 and damage or disruption to this facility could impair our ability to process and sell those products. If we are unable or it is not financially feasible to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events
As of December 31
 2015
 we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $8 million substantially all of which consists of term loan borrowings. We also had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $5 million under our line of credit
 of which none was outstanding as of December 31
limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital
 capital expenditures and acquisitions
Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance
 which will be affected by the other risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we do not generate enough cash flow to pay our debt service obligations
 we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt
 sell our assets
 borrow more money or raise equity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis
 on terms satisfactory to us
Our notes bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase
 it will increase our debt service requirements
These restrictions on the operation of our business could harm us by
 among other things
 limiting our ability to take advantage of financing
 merger and acquisition opportunities
 and other corporate opportunities. Various risks
 uncertainties
 and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Unless cured or waived
We may need additional financing in the future
From time to time
 we may need additional financing to support our business and pursue our growth strategy
 including strategic acquisitions. Our ability to obtain additional financing
 if and when required
 will depend on investor demand
 our operating performance
 the condition of the capital markets
 and other factors.&nbsp; We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required
 or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity
 equity-linked
 or debt securities
 those securities may have rights
 preferences
 or privileges senior to those of our common stock
 and
 in the case of equity and equity-linked securities
We intend to expand distribution of our products worldwide. Risks associated with our operations as we expand outside of the United States may include
legal and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions that differ from those in the United States and change from time to time
 such as tax
 labor
 and trade laws
 as well as laws that affect our ability to manufacture
 market
political and economic instability
If one or more of these business risks occur
Loss of our key management or other personnel
 or an inability to attract such management and other personnel
We depend on the skills
 working relationships
 and continued services of key personnel
 including our experienced senior management team. We also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we lose one or more members of our senior management team
 or if we fail to attract talented new employees
Our workforce could become unionized in the future
Our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union and certain of our employees have undertaken the process of forming a union. If our employees form or affiliate with a union and the terms of a union collective bargaining agreement are significantly different from our current compensation and job assignment arrangements with our employees
Our intellectual property rights are valuable
We consider our intellectual property rights
 particularly our trademarks
 but also our trade secrets
 copyrights
 and licenses
 to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark
 copyright
 and trade secret laws
 as well as licensing agreements
 third-party confidentiality
 nondisclosure
 and assignment agreements
 and by policing third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights
 or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property
We also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties' intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement
 even those without merit
 could be expensive and time consuming to defend
 cause us to cease making
 licensing
 or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property
 require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging
 divert management's attention and resources
 or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a third party's intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements
 if required
 may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally
 a successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages
 enter into costly license or royalty agreements
 or stop the sale of certain products
We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. In the opinion of management
 the resolution of current litigation claims and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate
 if possible
 the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates
 we establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings
 as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates. If actual outcomes or losses differ materially from our current assessments and estimates or additional litigation or legal proceedings are initiated
Our business is subject to various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations
Our business operations are subject to numerous requirements in the United States relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters
 including the Clean Air Act
 the Clean Water Act
 the Comprehensive Environmental Response
 Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
 as amended
 and the National Organic Standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
 as well as similar state and local statutes and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries in which we do business in Europe. These laws and regulations govern
 among other things
 air emissions and the discharge of wastewater and other pollutants
 the use of refrigerants
 the handling and disposal of hazardous materials
We could incur significant costs
 including fines
 penalties and other sanctions
 cleanup costs
 and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of the failure to comply with
 or liabilities under
 environmental
 health
 and safety requirements. New legislation
 as well as current federal and other state regulatory initiatives relating to these environmental matters
 could require us to replace equipment
 install additional pollution controls
 purchase various emission allowances
Violations of laws or regulations related to the food industry
 as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations related to the food industry
The food production and marketing industry is subject to a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign laws and regulations
 including food safety requirements related to the ingredients
 manufacture
 processing
 storage
 marketing
 advertising
 labeling
 and distribution of our products
 as well as those related to worker health and workplace safety. Our activities
 both in and outside of the United States
 are subject to extensive regulation. We are regulated by
 among other federal and state authorities
 the U.S. FDA
 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
 and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture
 Commerce
 and Labor
 as well as by similar authorities abroad within the regulatory framework of the European Union and its members. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies
 healthcare costs
 energy usage
 immigration
 and other labor issues
In addition
 the marketing and advertising of our products could make us the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal
 state
 and foreign laws and regulations
We are also subject to federal laws and regulations relating to our organic products and production. For example
 as required by the National Organic Program (NOP)
 we rely on third parties to certify certain of our products and production locations as organic. Because the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990
 which created the NOP
 was so recently adopted
Changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase our compliance costs
 increase other costs of doing business for us
 our customers
 or our suppliers
 or restrict our actions
 which could adversely affect our results of operations. In some cases
 increased regulatory scrutiny could interrupt distribution of our products
 as could be the case in the United States as the FDA enacts the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011
 or force changes in our production processes and our products. Further
 if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations in these areas
 we could be subject to civil remedies
 including fines
 injunctions
 or recalls
 as well as potential criminal sanctions

Furthermore
 our directors and officers
 as a group
 which own in excess of 49.8% of our issued and outstanding common stock have the ability to significantly influence or control the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval
 including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions
 such as mergers
This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our common stock. In addition
 without the consent of the Smolyansky Family
We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Our failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements
 our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information
We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A description of the material weaknesses can be found in Item 9A of this report. As a result of such weaknesses
 our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31
Unless and until these material weaknesses have been remediated
 or should new material weaknesses arise or be discovered in the future material misstatements could occur and go undetected in the Company's interim or annual consolidated financial statements and we may be required to restate our financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition
 we may experience delays in satisfying our reporting obligations or to comply with SEC rules and regulations

 2015
 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $3.5 million of the Company's common stock not to exceed an aggregate of 250
000 shares
 in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
 in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations
 including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon a variety of factors
 including market conditions
 regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations
 as determined by management. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three and twelvemonths ended December 31
 2015 the company acquired 136 shares at an aggregate cost of $1
At December 31
 2015
 the Company had $840 of current maturities of notes payable. The Company also has a $5 million revolving credit facility with The Private Bank. This facility
 which unless renewed expires in July 2016
 remained unused at December 31
In July 2013
 we purchased certain assets of&nbsp;Golden Guernsey located in Waukesha Wisconsin. The Golden Guernsey assets position us to scale-up our kefir producing capacity in tandem with future growth and provide us with an additional production platform that we believe creates greater supply chain productivity and flexibility opportunities. Beyond kefir production
 this new facility also vertically extends Lifeway into milk processing and bottle manufacturing operations
 both of which historically had been sourced from unaffiliated third party suppliers. Our milk processing
 which consists of converting raw milk into conventional milk
On March 14

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates
 judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expenses. US GAAP provides the framework from which to make these estimates
 judgments and assumptions. We believe our estimates
 judgments and assumptions are reasonable; however
 future results could differ from those estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management regularly assesses its accounting policies and has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies with its Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. For further information concerning accounting policies
.&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are not subject to amortization but rather is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on the market capitalization of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates
 weighted average cost of capital
 and assumed royalty rates. If our estimate of fair value is less than the carrying value
As of December 31
 2015 we had $10.4 million of goodwill and the market capitalization of the Company exceeded its carrying value by more than 100%. As of December 31
From time to time
 we grant certain sales discounts to customers which are classified as a reduction in sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;The measurement and recognition of discounts and allowances involves the use of judgment and our estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31
.&nbsp;&nbsp;We pay income taxes based on tax statutes
 regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;At any one time
We do not undertake any specific actions to diminish our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foreign sales are not material.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly
As of December 31
 2015
 we had an outstanding balance under our bank&nbsp;term loans of approximately $8.0 million
 and we have the option to borrow an additional $5 million from our line of credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The term loans bear interest at variable rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the outstanding amount under such loans at December 31
 2015 of approximately $8.0 million (which remains outstanding as of the time of this filing) a 1.0 percent increase in interest rates would result in additional annualized interest expense of approximately $80.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a detailed discussion of our loans
 including a discussion of the applicable interest rate

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Lifeway Foods
During fiscal 2014
 adjustments to correct the accounting for certain items related to periods prior to 2014
 in the aggregate
 decreased income before provision for income taxes by approximately $600
000 and net income by approximately $400
000 for the year ended December 31
 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These errors related to an understatement of accrued expenses and the provision for income taxes arising primarily from inaccurate accounting for certain employee
 including officer
&nbsp;expense reports and an understatement of depreciation expense arising from assigning &nbsp;incorrect useful lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company determined these adjustments to be immaterial
 individually and in the aggregate
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include the reserve for promotional allowances
 the fair value of investment securities
 the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets
The Company records sales&nbsp;when the following four criteria have been met: (i) The product has been shipped and the Company has no significant remaining obligations; (ii) Persuasive evidence of an agreement exists; (iii) The price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (iv) Collection is probable. In addition
The Company routinely offers sales allowances and discounts to our customers and consumers. These programs include rebates
 in-store display and demo allowances
 allowances for non-salable product
Bulk cream is a by-product of the Company's fluid milk manufacturing process. The Company does not use bulk cream in any of its end products
All investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity to the extent they are considered temporary in nature. Amortization
 accretion
 interest and dividends
 realized gains and losses
Inventories are stated at the lower of first in
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized
 but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. The Company amortizes other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives
The Company reviews intangible assets&nbsp;for impairment&nbsp;at least once per year to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company conducts more frequent impairment assessments if certain conditions exist
 such as a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions to pursue new or different strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
If the estimated remaining useful life of an intangible asset is changed
Deferred income taxes are the result of temporary differences that arise from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current
The principal sources of temporary differences are different depreciation and amortization methods for financial statement and tax purposes
 unrealized gains or losses related to investments
 capitalization of indirect costs for tax purposes
 purchase price adjustments
The Company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns
 as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. Periods subject to examination for the Company's federal income tax returns are the 2012
 2013 and 2014 tax years. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that
 if recognized
 would impact the annual effective tax rate was not significant as of December 31
 2015 and 2014. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements
 tax examination activities
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31
 2015
 2014 and 2013 total advertising expenses were $5
006
 $3
875
 and $2

Earnings per common share were computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.For the years ended December 31
 2015 2014
 and 2013
In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09)
 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605
 Revenue Recognition
 including most industry-specific requirements. ASU 2014-09 establishes a five-step revenue recognition process in which an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. In August 2015 the FASB delayed the effective date for implementation of ASU 2014-09. Under the delayed effective date
 the Company is required to adopt the new standard not later than January 1
 2018. Management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial position
 results of operations or cash flows and the method of retrospective application
In July 2015
 the FASB issued new accounting guidance for measuring inventory. The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. This guidance does not apply to inventory that is being measured using the Last-In
 First-Out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
In November 2015
 the FASB issued new guidance regarding the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. This new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities
 along with any related valuation allowance
 be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Previous guidance required deferred tax assets and liabilities to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2016
In January
 2016
 the FASB issued new guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The new guidance modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Under the new guidance
 entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless certain conditions exist. The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
In February 2016
 the FASB issued new guidance regarding leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15

We have audited Lifeway Foods
 Inc. and Subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2015
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
The financial statement preparation process requires the involvement of a small team of company employees and the preparation process lacks sufficient
The Company has not consistently demonstrated effective preparation
Accounting for income taxes &#8211; The Company did not have adequate design of controls that provide reasonable assurance that the accounting for income taxes&nbsp;was in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Specifically
These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature
 timing
 and the extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31
 2015
 and this report does not affect our report dated March 15
In our opinion
 issued by COSO
 the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31

On June 20
 2014
 the Registrant engaged Crowe Horwath LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31
 2014. The engagement was approved by the Audit Committee and the Board. During the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 and the subsequent interim period prior to the engagement of Crowe Horwath LLP
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure material information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive officer
 principal financial officer and principal accounting officer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures
 we recognize that a control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
As of the end of the period covered by this report
 we conducted an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)). Based on this evaluation
 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31
 2015 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the Exchange Act rules and forms due to the material weaknesses described below. As a result
 we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly
 management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K fairly present
 in all material respects
 our financial condition
The attestation report of Mayer Hoffman &amp; McCann
 the company's independent registered public accounting firm
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is identified in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 our principal executive officer

 in reasonable detail
provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our consolidated&nbsp;financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
Management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
 assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2015. In making this assessment
 management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment
 management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2015
 due to the fact that certain material weaknesses previously identified in the 2014 Form 10-K filing on August 14
 2015 continue to exist at December 31
 2015
A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
Material Weaknesses as of December 31
The financial statement preparation process requires the involvement of a small team of company employees and the preparation process lacks sufficient
The Company has not consistently demonstrated effective preparation
Accounting for income taxes - The Company did not have adequate design of controls that provide reasonable assurance that the accounting for income taxes&nbsp;was in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Specifically
During 2015
 we increased the size of our accounting department and revised the competency requirements for our team. Enabled by those foundational changes
 we have eliminated our reliance on most of the accounting and reporting activities that were previously completed by third-party service providers. Among other things
All of our journal entries and most of our account reconciliations are now prepared and reviewed by company personnel
 with significantly reduced involvement of the third-party serviced providers. Further
 compliance with our updated journal entry and account reconciliation policies has been consistently emphasized with our team and compliance and timeliness has improved significantly. In 2016
With the addition of our new VP of Finance
 during 2015 we demonstrated a more consistent
 thorough and effective review over the accounting for income taxes
 reducing our reliance on the third-party service providers. In 2016
We have made remediation of our material weaknesses a top priority at Lifeway and we are committed to continually improving our internal controls over financial reporting. During 2015 and continuing through the date of this filing
During December 2014
 the Company identified and engaged an outside consultant to perform the function of internal audit.&nbsp; In 2015
 the consultant assisted us in documenting
During December 2014
 the newly established Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Committee) hired outside advisors to advise the Committee and the Company on developing and/or changing processes
 procedures and policies related to compensation practices
 including expense reimbursement. During 2015
During 2015
 the Audit Committee met with management and MHM on a frequent basis to review matters of accounting
 financial reporting and internal control. Among other things
In July 2015
 the Company hired a Vice President of Finance with public company reporting experience and hired an assistant to the controller.&nbsp; These additions to the Company's management and staff were made to enable more effective and consistent leadership and organizational focus on accounting
We implemented a process for ensuring that all fixed asset additions are timely identified and recorded and that such additions are assigned the proper useful life and are placed in service in the proper accounting period. The new process is operated by our accounting staff with significantly reduced reliance on a third-party accounting service provider. We also performed more timely reconciliations of our fixed asset subsidiary records to our general ledger. In 2016
 we intend to implement a new fixed asset system
In tandem with updating its travel and expense policies
 the Company has implemented a third-party software solution for processing expense reports that provides an effective and efficient monitoring tool over the timeliness of expense report submissions and reinforces compliance with Company's substantiation requirements and spending limits.
 We have also established a routine of on-going
 independent review and approval of expense reimbursement requests. Further
We believe that the remediation measures discussed above will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses we have identified. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal controls over financial reporting
 we may determine that additional measures are necessary to address control deficiencies. Moreover
Except as discussed above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#34;FASB&amp;#34;) issued ASU No. 2014-09
 &amp;#34;Revenue from Contracts with&#13;Customers (Topic 606)&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;ASU 2014-09&amp;#34;)
 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605
 Revenue&#13;Recognition
 including most industry-specific requirements. ASU 2014-09 establishes a five-step revenue recognition process in&#13;which an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the&#13;consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires enhanced&#13;disclosures regarding the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. In&#13;August 2015 the FASB delayed the effective date for implementation of ASU 2014-09. Under the delayed effective date
 the Company&#13;is required to adopt the new standard not later than January 1
 2018. Management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption&#13;of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial position
 results of operations or cash flows and the method&#13;of retrospective application

 the FASB issued new accounting guidance for measuring inventory. The core principal of the guidance is that an entity&#13;should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in&#13;the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. This guidance&#13;does not apply to inventory that is being measured using the Last-In
 First-Out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The guidance&#13;is effective for financial statements issued for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued new guidance regarding the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. This new guidance requires&#13;that all deferred tax assets and liabilities
 along with any related valuation allowance
 be classified as noncurrent on the balance&#13;sheet. Previous guidance required deferred tax assets and liabilities to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the&#13;balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2016

 2016
 the FASB issued new guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.&#13;The new guidance modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities.&#13;Under the new guidance
 entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted&#13;under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless certain conditions exist. The&#13;new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15

 the FASB issued&#13;new guidance regarding leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on&#13;the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease&#13;liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance is&#13;effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15

Amount due from customers

 or other third-parties
 or arising from transactions not separately disclosed
 within one year of the balance sheet date (or the normal operating cycle
 whichever is longer)
 net of allowances established for the purpose of reducing such receivables to an amount that approximates their net realizable value.

























































Amount due from customers or clients
 within one year of the balance sheet date (or the normal operating cycle
 whichever is longer)
 for goods or services (including trade receivables) that have been delivered or sold in the normal course of business
 reduced to the estimated net realizable fair value by an allowance established by the entity of the amount it deems uncertain of collection.




























Amount due from customers or clients
 more than one year from the balance sheet date
 for goods or services that have been delivered or sold in the normal course of business
 reduced to the estimated net realizable fair value by an allowance established by the entity of the amount it deems uncertain of collection.

























































Carrying value as of the balance sheet date of obligations incurred and payable
 pertaining to costs that are statutory in nature
 are incurred on contractual obligations
 or accumulate over time and for which invoices have not yet been received or will not be rendered. Examples include taxes
 interest
 rent and utilities. Used to reflect the current portion of the liabilities (due within one year or within the normal operating cycle if longer).




























Accumulated change in equity from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources
 net of tax effect
 at period end. Excludes Net Income (Loss)
 and accumulated changes in equity from transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Includes foreign currency translation items
 certain pension adjustments
 unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities
 other than temporary impairment (OTTI) losses related to factors other than credit losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities that an entity does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis
 as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives related to the effective portion of a designated cash flow hedge.




























Excess of issue price over par or stated value of the entity's capital stock and amounts received from other transactions involving the entity's stock or stockholders. Includes adjustments to additional paid in capital. Some examples of such adjustments include recording the issuance of debt with a beneficial conversion feature and certain tax consequences of equity instruments awarded to employees. Use this element for the aggregate amount of additional paid-in capital associated with common and preferred stock. For additional paid-in capital associated with only common stock
 use the element additional paid in capital
 common stock. For additional paid-in capital associated with only preferred stock
 use the element additional paid in capital
 preferred stock.

























































Sum of the carrying amounts as of the balance sheet date of all assets that are expected to be realized in cash
 sold
 or consumed within one year (or the normal operating cycle
 if longer). Assets are probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by an entity as a result of past transactions or events.
























































Amount of currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. Includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits. Also includes short-term
 highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Excludes cash and cash equivalents within disposal group and discontinued operation.




























A savings certificate entitling the Entity (that is
 bearer) to receive interest at an established maturity date
 based upon a fixed interest rate.  A certificate of deposit may be issued in any denomination. Certificates of deposit are generally issued by commercial banks and
 therefore
 insured by the FDIC (up to the prescribed limit).  Certificates of deposit generally restrict holders from withdrawing funds on demand without the incurrence of penalties.  Generally
 only certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less qualify as cash equivalents. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. As a related example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.




























Aggregate par or stated value of issued nonredeemable common stock (or common stock redeemable solely at the option of the issuer). This item includes treasury stock repurchased by the entity. Note: elements for number of nonredeemable common shares
 par value and other disclosure concepts are in another section within stockholders' equity.

 if longer.




























Amount of deferred tax liability attributable to taxable temporary differences

 if longer) from tax authorities as of the balance sheet date representing refunds of overpayments or recoveries based on agreed-upon resolutions of disputes.




























The current portion of nonphysical assets
 excluding financial assets
 if these assets are classified into the current and noncurrent portions.
























































Amount after valuation and LIFO reserves of inventory expected to be sold
 or consumed within one year or operating cycle
 if longer.

























































Amount of liabilities and equity items
 including the portion of equity attributable to noncontrolling interests
 if any.




























Total obligations incurred as part of normal operations that are expected to be paid during the following twelve months or within one business cycle
 if longer.
























































Carrying value as of the balance sheet date of notes payable (with maturities initially due after one year or beyond the operating cycle if longer)
 excluding current portion.

Our
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Lifeway Foods
 Inc. and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively
&#34;Lifeway&#34; or the &#34;Company&#34;). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Out-of-period
adjustments recorded during fiscal 2014

During fiscal
2014
 adjustments to correct the accounting for certain items related to periods prior to 2014
 in the aggregate
decreased income before provision for income taxes by approximately $600
000 and net income by approximately $400
000 for the
year ended December 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;&#160;These errors related to an understatement of accrued expenses and the provision
for income taxes arising primarily from inaccurate accounting for certain employee
 including officer
&#160;expense reports and
an understatement of depreciation expense arising from assigning &#160;incorrect useful lives.&#160;&#160;The Company determined
these adjustments to be immaterial
 individually and in the aggregate
 to our previously filed consolidated financial statements.

Use
of estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities revenues and expenses.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements
include the reserve for promotional allowances
 the fair value of investment securities
 the valuation of goodwill and intangible
assets
 and deferred taxes.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company records sales&#160;when the following four criteria have been met: (i) The product has been shipped and the Company has
no significant remaining obligations; (ii) Persuasive evidence of an agreement exists; (iii) The price to the buyer is fixed or
determinable and (iv) Collection is probable. In addition
 amounts invoiced to customers for shipping charges are included in
gross sales and the related cost in cost of goods sold.

The
Company routinely offers sales allowances and discounts to our customers and consumers. These programs include rebates
 in-store
display and demo allowances
 allowances for non-salable product
 coupons and other trade promotion activities. These allowances
are considered reductions in the price of our products and thus are recorded as reductions to gross sales. Some of these incentives
are recorded by estimating incentive costs based on our historical experience and expected levels of performance of the trade
promotion. We maintain a reserve for the estimated allowances incurred but unpaid. Differences between estimated and actual allowances
are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Product returns have
historically not been material.

Bulk
cream is a by-product of the Company's fluid milk manufacturing process. The Company does not use bulk cream in any of its end
products
 but rather disposes of it through sales to other companies. Bulk cream by-product sales are included in gross sales.

Cash
and cash equivalents

All
highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.



All
investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity to the extent they are considered temporary in nature.
Amortization
 accretion
 interest and dividends
 realized gains and losses
 and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary
on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a component of other income. This evaluation depends on the specific facts and
circumstances. Factors that we consider in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred include:
the fair value of the security in relation to its cost basis; the financial condition of the investee; and the intent and ability
to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for possible recovery in the fair value of the investment.



Inventories
are stated at the lower of first in
 first out cost or market.&#160;&#160;

Property
and equipment

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense
as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.

Property
and equipment is being depreciated over the following useful lives:



    
    
    

Buildings
    and improvements
    
31
    and 39

Machinery

Leasehold

Shorter

Goodwill
and other intangible assets 

Intangible
assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill
represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets acquired.
Goodwill is not amortized
 but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. The Company amortizes other intangible assets over
their estimated useful lives
 as disclosed in the table below.

The
Company reviews intangible assets&#160;for impairment&#160;at least once per year to determine if any adverse conditions exist
that would indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company conducts more frequent impairment assessments
if certain conditions exist
 such as a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions to pursue new or different
strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
 or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid
for the Company's products or changes in the size of the market for the Company's products.

If
the estimated remaining useful life of an intangible asset is changed
 the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is
amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.

Intangible
assets are being amortized over the following useful lives:



    
    
    

    
    
    

Trade
    names
    
    

    
    
    

Customer
    lists
    
    

Customer
    relationships
    
    


Income
taxes

Deferred
income taxes are the result of temporary differences that arise from income and expense items reported for financial accounting
and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current
 depending on the classification
of the assets and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to
an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are
expected to reverse.

The
principal sources of temporary differences are different depreciation and amortization methods for financial statement and tax
purposes
 unrealized gains or losses related to investments
 capitalization of indirect costs for tax purposes
 purchase price
adjustments
 and the allowance for doubtful accounts.

The
Company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns
as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. Periods subject to examination for the Company's federal income tax returns
are the 2012
 2013 and 2014 tax years. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that
 if recognized
 would impact the annual effective
tax rate was not significant as of December 31
 2015 and 2014. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to
audit settlements
 tax examination activities
 statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes.

Treasury
stock

Treasury
stock is recorded using the cost method.

Advertising
costs

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31
 2015
 2014 and 2013 total advertising expenses
were $5
006
 $3
875
 and $2
686
 respectively.

Earnings
per common share

Earnings
per common share were computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. For the years ended December 31
 2015 2014
 and 2013
 there were no common stock
equivalents outstanding.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#34;FASB&#34;) issued ASU No. 2014-09
 &#34;Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606)&#34; (&#34;ASU 2014-09&#34;)
 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605
 Revenue
Recognition
 including most industry-specific requirements. ASU 2014-09 establishes a five-step revenue recognition process in
which an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires enhanced
disclosures regarding the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. In
August 2015 the FASB delayed the effective date for implementation of ASU 2014-09. Under the delayed effective date
 the Company
is required to adopt the new standard not later than January 1
 2018. Management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption
of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial position
 results of operations or cash flows and the method
of retrospective application
 either full or modified.

In
July 2015
 the FASB issued new accounting guidance for measuring inventory. The core principal of the guidance is that an entity
should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in
the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. This guidance
does not apply to inventory that is being measured using the Last-In
 First-Out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The guidance
is effective for financial statements issued for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016 on a prospective
basis. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact this will have on the consolidated financial
statements.

In
November 2015
 the FASB issued new guidance regarding the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. This new guidance requires
that all deferred tax assets and liabilities
 along with any related valuation allowance
 be classified as noncurrent on the balance
sheet. Previous guidance required deferred tax assets and liabilities to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the
balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within
those years. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

In
January
 2016
 the FASB issued new guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
The new guidance modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities.
Under the new guidance
 entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted
under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless certain conditions exist. The
new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2017 and interim periods within those years.
Early adoption of the guidance is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have
on the consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016
 the FASB issued
new guidance regarding leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on
the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease
liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those
years. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

The Company's investments in equity
securities
 mutual funds
 and corporate bonds consist of investments in common stock
 preferred stock
 structured notes and other
debt securities of companies in various industries. The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses of approximately
$475 during fiscal 2015 with respect to certain structured notes. The impairment losses are included in &#34;other income (expense)&#34;
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The structured notes allow the issuer to settle
at an amount less than par in certain circumstances. In reaching a conclusion to record these other-than-temporary impairment
losses
 the Company evaluated the near-term prospects of the issuers and determined it was probable the issuers would have the
ability to settle the bonds for an amount less than par value at maturity.

Financial
 (&#34;ASC&#34;) 820

Measurements and Disclosures
 provides the framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC
820 are described as follows:

Level
Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets
that the Company has the ability to access.

Level
2. 



    
Quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

    
Quoted prices for
    identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;

    
Inputs other than
    quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;

    
Inputs that are
    derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.


If
the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term
 the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term
of the asset or liability.

Level
3. 

The
asset or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that
is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs.

Following
is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There have been no
changes in the methodologies used as of December 31
 2015 and 2014.

The
majority of the Company's fair value measurements for investments are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair
value hierarchy. The Company's Level 1 fair value measurements
 which include mutual funds
 common stock and exchange traded
funds (ETF's)
 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical securities. The Company's Level 2 fair
value measurements
 which include corporate bonds
 is based on quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar
assets. The company's level 3 fair value measurements which include other than temporarily impaired bonds are based on the
present value of the estimated proceeds expected to be received at maturity of the bond. Those bonds were reclassified to
level 3 from level 2 during 2015.

The
preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective
of future fair values. Furthermore
 although the Company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other
market participants
 the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments
could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The
following table sets forth by level
 within the fair value hierarchy
 the Company's financial assets measured at fair value on
a recurring basis for the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014. The assets presented here are classified in their entirety based
on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement:

In
December 2015
 Lifeway shareholders approved the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan
 which authorized the issuance of an aggregate
of 3.5 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 unrestricted stock
 restricted stock
restricted stock units
 performance shares and performance units. The Company has not established a pace for the frequency of
awards under the Omnibus plan
 and may choose to suspend the issuance of new awards in the future and may grant additional
awards at any time including issuing special grants of restricted stock
 restricted stock units and stock options to attract
and retain new and existing executives.&#160;

Pursuant
to the Omnibus Incentive Plan
 Lifeway granted 26 stock options to certain key employees of the company effective January 1
 2016
(the &#34;2016 options&#34;). The 2016 options generally vest over a three-year period
 on a relatively accelerated basis. The
accelerated vesting reflects the landmark nature of the awards and the relative tenure of individual participants. Total stock
based compensation arising from this award
 which will be recognized in periods subsequent to 2015 is approximately $60.

There was no stock
based compensation expense in each of the three years ending December 31
 2015
 2014 and 2013. There were no options
restricted stock or other equity instruments awarded or outstanding at any time during  each of the three years ending
December 31
 2015
 2014 and 2013.

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities revenues and expenses. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include the reserve
for promotional allowances
 the fair value of investment securities
 the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets
 and deferred
taxes.




The
Company records sales&#160;when the following four criteria have been met: (i) The product has been shipped and the Company has
no significant remaining obligations; (ii) Persuasive evidence of an agreement exists; (iii) The price to the buyer is fixed or
determinable and (iv) Collection is probable. In addition
 amounts invoiced to customers for shipping charges are included in
gross sales and the related cost in cost of goods sold.

The
Company routinely offers sales allowances and discounts to our customers and consumers. These programs include rebates
 in-store
display and demo allowances
 allowances for non-salable product
 coupons and other trade promotion activities. These allowances
are considered reductions in the price of our products and thus are recorded as reductions to gross sales. Some of these incentives
are recorded by estimating incentive costs based on our historical experience and expected levels of performance of the trade
promotion. We maintain a reserve for the estimated allowances incurred but unpaid. Differences between estimated and actual allowances
are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Product returns have
historically not been material.

Bulk cream
is a by-product of the Company's fluid milk manufacturing process. The Company does not use bulk cream in any of its end products
but rather disposes of it through sales to other companies. Bulk cream by-product sales are included in gross sales.




All highly
liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.




All investment
securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity to the extent they are considered temporary in nature.
Amortization
 accretion
 interest and dividends
 realized gains and losses
 and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary
on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a component of other income. This evaluation depends on the specific facts and
circumstances. Factors that we consider in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred include:
the fair value of the security in relation to its cost basis; the financial condition of the investee; and the intent and ability
to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for possible recovery in the fair value of the investment.




Inventories
are stated at the lower of first in
 first out cost or market.




Property
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense
as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.

Property
and equipment is being depreciated over the following useful lives:



    
    
    

Buildings
    and improvements
    
31
    and 39

Machinery
    and equipment
    
5
    - 12

Office
    equipment
    
5
    - 7

    
    
    

Leasehold
    improvements
    
Shorter
    of expected useful life or lease term





Intangible
assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill
represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets acquired.
Goodwill is not amortized
 but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. The Company amortizes other intangible assets over
their estimated useful lives
 as disclosed in the table below.

The
Company reviews intangible assets&#160;for impairment&#160;at least once per year to determine if any adverse conditions exist
that would indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company conducts more frequent impairment assessments
if certain conditions exist
 such as a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions to pursue new or different
strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
 or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid
for the Company's products or changes in the size of the market for the Company's products.

If
the estimated remaining useful life of an intangible asset is changed
 the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is
amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.

Intangible
assets are being amortized over the following useful lives:



    
    
    

    
    
    

Trade
    names
    
    

    
    
    

Customer
    lists
    
    

Customer
    relationships
    
    





Deferred
income taxes are the result of temporary differences that arise from income and expense items reported for financial accounting
and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current
 depending on the classification
of the assets and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to
an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are
expected to reverse.

The
principal sources of temporary differences are different depreciation and amortization methods for financial statement and tax
purposes
 unrealized gains or losses related to investments
 capitalization of indirect costs for tax purposes
 purchase price
adjustments
  and the allowance for doubtful accounts.

The Company
has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns
 as
well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. Periods subject to examination for the Company's federal income tax returns
are the 2012
 2013 and 2014 tax years. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that
 if recognized
 would impact the annual effective
tax rate was not significant as of December 31
 2015 and 2014. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to
audit settlements
 tax examination activities
 statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes.




Treasury stock
is recorded using the cost method.




The Company
expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31
 2015
 2014 and 2013 total advertising expenses were $5
006
$3
875
 and $2
686
 respectively.




Earnings
per common share were computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. For the years ended December 31
 2015 2014
 and 2013
 there were no common stock
equivalents outstanding.




In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#34;FASB&#34;) issued ASU No. 2014-09
 &#34;Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606)&#34; (&#34;ASU 2014-09&#34;)
 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605
 Revenue Recognition
including most industry-specific requirements. ASU 2014-09 establishes a five-step revenue recognition process in which an entity
will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires enhanced disclosures
regarding the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. In August 2015
the FASB delayed the effective date for implementation of ASU 2014-09. Under the delayed effective date
 the Company is required
to adopt the new standard not later than January 1
 2018. Management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09
will have on the Company's consolidated financial position
 results of operations or cash flows and the method of retrospective
application
 either full or modified.

In
July 2015
 the FASB issued new accounting guidance for measuring inventory. The core principal of the guidance is that an entity
should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in
the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. This guidance
does not apply to inventory that is being measured using the Last-In
 First-Out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The guidance
is effective for financial statements issued for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016 on a prospective
basis. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact this will have on the consolidated financial
statements.

In
November 2015
 the FASB issued new guidance regarding the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. This new guidance requires
that all deferred tax assets and liabilities
 along with any related valuation allowance
 be classified as noncurrent on the balance
sheet. Previous guidance required deferred tax assets and liabilities to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the
balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within
those years. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

In
January
 2016
 the FASB issued new guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.&#34;
The new guidance modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities.
Under the new guidance
 entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted
under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless certain conditions exist. The
new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2017 and interim periods within those years.
Early adoption of the guidance is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have
on the consolidated financial statements.

In February
2016
 the FASB issued new guidance regarding leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that
arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease
payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim
periods within those years. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated
financial statements.
