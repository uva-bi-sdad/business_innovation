&#160;&#160;coffee roasted

 including supermarkets that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and



















Our private label and branded coffee products are sold throughout the United States
 Canada and certain countries in Asia to supermarkets
 wholesalers
 and individually owned and multi-unit retail customers.&#160;&#160;Our unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is sold to specialty gourmet roasters.

We conduct our operations in accordance with strict freshness and quality standards.&#160;&#160;All of our private label and branded coffees are produced from high quality coffee beans that are deep roasted for full flavor using a slow roasting process that has been perfected utilizing our more than thirty years of experience in the coffee industry.&#160;&#160;In order to ensure freshness
 our products are delivered to our customers within 72 hours of roasting.&#160;&#160;We believe that our long history has enabled us to develop a loyal customer base.


We were incorporated on October 9
 1995 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name Transpacific International Group Corp (&#8220;Transpacific&#8221;).&#160;&#160;On April 16
 1998
 Transpacific completed a merger with Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc.
 a New York corporation. Upon the consummation of the merger
 Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. was merged into Transpacific and Transpacific changed its name to Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc.

Our corporate offices are located at 3475 Victory Boulevard
 Staten Island
 New York 10314.&#160;&#160;Our telephone number is (718) 832-0800 and our website address is www.coffeeholding.com.&#160;&#160;The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



To achieve our growth objectives described below
 we intend to leverage the following competitive strengths:

We believe that we are one of the few coffee companies to offer a broad array of branded and private label roasted ground coffees and wholesale green coffee across the spectrum of consumer tastes
 preferences and price points.&#160;&#160;While many of our competitors engage in distinct segments of the coffee business
 we sell products in each of the following areas:

























































































































Our branded and private label roasted ground coffees are sold at competitive and value price levels while some of our other branded and specialty coffees are sold predominantly at premium price levels.&#160;&#160;Premium price level coffee is high-quality gourmet coffee
 such as AA Arabica coffee
 which sell at a substantial premium over traditional retail canned coffee
 while competitive and value price level coffee is mainstream or traditional canned coffee.&#160;&#160;Because of this diversification
 we believe that our profitability is not dependent on any one area of the coffee industry and
 therefore
 is less sensitive than our competition to potential coffee commodity price and overall economic volatility.
















&#160;&#160;As a large roaster-dealer of green coffee
 we believe that we are favorably positioned to increase our specialty coffee sales.&#160;&#160;Since 1998
 we have increased the number of our wholesale green coffee customers
 including coffee houses
 single store operators
 mall coffee stores and mail order sellers
 by 310% from 150 to 465.&#160;&#160;We are a charter member of the Specialty Coffee Association of America and one of the largest distributors of Swiss Water Processed Decaffeinated Coffees along the east coast.&#160;&#160;In addition
 although we do not have any formalized
 material agreements or long-term contracts with Keurig Green Mountain
 Inc.&#160;&#160;(&#8220;GMCR&#8221;)
 we have a 20 year relationship with GMCR
 our largest wholesale green coffee customer.&#160;&#160;Our over 40 years of experience as a roaster and a dealer of green coffee allows us to provide our roasting experience as a value added service to our gourmet roaster customers.&#160;&#160;The assistance we provide to our customers includes training
 coffee blending and market identification.&#160;&#160;We believe that our relationships with wholesale green coffee customers and our focus on selling green coffee as a wholesaler has enabled us to participate in the growth of the specialty coffee market while mitigating the risks associated with the competitive retail specialty coffee environment.

We have amassed a portfolio of five proprietary name brands sold to supermarkets
 wholesalers and individually owned stores in the United States
 including brands for specialty espresso
 Latin espresso
 Italian espresso
 100% Colombian coffee and blended coffee.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we have entered into a licensing agreement with Del Monte Corporation for the exclusive right to use the S&amp;W and IL CLASSICO trademarks in the United States and other countries approved by Del Monte Corporation in connection with the production
 manufacture and sale of roasted whole bean and ground coffee for distribution to retail customers.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our existing portfolio of differentiated brands combined with our management expertise serve as a platform to add additional name brands through acquisition or licensing agreements which target product niches and segments that do not compete with our existing brands.

&#160;&#160;We have been a family-operated business for three generations.&#160;&#160;Throughout this time
 we have remained strong through varying cycles in the coffee industry and the economy.&#160;&#160;Andrew Gordon
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President &#8211; Operations
 have worked with Coffee Holding for 33 and 35 years
 respectively.&#160;&#160;David Gordon is an original member of the Specialty Coffee Association of America.&#160;&#160;We believe that our employees and management are dedicated to our vision and mission
 which is to produce high quality products
 as well as to provide quality and responsive service to our customers.



We believe that significant growth opportunities exist by selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances
 targeting the rapidly growing Hispanic market in the United States
 increasing penetration with existing customers by adding new products
 and developing our food service business.&#160;&#160;By capitalizing on this strategy
 we hope to continue to grow our business with our commitment to quality and personalized service to our customers.&#160;&#160;We do not intend to compete on price alone nor do we intend to expand sales at the expense of profitability.

&#160;&#160;We have expanded our operations by acquiring coffee companies
 entering into strategic alliances and acquiring or licensing brands
 which complement our business objectives and we intend to continue to seek such opportunities.&#160;&#160;

We believe the Hispanic population in the United States is the fastest growing and now represents the largest minority demographic in the United States.&#160;&#160;We believe there is significant opportunity for our Caf&#233; Caribe and Caf&#233; Supremo brands to gain market share among Hispanic consumers in the United States.&#160;&#160;Caf&#233; Caribe
 which has historically been our leading brand by poundage
 is a specialty espresso coffee that targets espresso coffee drinkers and
 in particular
 Hispanic consumers.&#160;&#160;Caf&#233; Supremo is a specialty espresso coffee which is priced for the more price sensitive Hispanic espresso coffee drinker.

&#160;&#160;We intend to capture additional market share through our existing distribution channels by selectively adding or introducing new brand names and products across multiple price points
 including:












































































&#160;&#160;We plan to expand further into the food service business by developing new distribution channels for our products.&#160;&#160;Currently
 we have a limited presence in the food service market.&#160;&#160;Food service coffee products tend to have a higher gross profit margin than our traditional supermarket product retail offerings. We have expanded our food service offerings to include instant cappuccinos
 tea products and an equipment program for our customers.&#160;&#160;We attend various annual trade shows held by different buying groups
 which provide us a national audience to market our food service products.


&#160;&#160;During 2013
 we (i) introduced our Don Manuel brand for sale in the Shanghai market through an exclusive licensing arrangement with the DTS8 Coffee Company
 Ltd.
 (ii) commenced sales of green coffee into China and (iii) continued to build upon prior sales of our S&amp;W coffee in certain countries in Asia.&#160;&#160;We intend to pursue opportunities to increase sales of our green coffee
 private label coffee and branded coffee into certain countries in Asia.















unroasted raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large

&#160;including supermarkets that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and



















&#160;&#160;The specialty coffee market represents the fastest growing area of our industry.&#160;&#160;The number of gourmet coffee houses have been increasing in all areas of the United States.&#160;&#160;The growth in specialty coffee sales has created a marketplace for higher quality and differentiated products
 which can be priced at a premium in the marketplace.&#160;&#160;As a large roaster-dealer of green coffee
 we are favorably positioned to increase our specialty coffee sales.&#160;&#160;We sell green coffee beans to small roasters and coffee shop operators located throughout the United States and carry over approximately 90 different varieties.&#160;&#160;Specialty green coffee beans are sold unroasted
 direct from warehouses to small roasters and gourmet coffee shop operators
 which then roast the beans themselves.&#160;&#160;We sell from as little as one bag (132 pounds) to a full truckload (44
000 pounds) of specialty green coffee beans
 depending on the size and need of the customer.&#160;&#160;We believe that we can increase sales of wholesale green coffee without an increase in infrastructure as well as without venturing into the highly competitive retail specialty coffee environment.&#160;&#160;We believe that by utilizing our current strategy we can be as profitable or more profitable than our competitors in this segment by selling &#8220;one bag at a time&#8221; rather than &#8220;one cup at a time.&#8221;

&#160;&#160;We roast
 blend
 package and sell coffee under private labels for companies throughout the United States and Canada.&#160;&#160;Our private label coffee is sold in cans
 brick packages and instants in a variety of sizes.&#160;&#160;As of October 31
 2015
We produce private label coffee for customers who desire to sell coffee under their own name but do not want to engage in the manufacturing process.&#160;&#160;Our private label customers seek a quality similar to the national brands at a lower cost
 which represents a better value for the consumer.

&#160;&#160;We roast and blend our branded coffee according to our own recipes and package the coffee at our facilities in La Junta
 Colorado and Brecksville
 Ohio.&#160;&#160;We then sell the packaged coffee under our brand labels to supermarkets
 wholesalers and individually-owned stores throughout the United States.

We hold trademarks for each of our proprietary name brands and have the exclusive right to use the S&amp;W
 IL CLASSICO brand names in the United States in connection with the production
 manufacture and sale of roasted whole bean and ground coffee for distribution at the retail level.&#160;&#160;For further information regarding our trademark rights

We also offer several niche products
 including:






















































Coffee is a commodity traded on the Commodities and Futures Exchange subject to price fluctuations.&#160;&#160;Over the past five years
 the average price per pound of coffee beans ranged from approximately $1.03 to $3.05.&#160;&#160;The price for coffee beans on the commodities market as of October&#160;31
 2015 and 2014 was $1.21and $1.88 per pound
 respectively.&#160;&#160;Specialty green coffee
 unlike most coffee
 is not tied directly to the commodities cash markets.&#160;&#160;Instead
 it tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium over commodity coffee pricing
 depending on the origin
 supply and demand at the time of purchase.&#160;&#160;We are a licensed Fair Trade dealer for Fair Trade certified coffee.&#160;&#160;Fair Trade certified coffee helps small coffee farmers to increase their incomes and improve the prospects of their communities and families by guaranteeing farmers a minimum price of ten cents above the current market price.&#160;&#160;Our Ohio Facility operated by Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&#8220;GCC&#8221;) is certified organic by the Organic Crop Improvement Association (OCIA).&#160;&#160;All of our specialty green coffees
 as well as all of the other coffees we import for roasting
 are subject to multiple levels of quality control.

We purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the United States.&#160;&#160;The dealers supply us with coffee beans from many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
 Brazil and Uganda.&#160;&#160;For the fiscal years ended 2015 and 2014
 approximately 64% and 60% of all of our green coffee purchases were from five suppliers.&#160;&#160;One of these suppliers
 Rothfos Corporation
 accounted for approximately $22.1 million
 or 21%
 in 2015
 and $17.5 million
 or 19%
 in 2014
 of our total product purchases.&#160;&#160;An employee of Rothfos Corporation is one of our directors.&#160;&#160;We do not have any formalized
 material agreements or long-term contracts with any of these suppliers.&#160;&#160;Rather
 our purchases are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders.&#160;&#160;We do not believe that the loss of any one supplier
 including Rothfos
 would have a material adverse effect on our operations due to the availability of alternate suppliers.

The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#160;&#160;Supply and price can be affected by factors such as weather
 politics and economics within the countries that export coffee.&#160;&#160;Increases in the cost of coffee beans can
 to a certain extent
 be passed on to our customers in the form of higher prices for coffee beans and processed coffee.&#160;&#160;Drastic or prolonged increases in coffee prices may also adversely impact our business as it could lead to a decline in overall consumption of coffee.&#160;&#160;Similarly
 rapid decreases in the cost of coffee beans may force us to lower our sale prices before realizing cost reductions in our purchases.

















We subject all of our private unroasted green coffee to both a pre-shipment sample approval and an additional sample approval upon arrival into the United States.&#160;&#160;Once the arrival sample is approved
 we then bring the coffee to one of our facilities to roast and blend according to our own strict specifications.&#160;&#160;During the roasting and blending process
 samples are pulled off the production line and tested on an hourly basis to ensure that each batch roasted is consistent with the others and meets the strict quality standards demanded by our customers and us.



The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#160;&#160;Historically
 we have used
 and intend to continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our costs of sales
.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we acquired
 and expect to continue to acquire
 futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months

 in normal economic times
 our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales
&#160;However


 we have incurred significant losses on options and futures contracts during some recent reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or increase our losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease our profitability and adversely affect our stock price.&#160;&#160;See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors - If our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs

 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increased losses.&#160;&#160;As previously announced
 as a result of the volatile nature of the commodities markets
 we have and are continuing to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading of coffee futures and options contracts
 and intend to continue to use these practices in a limited capacity going forward.&#160;&#160;See &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8212;Commodity Price Risks.&#8221;



We hold trademarks
 registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office
 for all seven of our proprietary coffee brands and an exclusive license for S&amp;W
 IL CLASSICO brands for sale in the United States.&#160;&#160;Trademark registrations are subject to periodic renewal and we anticipate maintaining our registrations.&#160;&#160;We believe that our brands are recognizable in the marketplace and that brand recognition is important to the success of our branded coffee business.



We sell wholesale green coffee to GMCR.&#160;&#160;Sales to GMCR accounted for approximately $63.8 million or 54% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015
 and $62 million or 60% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.

Although our agreements with wholesale customers generally contain only pricing terms
 our contracts with certain customers also contain minimum and maximum purchase obligations at fixed prices.&#160;&#160;Because our profits on a fixed-price contract could decline if coffee prices increased
 we acquire futures contracts with longer terms (generally three to four months) primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices.&#160;&#160;Although the use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks or increased losses and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contacts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts. See &#8220;Our Use of Derivatives.&#8221;


















We market our private label and wholesale coffee through trade shows
 industry publications
 face-to-face contact and through the use of our internal sales force and non-exclusive independent food and beverage sales brokers.&#160;&#160;We also use our web site (www.coffeeholding.com) as a method of marketing our coffee products and ourselves.

For our private label and branded coffees
 we will
 from time to time in conjunction with retailers and with wholesalers
 conduct in-store promotions
 such as product demonstrations
 coupons
 price reductions
 two-for-one sales and new product launches to capture changing consumer taste preferences for upscale canned coffees.

















We evaluate opportunities for growth consistent with our business objectives.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we have established relationships with independent sales brokers to market our products across the United States
 in areas of the country where we have not had a high penetration of sales and Canada.&#160;&#160;We utilize our in-house sales personnel to market our private label brands.&#160;&#160;We intend to capture additional market share in our existing distribution channels by selectively adding or introducing new brand names and products across multiple price points
 including niche specialty blends
 private label &#8220;value&#8221; blends and tea and our own brands
 filter packages
 and peripheral products.



We are also a supporter of several coffee-oriented charitable organizations and during fiscal 2015 and 2014
 we donated approximately $67
000 and $41
000
 respectively
 to charities.











For over 20 years
 we have been members of Coffee Kids
 an international non-profit organization that helps to improve the quality of life of children and their families in coffee-growing communities in Mexico
 Guatemala
 Nicaragua and Costa Rica.














We are members of Grounds for Health
 an organization that educates
 screens
 and arranges treatment for women who have cancer and live in the rural coffee growing communities of Mexico.





























We are the administrative benefactors to a non-profit organization called Cup for Education.&#160;&#160;After discovering the lack of schools
 teachers
 and basic fundamental learning supplies in the poor coffee growing communities of Central and Latin America
 &#8220;Cup&#8221; was established by our employee
 Karen Gordon
 to help build schools
 sponsor teachers
 and purchase basic supplies such as books
 chalk and other necessities for a proper education.








&#160;&#160;There are many green coffee dealers throughout the United States.&#160;&#160;Many of these dealers have greater financial resources than we do.&#160;&#160;However
 we believe that we have both the knowledge and the capability to assist small specialty gourmet coffee roasters with developing and growing their businesses.&#160;&#160;Our over 40 years of experience as a roaster and a dealer of green coffee allows us to provide our roasting experience as a value added service to our gourmet roaster customers.&#160;&#160;While other coffee merchants may be able to offer lower prices for coffee beans
 we market ourselves as a value-added supplier to small roasters
 with the ability to help them market their specialty coffee products and develop a customer base.&#160;&#160;The assistance we provide our customers includes training
 coffee blending and market identification.&#160;&#160;Because specialty green coffee beans are sold unroasted to small coffee shops and roasters that market their products to local gourmet customers
 we do not believe that our specialty green coffee customers compete with our private label or branded coffee lines of business.&#160;&#160;We believe that the addition of Organic Products Trading Company
 LLC (&#8220;OPTCO&#8221;) as well as our two green coffee salespersons in South Carolina and Oregon allows us to compete more effectively throughout the country.

&#160;&#160;There are several major producers of coffee for private label sales in the United States.&#160;&#160;Many other companies produce coffee for sale on a regional basis.&#160;&#160;Our main competitor is the former retail coffee division of Sara Lee Corporation
 which was purchased by Segafredo Zanetti Group in 2006
 now known as Massimo Zanetti Beverage.&#160;&#160;Massimo Zanetti Beverage is larger and has more financial and other resources than we do and
 therefore
 is able to devote more resources to product development and marketing.&#160;&#160;We believe that we remain competitive by providing a higher level of quality and customer service.&#160;&#160;This service includes ensuring that the coffee produced for each label maintains a consistent taste and is delivered on time and in the proper quantities.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we provide our private label customers with information on the coffee market on a regular basis.

&#160;&#160;Our proprietary brand coffees compete with many other brands that are sold in supermarkets and specialty stores
 primarily in the Northeastern United States.&#160;&#160;The branded coffee market in both the Northeast and elsewhere is dominated by three large companies:&#160;&#160;Kraft General Foods
 Inc. (owner of the Maxwell House brand)
 Smuckers (owner of the Folgers Caf&#233; Bustelo brands) and Massimo Zanetti Beverage which also markets specialty coffee in addition to non-specialty coffee.&#160;&#160;Our large competitors have greater access to capital and a greater ability to conduct marketing and promotions.&#160;&#160;We believe that
 while our competitors&#8217; brands may be more nationally recognizable
 our Caf&#233; Caribe brand is competitive in the fast growing Hispanic demographic and our S&amp;W brand has been a popular and recognizable brand on the west coast for over 80 years.&#160;&#160;



















Our coffee roasting operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations
 which require us to obtain licenses relating to customs
 health and safety
 building and land use and environmental protection.&#160;&#160;Our roasting facility is subject to state and local air-quality and emissions regulation.&#160;&#160;If we encounter difficulties in obtaining any necessary licenses or if we have difficulty complying with these laws and regulations
 then we could be subject to fines and penalties
 which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.&#160;&#160;In addition
 our product offerings could be limited
 thereby reducing our revenues.





We have 69&#160;full-time employees.&#160;&#160;None of our employees are represented by unions or collective bargaining agreements.&#160;&#160;Our management believes that we maintain good working relationships with our employees.&#160;&#160;To supplement our internal sales staff
 we sometimes engage independent national and regional sales brokers as independent contractors who work on a commission basis.













An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business.&#160;&#160;Before making an investment decision
 you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report.&#160;&#160;In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below
 other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.&#160;&#160;The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks
 and you could lose all of your investment.



Because our business is highly dependent upon a single commodity
 coffee
 any decrease in demand for coffee could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability.











the roasting
 blending
 packaging and distribution of private label coffee;














the roasting
 blending
 packaging and distribution of proprietary branded coffee; and












































































the type
 number and location of competing products.




Because we rely on a single commodity
 any decrease in demand for coffee would harm our business more than if we had more diversified product offerings and could materially adversely affect our revenues and operating results.
















If we are unable to geographically expand our branded and private label products

 among other things
 geographic expansion of our branded and private label products as opportunities arise.&#160;&#160;We may not be able to implement successfully this portion of our business strategy.&#160;&#160;Our ability to implement this portion of our business strategy is dependent on our ability to:





























































Our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully expand the geographic distribution of our branded and private label products.&#160;&#160;In addition
 our expenses could increase and our profits could decrease as we implement our growth strategy.

If our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs

 we have acquired and expect to continue to acquire to a lesser extent futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee.&#160;&#160;Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of sales.&#160;&#160;Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase our cost of sales.&#160;&#160;

The use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices. However
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts.&#160;&#160;Historically
 we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers
 thereby maintaining our gross profits
 however
 we may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers in the future.&#160;&#160;Failure to properly design and implement an effective hedging strategy may materially adversely affect our business and operating results.&#160;&#160;If the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedging results in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or an increase in losses.&#160;&#160;Although we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred losses on options and futures contracts during some reporting periods.&#160;&#160;In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or an increase in losses.&#160;&#160;Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease our profitability or increase losses and adversely affect our stock price.

&#160;&#160;In April 2006
 we entered into a joint venture with Caruso&#8217;s Coffee
 Inc. of Brecksville
 Ohio and formed GCC
 which engages in the roasting
 packaging and sale of private label specialty coffee products.&#160;&#160;We will continue to seek opportunities for new joint ventures.&#160;&#160;While we believe that our joint ventures will be successful
 losses in our joint ventures or any future joint ventures would hurt our profitability. In addition
 we generally will not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding our joint ventures.&#160; Investments in joint ventures may under certain circumstances
 involve risks not present when a third party is not involved
 including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of the required capital contributions.&#160; Joint venture partners may have business interests
 strategies or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests
 strategies or goals and may be
 in cases where we have a minority interest
 in a position to take actions contrary to our policies
 strategies or objectives.&#160;&#160;Any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and could prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort exclusively on our business strategies.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party joint venture partners.

















Any inability to successfully implement our strategy of growth through selective acquisitions
 licensing arrangements and other strategic alliances
 including joint ventures

 the selective acquisition or licensing of additional coffee brands and other strategic alliances including joint ventures
 presents risks that could result in increased expenditures and could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability
 including:











such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or other strategic alliances may divert our management&#8217;s attention from our existing operations;





























we may not be able to manage the contingent risks associated with the past operations of
 and other unanticipated problems arising in
 any acquired coffee company; and














we may not be able to control unanticipated costs associated with such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances.




In addition
 any such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances may result in:





























































As has been our practice in the past
 we will continuously evaluate any such acquisitions
 licensing opportunities or strategic alliances as they arise.&#160;&#160;However
 we have not reached any new agreements or arrangements with respect to any such acquisition
 licensing opportunity or strategic alliance (other than those described herein) at this time and we may not be able to consummate any acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances on terms favorable to us or at all.&#160;&#160;The failure to consummate any such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances may reduce our growth and expansion.&#160;&#160;In addition
 if these acquisitions
 licensing opportunities or strategic alliances are not successful
 our earnings could be materially adversely affected by increased expenses and decreased revenues.


The loss of any of our key customers
 including Keurig Green Mountain

 including GMCR
 which accounted for approximately 54% and 60% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively
 which decrease may continue in the future.&#160; GMCR has announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with JAB Holding Company (&#8220;JAB&#8221;) pursuant to which JAB will acquire GMCR and it is unclear what impact
 if any
 this potential acquisition will have on our customer relationship with GMCR. Although no other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our net sales during this period
 other customers may account for more than 10% of our net sales in future periods.&#160; We generally do not have long-term contracts with these or any of our customers.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty and are free to purchase products from our competitors.&#160;&#160;The loss of
 or reduction in sales to
 customers such as GMCR or any of our other customers to which we sell a significant amount of our products or any material adverse change in the financial condition of such customers would negatively affect our revenues and decrease our earnings.&#160;


If we lose our key personnel
 including Andrew Gordon and David Gordon

 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President &#8211; Operations and Secretary.&#160;&#160;We also depend to a large degree on the expertise of our coffee roasters.&#160;&#160;We do not have employment contracts with our coffee roasters.&#160;&#160;Our ability to source and purchase a sufficient supply of high quality coffee beans and to roast coffee beans consistent with our quality standards could suffer if we lose the services of any of these individuals.&#160;&#160;As a result
 our business and operating results would be adversely affected.&#160;&#160;We may not be successful in obtaining and retaining a replacement for either Andrew Gordon or David Gordon if they elect to stop working for us.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we do not have key-person insurance on the lives of Andrew Gordon or David Gordon.
















From time to time
 we utilize borrowings under our credit facility in connection with operations. Outstanding debt could have important negative consequences to the holders of our securities
 including the following:













































































Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our future operating performance is subject to market conditions and business factors that are beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt
 we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures
 sell assets
 seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt.

If our planned increase in marketing expenditures fails to promote and enhance our brands

 which we expect will create and maintain brand loyalty.&#160;&#160;If our brand-building strategy is unsuccessful
 these expenses may never be recovered
 and we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands or protect the value of our brands.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to achieve these goals
 our revenues and ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected.

Our success in promoting and enhancing our brands will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high quality products and service.&#160;&#160;Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted coffee
 we have no control over our roasted coffee products once they are purchased by our customers.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 wholesale customers may store our coffee for longer periods of time or resell our coffee without our consent
 in each case
 potentially affecting the quality of the coffee prepared from our products.&#160;&#160;Although we believe we are less susceptible to quality control problems than many of our competitors because our products are processed in-house under strict quality control guidelines which have been in place for more than 30 years
 if consumers do not perceive our products and service to be of high quality
 then the value of our brands may be diminished and
 consequently
 our operating results and ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected.

Our roasting methods are not proprietary
 so competitors may be able to duplicate them
 which could harm our competitive position.&#160;&#160;If our competitive position is weakened

 therefore
 essential to our brands of coffee.&#160;&#160;Because we do not hold any patents for our roasting methods
 it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known.&#160;&#160;If our competitors copy our roasting methods
 the value of our coffee brands may be diminished
 and we may lose customers to our competitors.&#160;&#160;In addition
 competitors may be able to develop roasting methods that are more advanced than our roasting methods
 which may also harm our competitive position.

The success of our brand also depends in part on our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trademarks
 copyrights
 service marks
 trade secrets and similar rights to protect our intellectual property. The success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand in both domestic and international markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate
 or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property
 the value of our brand may be harmed
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may become engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property
 which could result in substantial costs to us as well as diversion of management attention.

Since we rely heavily on common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis
 any disruption in their services or increase in shipping costs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers
 which could result in reduced revenues
 increased operating expenses

 contract disputes and other factors.&#160;&#160;If we experience an interruption in these services
 we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner
 which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship with our customers.&#160;&#160;In addition
 a delay in shipping could require us to contract with alternative
 and possibly more expensive
 common carriers and could cause orders to be cancelled or receipt of goods to be refused.&#160;&#160;Any significant increase in shipping costs could lower our profit margins or force us to raise prices
 which could cause our revenue and profits to suffer.

















If there was a significant interruption in the operation of our Colorado facility
 we may not have the capacity to service all of our customers and we may not be able to service our customers in a timely manner

 natural disaster
 power loss
 telecommunications failure or similar events. In addition
 growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the capacity of our systems and lead to degradations in performance or systems failure. Although we continually review and consider upgrades to our order fulfillment infrastructure and provide for system redundancies to limit the likelihood of systems overload or failure
 substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure that causes interruptions for a number of days could adversely affect our business. Additionally
 if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our order fulfillment infrastructure
 our ability to grow may be constrained.&#160;&#160;As a result
 our revenues and earnings could be materially adversely affected.

Prolonged negative economic conditions could adversely affect us
 our customers and suppliers

 difficulties in the financial services sector
 diminished liquidity and availability of credit
 concerns regarding inflation
 increases in the costs of commodities
 continuing high unemployment rates
 reduced consumer spending and consumer confidence and continuing economic uncertainties.&#160;&#160;If the United States economy were to deteriorate significantly
 our business could be negatively impacted.

If we fail to continue to develop and maintain our brand

 we may never recover the expenses incurred in connection with these efforts and we may be unable to increase our future revenue or implement our business strategy.&#160;&#160;Our success in promoting and enhancing our brand will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high-quality products and customer service.&#160; Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted coffee
 we have no control over our coffee products once purchased by customers.&#160; Accordingly
 customers may prepare coffee from our brands inconsistent with our standards
 store our coffee for long periods of time or resell our coffee without our consent
 which in each case
 potentially affects the quality of the coffee prepared from our products.&#160; If customers do not perceive our products and service to be of high-quality
 then the value of our brand may be diminished and
 consequently
 our ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected.




&#160;&#160;Green coffee is our largest single cost of sales.&#160;&#160;Coffee is a traded commodity and
 in general
 its price can fluctuate depending on:



















economic and political conditions affecting coffee-producing countries
 including acts of terrorism in such countries;






























If the cost of wholesale green coffee increases due to any of these factors
 our margins could decrease and our profitability could suffer accordingly.&#160;&#160;It is expected that coffee prices will remain volatile in the coming years.&#160;&#160;Although we have historically attempted to raise the selling prices of our products in response to increases in the price of wholesale green coffee
 when wholesale green coffee prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels
 we are not always able to pass the price increases through to our customers on a timely basis
 if at all
 which adversely affects our operating margins and cash flow.&#160;&#160;We may not be able to recover any future increases in the cost of wholesale green coffee.&#160;&#160;Even if we are able to recover future increases
 our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation of price increases.

Disruptions in the supply of green coffee could result in a deterioration of our relationship with our customers

 pest damage
 economic conditions
 acts of terrorism
 as well as efforts by coffee growers to expand or form cartels or associations.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the political situation in many of the Arabica coffee growing regions
 including Africa
 Indonesia
 and Central and South America
 can be unstable
 and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions. If Arabica coffee beans from a region become unavailable or prohibitively expensive
 we could be forced to discontinue particular coffee types and blends or substitute coffee beans from other regions in our blends. Frequent substitutions and changes in our coffee product lines could lead to cost increases
 customer alienation and fluctuations in our gross margins.
















Some of the Arabica coffee beans of the quality we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets.&#160;&#160;Rather
 we purchase the high-end Arabica coffee beans that we use on a negotiated basis.&#160;&#160;We depend on our relationships with coffee brokers
 exporters and growers for the supply of our primary raw material
 high quality Arabica coffee beans.&#160;&#160;If any of our relationships with coffee brokers
 exporters or growers deteriorate
 we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high quality coffee beans at prices acceptable to us or at all.&#160;&#160;In such case
 we may not be able to fulfill the demand of our existing customers
 supply new retail stores or expand other channels of distribution.&#160;&#160;A raw material shortage could result in a deterioration of our relationship with our customers
 decreased revenues or could impair our ability to expand our business.

The coffee industry is highly competitive and if we cannot compete successfully
&#160;&#160;The coffee markets in which we do business are highly competitive and competition in these markets could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low barriers of entry.&#160;&#160;The industry in which we compete is particularly sensitive to price pressure
 as well as quality
 reputation and viability for wholesale and brand loyalty for retail.&#160;&#160;To the extent that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key competitive factor
 our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected.&#160;&#160;Our private label and branded coffee products compete with other manufacturers of private label coffee and branded coffees.&#160;&#160;These competitors
 such as Kraft General Foods
 Inc. (owner of the Maxwell House brand)
&#160;&#160;Smuckers (owner of the Folgers Caf&#233; Bustelo brands)
 and Massimo Zanetti Beverage
 have much greater financial
 marketing
 distribution
 management and other resources than we do for marketing
 promotions and geographic and market expansion.&#160;&#160;In addition
 there are a growing number of specialty coffee companies who provide specialty green coffee and roasted coffee for retail sale.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and new competitors
 we may lose our customers or experience reduced sales and profitability.

Besides coffee
 we face exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations

 we are exposed to cost fluctuation in other commodities
 including
 in particular
 steel
 natural gas and gasoline.&#160; In addition
 an increase in the cost of fuel could indirectly lead to higher electricity costs
 transportation costs and other commodity costs. Much like coffee costs
 the costs of these commodities depend on various factors beyond our control
 including economic and political conditions
 foreign currency fluctuations
 and global weather patterns. To the extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers through price increases
 our margins and profitability will decrease.

Coffee contains caffeine and other active compounds
 the health effects of some of which are not fully understood.&#160; A number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate
 nausea and vomiting
 restlessness and anxiety
 depression
 headaches
 tremors
 sleeplessness and other adverse health effects.&#160; An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in coffee could significantly reduce the demand for coffee
 which could harm our business and reduce our sales and profits. In addition
 we could become subject to litigation relating to the existence of such compounds in our coffee; litigation that could be costly and could divert management attention.





Our operating results may fluctuate significantly

 many of which are outside of our control.&#160;&#160;These fluctuations could be caused by a number of factors including:











































































































As a result of the foregoing
 period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and those comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 our operating results in future quarters may be below market expectations.&#160;&#160;In this event
 the price of our common stock may decline.

Members of the Gordon family
 including Andrew Gordon
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President and Secretary
 own
 in the aggregate
 approximately 9.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result
 the Gordon family is able to influence the actions that require stockholder approval
 including:









































the approval of mergers
 sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval.




As a result
 our other stockholders may have reduced influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. In addition
 the Gordon family&#8217;s influence could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and consequently materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.


&#160;&#160;The market price and trading volume of our common stock has been volatile over the past year and it may continue to be volatile. Over the past year
 our common stock has traded as low as $3.74 and as high as $6.20 per share.&#160;&#160;We cannot predict the price at which our common stock will trade in the future and it may decline. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly and may be influenced by many factors
 including our financial results
 developments generally affecting the coffee industry
 general economic
 industry and market conditions
 the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock
 fluctuations in coffee prices
 investor perceptions of our business
 reports by industry analysts
 negative announcements by our customers
 competitors or suppliers regarding their own performances
 and the impact of other &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; discussed in this Annual Report.

Provisions in our articles of incorporation
 bylaws and of Nevada law have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control that could be beneficial to our stockholders

 bylaws and Nevada corporate law contain provisions that could delay
 defer or prevent a change in control of us or our management that could be beneficial to our stockholders.&#160;&#160;These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.&#160;&#160;These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer
 even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a price above the then current market price for shares of our common stock.&#160;&#160;These provisions:
























































authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares
 which would be senior to our common stock
 without prior stockholder approval;





























a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms
 which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; and














provide a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent
 thereby only permitting stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders.



















We are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Nevada law.&#160;&#160;Under Nevada law
 a corporation may not
 in general
 engage in a business combination with any &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; which includes
 among other things
 a holder of 10% or more of its common stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or
 among other things
 the board of directors has approved the transaction.



























We are headquartered at 3475 Victory Boulevard
 Staten Island
 New York
 where we lease office and warehouse space.&#160;&#160;We pay annual rent of $129
420 under the terms of the lease
 which expires on October 31
 2023.

We lease a 50
000 square foot facility located at 27700 Frontage Road in La Junta
 Colorado from the City of La Junta.&#160;&#160;We pay annual rent of $100
093 under the terms of the lease
 which expires in January 2024.


We lease office space in Vancouver
 Washington.&#160;&#160;We pay annual rent of $36
889 under the terms of a lease
 which expires in May 2017.

We also use a variety of independent
 bonded commercial warehouses to store our green coffee beans.&#160;&#160;Our management believes that our facilities are adequate for our current operations and for our contemplated operations in the foreseeable future.













We are not a party to
 and none of our property is the subject of
 any pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation that is incidental to our business.&#160;&#160;To our knowledge
 no governmental authority is contemplating initiating any such proceedings.

Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#8220;JVA.&#8221;&#160;We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock. We do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future
 but currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. The payment of cash dividends if any

 among other things
 upon our earnings

 we undertake no responsibility to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances
 that occur after the date of this annual report.



















We are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the United States and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes
 preferences and price points.&#160;&#160;As a result
 we believe that we are well-positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles of the coffee market and economic conditions.




























the roasting
 blending
 packaging and sale of private label coffee; and














the roasting
 blending
 packaging and sale of our seven brands of coffee.

















































































Our net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.&#160;&#160;For this reason
 we have made
 and will continue to evaluate
 strategic decisions to invest in measures that are expected to increase net sales.&#160;&#160;These transactions include our acquisition of Premier Roasters
 LLC
 including equipment and a roasting facility in La Junta
 Colorado
 the addition of a west coast sales manager to increase sales of our private label and branded coffees to new customers
 our joint venture with Caruso&#8217;s Coffee
 Inc. of Brecksville
 Ohio
 the transaction with OPTCO and our licensing agreement with DTS8 Coffee Company
 Ltd.&#160;&#160;We believe these efforts will allow us to expand or business.


Our net sales are affected by the price of green coffee.&#160;&#160;We purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the United States.&#160;&#160;The dealers supply us with coffee beans from many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
 Brazil and Uganda.&#160;&#160;The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#160;&#160;For example
 in Brazil
 which produces approximately 40% of the world&#8217;s green coffee
 the coffee crops are historically susceptible to frost in June and July and drought in September
 October and November.&#160;&#160;However
 because we purchase coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one country&#8217;s coffee for another in our products
 price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations
 liquidity and capital resources.&#160;&#160;Historically
 because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers
 increased prices of green coffee generally result in increased net sales.

The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#160;&#160;Historically
 we have used
 and intend to continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices
.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we acquired
 and expect to continue to acquire
 futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months

 in normal economic times
 our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales
&#160;However


 we have incurred significant losses on options and futures contracts during some recent reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or increase our losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease our profitability and adversely affect our stock price.&#160;&#160;See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors - If our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs

 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increased losses.&#160;&#160;As previously announced
 as a result of the volatile nature of the commodities markets
 we have and are continuing to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading of coffee futures and options contracts
 and intend to continue to use these practices in a limited capacity going forward.


















The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.&#160;&#160;Estimates are used for
 but not limited to
 the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventories
 assets held for sale
 income taxes
 commodities held and loss contingencies.&#160;&#160;Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.&#160;&#160;Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies
 among others
 may be impacted significantly by judgment
 assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements:











We recognize revenue in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance.&#160;&#160;Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers which is upon the shippers taking possession of the goods because i) title passes in accordance with the terms of the purchase orders and with our agreements with our customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered by the customers&#8217; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is determinable and v) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.&#160;&#160;Thus
 revenue is recognized at the point of shipment.














Our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers&#8217; inability to make required payments.&#160;&#160;If there is deterioration of our customers&#8217; credit worthiness and/or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used
 additional allowances may be required.&#160;&#160;For example
 every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible
 would decrease our operating income by approximately $110
000 for the year ended October 31
 2015.&#160;&#160;The reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated discount that customers will take upon payment.&#160;&#160;The reserve for other allowances represents the estimated amount of returns
 slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by us from our customers.














Inventories are stated at lower of cost (determined on a first-in
 first-out basis) or market.&#160;&#160;Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions
 inventories are subject to be written-down to market value.&#160;&#160;If our assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
 additional write-downs of inventories may be required.&#160;&#160;Each additional one percent of potential inventory writedown would have decreased operating income by approximately $139
000 for the year ended October 31
 2015.















The commodities held at broker represent the market value of the Company&#8217;s trading account
 which consists of option and futures contracts for coffee held with a brokerage firm. We use options and futures contracts
 which are not designated or qualifying as hedging instruments
 to partially hedge the effects of fluctuations in the price of green coffee beans. Options and futures contracts are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements with current recognition of gains and losses on such positions. We classify options and futures contracts as trading securities and accordingly
 unrealized holding gains and losses are included in earnings. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses in our cost of sales in the statement of operations/income.














We account for income taxes in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance.&#160;&#160;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.&#160;&#160;Deferred tax assets are reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 our net deferred tax asset as of October 31
 2015 of $905
350 may require a valuation allowance if we do not generate taxable income.





























Our goodwill consists of the cost in excess of the fair market value of the acquired net assets of OPTCO
 which&#160;&#160;has been integrated into a structure that does not provide the basis for separate reporting units. Consequently
 we are a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. We also have intangible assets consisting of our customer list and relationships and trademarks acquired from OPTCO. At October 31
 2015 our balance sheet reflected goodwill and intangible assets as set forth below:











October 31
 2015




Customer list and relationships
 net






108
750









180
000









440
000















728
750











Goodwill and the trademarks which are deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill impairment tests require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Upon completion of such review
 if impairment is found to have occurred
 a corresponding charge will be recorded. The value assigned to the customer list and relationships is being amortized over a twenty year period.

Because the Company is a single reporting unit
 the closing NASDAQ Capital Market price of our common stock as of the acquisition date was used as a basis to measure the fair value of goodwill. Goodwill and the intangible assets will be tested annually at the end of each fiscal year to determine whether they have been impaired. Upon completion of each annual review
 there can be no assurance that a material charge will not be recorded. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment or decline in value may have occurred.

Year Ended October 31
 2015 (Fiscal Year 2015) Compared to the Year Ended October 31
 2014 (Fiscal Year 2014)

&#160;&#160;Net sales totaled $118
153
541 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015
 an increase of $9
290
444
 or 8.53%
 from $108
863
097 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;The increase in net sales reflects a combination of increased sales of green and roasted coffee.


&#160;&#160;Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 was $112
436
831
 or 95.2% of net sales
 as compared to $93
334
118
 or 85.7% of net sales
 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity.&#160;&#160;The increase in cost of sales reflects approximately $5.5 million net loss
 due to losses substantially incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 resulting from the liquidation of many of our previously entered hedging positions as we implemented our plan to scale back our use of hedging and short term trading of coffee futures and options contracts.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;Gross profit for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 was $5
716
710
 a decrease of $9
812
269 from $15
528
979 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 4.8% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 from 14.3% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;The decrease in our margins reflects net losses substantially incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 resulting from the liquidation of many of our previously entered hedging positions as we implemented our plan to scale back our use of hedging and short term trading of coffee futures and options contracts and a decrease in commodity pricing period over period.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;Total operating expenses increased by $126
577 to $7
654
029 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 from $7
527
452 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Selling and administrative expenses increased $132
692
 or 1.9%
 to $7
000
744 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 from $6
868
052 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Officers&#8217; salary decreased by $6
115 or 1% to $653
285 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 from $659
400 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.
















&#160;&#160;Other expense for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 was $155
858
 an increase of $119
553 from $36
305 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;The increase in other expense was attributable to an increase in interest expense of $119
581 and an increase in our loss from our equity investments
 partially offset by an increase in interest and other income during the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015.

&#160;&#160;We had a loss of $(2
093
177) before income taxes and non-controlling interest in subsidiary for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 compared to income of $7
965
222 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014
 resulting in a net change of $10
058
399 for the year ended October 31
 2015.&#160;&#160;The decrease was primarily attributable to our decreased realized trading gains.


&#160;&#160;Our (benefit) provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 totaled $(763
647) compared to a provision of $2
947
102 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;The change was attributable to the difference in the loss for the year ended October 31
 2015 versus the gain in the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for the year ended October 31
 2015 was (37%) compared to 37% for the year ended October 31
 2014.


&#160;&#160;We had a net loss of $(1
413
228) or $(0.23) per share basic and diluted
 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 compared to net income of $4
967
535
 or $0.78 per share basic and diluted for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014. The decrease in net income was due primarily to the reasons described above.




As of October 31
 2015
 we had working capital of $21
934
477
 which represented a $1
542
325 decrease from our working capital of $23
476
802 as of October 31
 2014
 and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $24
081
793 which decreased by $1
640
074 from our total stockholders&#8217; equity of $25
721
871 as of October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Our working capital decreased primarily due to&#160;decreases of $4
451
623 in accounts receivable
 $1
347
335 in inventory and $3
910 in prepaid expenses and other current assets and an increase in our line of credit of $3
055
663
&#160;&#160;partially offset by increases of $71
177 in cash
 $153
297 in prepaid green coffee
 $1
433
818&#160;&#160;in prepaid and refundable income taxes
 $654
063 in deferred income tax asset
 decreases of $4
671
711 in accounts payable and accrued expenses
 $1
089 in due to broker and $331
051 income taxes payable.&#160;&#160;As of October 31
 2015
 the outstanding balance on our line of credit was $5
554
121 compared to $2
498
458 as of October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Total stockholders&#8217; equity decreased due to our net loss and by our Share Repurchase Program.

On March 10
 2015
 we entered into a loan modification agreement (the &#8220;Modification Agreement&#8221;) with our lender Sterling National Bank (&#8220;Sterling&#8221;) which modified the terms of the financing agreement with Sterling previously entered into on February 17
 2009 (the &#8220;Financing Agreement&#8221;). Prior to the Modification Agreement
 the Financing Agreement
 as amended
 provided for a credit facility in which we had a revolving line of credit for a maximum of $7
000
000 (the &#8220;Loan Facility&#8221;). On February 3
 2011
 we amended the Financing Agreement to create a create a sublimit within the revolving line of credit in the form of a $300
000 term loan for the benefit of GCC.&#160;&#160;The Financing Agreement was set to expire on March 31
 2015. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
 the Financing Agreement was modified to
 among other things
 (i) extend the term of the Financing Agreement until February 28
 2017; (ii) increase the maximum amount of the Loan Facility from $7
000
000 to $9
000
000; (iii) reduce the interest rate on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit from an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate of 3.75% to an interest rate per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate; and (iv) require us to pay
 upon the occurrence of certain termination events
 a prepayment premium of 0.50% of the maximum amount of the credit facility in effect as of the date of the termination event.

Other than as described above
 the Financing Agreement remains in full force and effect. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
 we are able to draw on the loan Facility up to an amount of 85% of eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible inventory consisting of green coffee beans and finished coffee not to exceed $1
000
000. The Loan Facility is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company.

The Loan Facility contains covenants that place annual restrictions on our operations
 including covenants related to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 minimum deposit restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 distribution restrictions (common stock and preferred stock)
 dividend restrictions
 and restrictive transactions. The Loan Facility also requires that we maintain a minimum working capital at all times.&#160;&#160;The Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants at October 31
 2015 and October 31
 2014.
















As of October 31
 2015 and 2014
 the outstanding balance under the bank line of credit was $4
317
121 and $2
498
458
 respectively.

Also on March 10
 2015
 we
 as guarantor
 and OPTCO (the &#8220;Borrower&#8221;)
 as borrower
 entered into a new loan facility agreement with Sterling.&#160;&#160;The new loan facility is a revolving line of credit for a maximum of $3
000
000 (the &#8220;New Loan Facility&#8221;)
 including a letter of credit in the amount of $286
855. The New Loan Facility terminates on February 28
 2017.&#160; The Borrower is able to draw on the New Loan Facility at an amount up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable
 not to exceed 25% of all accounts of the Borrower.&#160;&#160;The New Loan Facility is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate&#160;&#160;(currently 3.25%).&#160;The New Loan Facility is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company.&#160;&#160;In connection with the New Loan Facility
 the Company entered into a security agreement with Sterling and provided Sterling with a guarantee of the Borrower&#8217;s obligations.

As of October 31
 2015
 the outstanding balance under the New Loan Facility was $1
237
000 and the outstanding letter of credit amounted to $286
855.


For the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015
 our operating activities used net cash of $2
285
840 as compared to the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014 when operating activities provided net cash of $30
066.&#160;&#160;The decreased cash flow from operations for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 was primarily due to our net loss of $1
329
530
 $726
850 of deferred income taxes
 $153
297 of prepaid green coffee
 $1
433
818 of prepaid and refundable income taxes
 $4
671
711 of accounts payable and accrued expenses and $331
051of income taxes payable which was partially offset by increases of $4
451
623 in accounts receivable and $1
347
335 in inventory.

For the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015
 our investing activities used net cash of $391
796 as compared to the fiscal year October 31
 2014 when net cash used by investing activities was $504
644.&#160;&#160;The decrease in our uses of cash in investing activities was due to our reduced outlays for equipment during fiscal year 2015.

For the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015
 our financing activities provided net cash of $2
748
813 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $221
548 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;The change in cash flow from financing activities for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015 was due to our increased net borrowing of $1
786
386 and a decrease of $768
879 in our treasury stock purchases
 partially offset by a decrease in our dividend payment of $28
000.

We expect to fund our operations
 including paying our liabilities
 funding capital expenditures and making required payments on our indebtedness
 through October 31
 2016 with cash provided by operating activities and the use of our credit facility.&#160;&#160;In addition
 an increase in eligible accounts receivable and inventory would permit us to make additional borrowings under our line of credit.



We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
















We are subject to market risk from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.&#160;&#160;As of October 31
 2015
 our debt consisted of $5
554
121 of variable rate debt under our revolving line of credit.&#160;&#160;Our line of credit provides for a maximum of $9
000
000 and is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate (currently 3.25%). &#160;&#160;This loan is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company.

















&#160;The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#160;&#160;Historically
 we have used
 and intend to continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices
.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we acquired
 and expect to continue to acquire
 futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months

 in normal economic times
 our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales
&#160;However


 we have incurred significant losses on options and futures contracts during some recent reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or increase our losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease our profitability and adversely affect our stock price.&#160;&#160;See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors - If our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs

 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increased losses.&#160;&#160;As previously announced
 as a result of the volatile nature of the commodities markets
 we have and are continuing to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading of coffee futures and options contracts
 and intend to continue to use these practices in a limited capacity going forward.&#160;&#160;See &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8212;Commodity Price Risks.&#8221;

As of October 31
 2015
 we held 38 futures contracts for the purchase of 1
425
000 pounds of green coffee at a weighted average price of $1.23 per pound compared to 60 futures contracts for the purchase of 2
250
000 pounds of coffee at a weighted average price of $2.00 per pound for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;The fair market value of coffee applicable to such contracts was $1.21 and $1.88 per pound
 respectively.&#160;&#160;At October 31
 2015
 we also held 20 options covering an aggregate of 750
000 pounds of green coffee beans at $1.25 per pound.&#160;&#160;The fair market value of these options
 was $42
750 at October 31
 2015.










































Management
 which includes our President
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.&#160;&#160;Based upon that evaluation
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file and submit under the Exchange Act is (i)&#160;recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported as and when required and (ii)&#160;accumulated and communicated
 as is appropriate
 to our management
 including its principal executive officer and financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.



















Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets
 provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP
 and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and the directors
 and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160;&#160;Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 31
 2015.&#160;&#160;In making this assessment
 management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.&#160;&#160;Based on our assessment our management believes that
 as of October 31
 2015
 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected
 or that is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of October 31
 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the years then ended.&#160;&#160;These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management.&#160;&#160;Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&#160;&#160;Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.&#160;&#160;The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.&#160;&#160;Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.&#160;&#160;An audit also includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.&#160;&#160;We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. and Subsidiaries as of October 31
 2015 and 2014
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

COFFEE HOLDING CO.
 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

OCTOBER 31
 2015 AND 2014





Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) conducts wholesale coffee operations
 including manufacturing
 roasting
 packaging
 marketing and distributing roasted and blended coffees for private labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green coffee.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s core product
 coffee
 can be summarized and divided into three product categories (&#8220;product lines&#8221;) as follows:





 coffee roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and





The Company&#8217;s private label and branded coffee sales are primarily to customers that are located throughout the United States with limited sales in Canada and certain countries in Asia.&#160;&#160;Such customers include supermarkets
 wholesalers
 and individually-owned and multi-unit retailers.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is sold primarily to specialty gourmet roasters and to coffee shop operators in the United States with limited sales in Australia
 Canada
 England and China.

The Company&#8217;s wholesale green
 private label
 and branded coffee product categories generate revenues and cost of sales individually but incur selling
 general and administrative expenses in the aggregate. There are no individual product managers and discrete financial information is not available for any of the product lines. The Company&#8217;s product portfolio is used in one business and it operates and competes in one business activity and economic environment. In addition
 the three product lines share customers
 manufacturing resources
 sales channels
 and marketing support. Thus
 the Company considers the three product lines to be one single reporting segment.






The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
 Organic Products Trading Company
 LLC (&#8220;OPTCO&#8221;) and Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&#8220;GCC&#8221;).&#160;&#160;All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.





The preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.&#160;&#160;Significant estimates include allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and reserves
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 intangible asset valuations and useful lives
 taxes
 contingencies
 and valuation of financial instruments. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available
 and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts.

 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

OCTOBER 31
 2015 AND 2014










Prepaid coffee is an item that emanates from OPTCO.&#160;&#160;The balance represents advance payments made by OPTCO to several coffee growing cooperatives for the purchase of green coffee.&#160;&#160;Interest is charged to the cooperatives for these advances.&#160;&#160;Interest earned was $45
049 and $40
334 as of October 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.&#160;&#160;The prepaid coffee balance was $620
452 and $467
155 as of October 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.





Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current economic industry trends
 and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&#8217;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#8217;s assessment
 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.


The reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated discount that customers will take upon payment.&#160;&#160;The reserve for other allowances represents the estimated amount of returns
 slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by the Company from its customers.&#160;&#160;The allowances are summarized as follows:

The Company has determined that its goodwill and trademarks
 which consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have an indefinite useful life.&#160;&#160;The value of the goodwill and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation.&#160;&#160;Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized but are assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair value.&#160;&#160;As of October 31
 2015 and 2014
 the Company has determined by using a qualitative assessment that an impairment did not exist.&#160;&#160;In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other &#8211; Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.&#160;&#160;Under this amendment
 an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a qualitative assessment
 that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.










The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotion as incurred.&#160;&#160;Advertising costs charged to operations totaled $157

The carrying amounts of cash
 accounts receivable
 notes receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.&#160;&#160;The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities.&#160;&#160;Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available.&#160;&#160;These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
 cannot be determined with precision.&#160;&#160;Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.





The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance.&#160;&#160;Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers upon the Company&#8217;s shippers taking possession of the goods at the time of shipment because i) title passes in accordance with the terms of the Company&#8217;s purchase orders and with its agreements with its customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered by the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is determinable and v) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.&#160;&#160;Thus
 revenue is recognized at the point of shipment to its customers.


Returns: The Company does not accept returns for damaged goods on packaged coffee and usable green coffee
 as the customer takes possession of our product at the point of shipment.&#160;&#160;In the event a customer claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent on behalf of the customer
 may file a claim for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an agent on behalf of its customers
 but may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper keeps the damaged product.&#160;&#160;The Company will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the Company receives reimbursement or credit from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an accrual for returns for damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial.&#160;&#160;The Company estimates that
 based on historical trends
 that future returns for damaged goods should also be immaterial.


In the event that the Company ships an incorrect order or has returns for short dated product
 the Company will accept those two types of items back as returns. The amount for these two types of returns are estimated
 accrued and recognized at the date of sale. These amounts are included in the determination of net sales.



 


Sales discounts:&#160;&#160;The amount of sales discounts are estimated
 accrued and recognized at the date of the sale.&#160;&#160;These amounts are included in the determination of net sales.

Volume-based incentives: These incentives typically involve rebates or refunds of a specific amount of cash consideration that are redeemable only if the reseller completes a specified cumulative level of sales transactions.&#160;&#160;Under incentive programs of this nature
 the Company estimates and accrues the cost of the rebate when it is taken by the reseller.&#160;&#160;These amounts are included in the determination of net sales.


Cooperative advertising: Under these arrangements
 the Company will agree to reimburse the reseller for a portion of the costs incurred by the reseller to advertise and promote certain of the Company&#8217;s products.&#160;&#160;The Company estimates
 accrues and recognizes the cost of cooperative advertising programs in the period in which the advertising and promotional activity first takes place.&#160;&#160;The costs of these incentives are included in advertising expense.




Revenue earned from shipping and handling fees is reflected in net sales.&#160;&#160;Costs associated with shipping product to customers aggregating approximately $1
352
000 and $1
374
000 for the years ended October 31
 2015 and 2014

 is included in selling and administrative expenses.








Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to certain limits. At October 31
 2015 and 2014
 the Company had approximately $220
422 and $171
091 in excess of FDIC insured limits
 respectively.


The accounts at the brokerage firm contain cash and securities. Balances are insured up to $500
000
 with a limit of $100
000 for cash
 by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). At October 31
 2015 and 2014
 the Company had approximately $2

 respectively.







The Company has operating lease agreements for its corporate office and warehouses
 some of which contain provisions for future rent increases or periods in which rent payments are abated.&#160;&#160;Operating leases which provide for lease payments that vary materially from the straight-line basis are adjusted for financial accounting purposes to reflect rental income or expense on the straight-line basis in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB.&#160;&#160;The excess of straight-line rent over actual payments by the Company of $222
055 and $209
640 is included as deferred rent payable as of October 31

Investee companies that are not consolidated
 but over which the Company exercises significant influence
 are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.&#160;&#160;Whether or not the Company exercises significant influence with respect to an Investee depends on an evaluation of several factors including
 among others
 representation on the Investee company&#8217;s board of directors and ownership level
 which is generally a 20% to 50% interest in the voting securities of the Investee company.&#160;&#160;Under the equity method of accounting
 an Investee company&#8217;s accounts are not reflected within the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income; however
 the Company&#8217;s share of the earnings or losses of the Investee company is reflected in the caption &#8220;Loss from equity method investments&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s carrying value in an equity method Investee company is reflected in the caption &#8220;Equity method investments&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets.


The Company&#8217;s investment in a company that is accounted for on the equity method of accounting consist of the following: (1) 20% interest in Healthwise Gourmet Coffees
 LLC
 a distributor of low acidity coffees.&#160;&#160;The investments in this company amounted to $100

In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 (&#8220;ASU 2014-09&#8221;) &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers
&#8221; which requires an entity to recognize revenue representing the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.&#160;&#160;ASU 2014-09 is intended to establish principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from the entity&#8217;s contracts with customers.&#160;&#160;ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective.&#160;&#160;The original standard was effective for the Company on January 1
 2017
 however
 in April 2015
 the FASB proposed a one-year deferral of this standard with a new effective date for the Company of January 1
 2018.&#160;&#160;Early application is not permitted.&#160;&#160;The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.


In July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
 &#8220;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&#8221; which applies to inventory that is measured using first-in
 first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) or average cost.&#160;&#160;Under the updated guidance
 an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation.&#160;&#160;Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using last-in
 last-out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;).&#160;&#160;This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.&#160;&#160;The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

On March 10
 2015
 the Company entered into a loan modification agreement (the &#8220;Modification Agreement&#8221;) with its lender Sterling National Bank (&#8220;Sterling&#8221;) which modified the terms of the financing agreement with Sterling previously entered into on February 17
 2009 (the &#8220;Financing Agreement&#8221;). Prior to the Modification Agreement
 the Financing Agreement
 as amended
 provided for a credit facility in which we had a revolving line of credit for a maximum of $7
000
000 (the &#8220;Loan Facility&#8221;). On February 3
 2011
 the Company amended the Financing Agreement to create a create a sublimit within the revolving line of credit in the form of a $300
000 term loan for the benefit of GCC.&#160;&#160;The Financing Agreement was set to expire on March 31
 2015. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
 the Financing Agreement was modified to
 among other things
 (i) extend the term of the Financing Agreement until February 28
 2017; (ii) increase the maximum amount of the Loan Facility from $7
000
000 to $9
000
000; (iii) reduce the interest rate on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit from an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate of 3.75% to an interest rate per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate; and (iv) require the Company to pay
 upon the occurrence of certain termination events
 a prepayment premium of 0.50% of the maximum amount of the credit facility in effect as of the date of the termination event.


Other than as described above
 the Financing Agreement remains in full force and effect. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
 we are able to draw on the loan Facility up to an amount of 85% of eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible inventory consisting of green coffee beans and finished coffee not to exceed $1
000
000. The Loan Facility is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company.


The Loan Facility contains covenants that place annual restrictions on our operations
 including covenants related to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 minimum deposit restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 distribution restrictions (common stock and preferred stock)
 dividend restrictions
 and restrictive transactions. The Loan Facility also requires that the Company maintain a minimum working capital at all times.&#160;&#160;The Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants at&#160;October 31
 2015 and October 31
 2014.

A valuation allowance was not provided at October 31
 2015 or 2014.&#160;&#160;In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#160;&#160;The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.&#160;&#160;Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.&#160;&#160;Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.&#160;&#160;The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable
 however
 could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.


As of October 31

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
 not adjusted for transaction costs.&#160;&#160;The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3) as described below:





Level 2 Inputs &#8211; Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable
 either directly or indirectly;














The Company&#8217;s commodity securities are classified within Level 2 and include coffee futures and options contracts. To determine fair value
 the Company utilizes the market approach valuation technique for the coffee futures and options contracts.&#160;&#160;The Company uses Level 2 inputs that are based on market data of similar instruments that are in observable markets. All commodities on the balance sheet are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings.

 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at which&#13;the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Fair value estimates are made at a specific point&#13;in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;These estimates are subjective&#13;in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore

 ii) any risk of loss is covered&#13;by the Company&amp;#146;s customers&amp;#146; insurance

 as the customer takes possession of our product at the point of shipment.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;In&#13;the event a customer claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent on behalf of the customer
 may file a claim&#13;for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an agent on behalf of its customers
 but&#13;may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper keeps the damaged product.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;Company will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the Company receives reimbursement&#13;or credit from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an accrual for returns for&#13;damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company estimates that
 based on historical&#13;trends

 the Company will accept those two types of items back as returns. The amount for&#13;these two types of returns are estimated

 as the customer takes possession of our product at the point of shipment.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;In&#13;the event a customer claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent on behalf of the customer
 may file a claim&#13;for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an agent on behalf of its customers
 but&#13;may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper keeps the damaged product.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The&#13;Company will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the Company receives reimbursement&#13;or credit from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an accrual for returns for&#13;damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company estimates that
 based on historical&#13;trends

 the Company will accept those two types of items back as returns. The amount for&#13;these two types of returns are estimated

to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer
accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current economic industry trends
 and changes
in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability.
If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#146;s assessment
 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible
amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.

of the financing agreement with Sterling previously entered into on February 17
 2009 (the &#147;Financing Agreement&#148;).
Prior to the Modification Agreement
 the Financing Agreement
 as amended
 provided for a credit facility in which we had a revolving
line of credit for a maximum of $7
000

of the line of credit from an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate of 3.75% to an interest rate per annum equal to
the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate; and (iv) require the Company to pay
 upon the occurrence of certain termination events
 a prepayment
premium of 0.50% of the maximum amount of the credit facility in effect as of the date of the termination event.


 the Financing Agreement remains in
full force and effect. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
 we are able to draw on the loan Facility up to an amount of 85%
of eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible inventory consisting of green coffee beans and finished coffee not to exceed
$1
000
000. The Loan Facility is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company.

 2015 or 2014.&#160;&#160;In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#160;&#160;The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible.&#160;&#160;Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.&#160;&#160;Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections
for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes
it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.&#160;&#160;The amount of the
deferred tax asset considered realizable
 however
 could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are
reduced.

Approximately 54% of the Company&#146;s sales were derived from
one customer during the year ended October 31
 2015.&#160;&#160;This customer also accounted for approximately $4
113
000 or 38%
of the Company&#146;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2015.&#160;&#160;&#160;Approximately 60% of the Company&#146;s
sales were derived from one customer during the year ended October 31

$7

000 or 48% of the Company&#146;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Concentration of credit risk
with respect to other trade receivables is limited due to the short payment terms generally extended by the Company
 by ongoing
credit evaluations of customers
 and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts and other allowances that management believes
will adequately provide for credit losses.


 2015
 approximately
64% of the Company&#146;s purchases were from five vendors.&#160;&#160;&#160;These five vendors accounted for approximately $2

of the Company&#146;s accounts payable at October 31
 2015.&#160;&#160;For the year ended October 31
 2014
 approximately 61%
of the Company&#146;s purchases were from four vendors.&#160;&#160;These four vendors accounted for approximately $4
104
000 of
the Company&#146;s accounts payable at October 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Management does not believe the loss of any one vendor would
have a material adverse effect of the Company&#146;s operations due to the availability of many alternate suppliers.

Fair value is the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
not adjusted for transaction costs.&#160;&#160;The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3) as described below:


in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company;


that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable
 either directly or indirectly;


the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]





The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company
 Organic Products Trading Company
 LLC (&#147;OPTCO&#148;) and Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&#147;GCC&#148;).&#160;&#160;All
significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.




The preparation of the Company&#146;s financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.&#160;&#160;Significant estimates include allowance for uncollectible
accounts receivable and reserves
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 intangible asset valuations and useful lives
 taxes
 contingencies
and valuation of financial instruments. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available
 and any
adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts.




Cash consists primarily of unrestricted cash on deposit at financial
institutions and brokerage firms.




Prepaid coffee is an item that emanates from
OPTCO.&#160;&#160;The balance represents advance payments made by OPTCO to several coffee growing cooperatives for the purchase
of green coffee.&#160;&#160;Interest is charged to the cooperatives for these advances.&#160;&#160;Interest earned was $45
049
and $40
334 as of October 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.&#160;&#160;The prepaid coffee balance was $620
452 and $467
155 as of
October 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.




Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects
to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer
accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current economic industry trends
 and changes
in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability.
If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#146;s assessment
 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible
amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.


estimated discount that customers will take upon payment.&#160;&#160;The reserve for other allowances represents the estimated
amount of returns
 slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by the Company from its customers.&#160;&#160;The
allowances are summarized as follows:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (First in
 first
out basis) or market
 including provisions for obsolescence commensurate with known or estimated exposures. There are no
reserves for obsolescence as of October 31
 2015 and 2014. There are no reserves for obsolescence as of October 31
 2015 and 2014.




Machinery and equipment are recorded at cost
and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.&#160;&#160;Purchases of machinery
and equipment and additions and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized at cost.&#160;&#160;Expenditures
which do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred.&#160;&#160;The Company
also provides for amortization of leasehold improvements.




The commodities held at broker represent the
market value of the Company&#146;s trading account
 which consists of option and future contracts for coffee held with a brokerage
firm.&#160;&#160;The Company uses options and futures contracts
 which are not designated or qualifying as hedging instruments
to partially hedge the effects of fluctuations in the price of green coffee beans.&#160;&#160;Options and futures contracts are
recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements with current recognition of gains and losses on such positions.&#160;&#160;The
Company's accounting for options and futures contracts may increase earnings volatility in any particular period.

At October 31
 2015
 the Company held 20 options covering an aggregate of 750

 the Company held 60 futures
contracts (generally with terms of three to four months) for the purchase of 2
250

The Company has determined that its goodwill and trademarks
 which
consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have an indefinite useful life.&#160;&#160;The value of the goodwill
and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation.&#160;&#160;Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized but are assigned
to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event or when
circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&#146;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair value.&#160;&#160;As
of October 31
 2015 and 2014
 the Company has determined by using a qualitative assessment that an impairment did not exist.&#160;&#160;In
2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other &#150; Testing
Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform
the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.&#160;&#160;Under this amendment
 an entity would not be required to calculate
the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a qualitative assessment
 that it is more likely than
not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity
to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.




Customer list and relationships consist of a specific customer lists
and customer contracts obtained by the Company in the acquisition of OPTCO which are being amortized on the straight-line method
over their estimated useful life of twenty years.




The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotion as incurred.&#160;&#160;Advertising
costs charged to operations totaled $157
922 and $142
552 for the years ended October 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.




income taxes pursuant to the
deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed for temporary differences
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the
future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.&#160;&#160;Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current or non-current based on their characteristics. Valuation allowances
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.&#160;&#160;The income tax provision
or benefit is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.




Basic earnings per common share were computed by dividing net income
by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.&#160;&#160;&#160;Diluted earnings per common share is computed
by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of common shares
issuable upon exercise of potential sources of dilution.


of basic and diluted earnings per share were 6
212
929 and 6
333
212 for the years ended October 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The
267
000 shares that could be exercised pursuant to the warrant agreement attached to the units issued in September 2011 have not
been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because of their anti-dilutive impact.




The carrying amounts of cash
 accounts receivable
notes receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.&#160;&#160;The
carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at which
the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities.&#160;&#160;Fair value estimates are made at a specific point
in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available.&#160;&#160;These estimates are subjective
in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
 cannot be determined with precision.&#160;&#160;Changes
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.




The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with the authoritative guidance.&#160;&#160;Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers
upon the Company&#146;s shippers taking possession of the goods at the time of shipment because i) title passes in accordance
with the terms of the Company&#146;s purchase orders and with its agreements with its customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered
by the Company&#146;s customers&#146; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price
is determinable and v) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.&#160;&#160;Thus
 revenue is recognized at
the point of shipment to its customers.


for damaged goods on packaged coffee and usable green coffee
 as the customer takes possession of our product at the point of shipment.&#160;&#160;In
the event a customer claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent on behalf of the customer
 may file a claim
for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an agent on behalf of its customers
 but
may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper keeps the damaged product.&#160;&#160;The
Company will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the Company receives reimbursement
or credit from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an accrual for returns for
damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial.&#160;&#160;The Company estimates that
 based on historical
trends
 that future returns for damaged goods should also be immaterial.

 the Company will accept those two types of items back as returns. The amount for
these two types of returns are estimated
 accrued and recognized at the date of sale. These amounts are included in the determination
of net sales.

is created.&#160;&#160;The amounts are included in the determination of net sales.

involve rebates or refunds of a specific amount of cash consideration that are redeemable only if the reseller completes a specified
cumulative level of sales transactions.&#160;&#160;Under incentive programs of this nature
 the Company estimates and accrues the
cost of the rebate when it is taken by the reseller.&#160;&#160;These amounts are included in the determination of net sales.


the Company will agree to reimburse the reseller for a portion of the costs incurred by the reseller to advertise and promote certain
of the Company&#146;s products.&#160;&#160;The Company estimates
 accrues and recognizes the cost of cooperative advertising programs
in the period in which the advertising and promotional activity first takes place.&#160;&#160;The costs of these incentives are
included in advertising expense.




Revenue earned from shipping and handling fees
is reflected in net sales.&#160;&#160;Costs associated with shipping product to customers aggregating approximately $1
352

and $1
374
000 for the years ended October 31
 2015 and 2014

The Company has operating lease agreements for
its corporate office and warehouses
 some of which contain provisions for future rent increases or periods in which rent payments
are abated.&#160;&#160;Operating leases which provide for lease payments that vary materially from the straight-line basis are
adjusted for financial accounting purposes to reflect rental income or expense on the straight-line basis in accordance with the
authoritative guidance issued by the FASB.&#160;&#160;The excess of straight-line rent over actual payments by the Company of $222

 2015 and 2014
 respectively.




Investee companies that are not consolidated
but over which the Company exercises significant influence
 are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.&#160;&#160;Whether
or not the Company exercises significant influence with respect to an Investee depends on an evaluation of several factors including
among others
 representation on the Investee company&#146;s board of directors and ownership level
 which is generally a 20% to
50% interest in the voting securities of the Investee company.&#160;&#160;Under the equity method of accounting
 an Investee company&#146;s
accounts are not reflected within the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income; however

Investment in short-term money-market instruments (such as commercial paper
 banker's acceptances
 repurchase agreements
 government securities
 certificates of deposit
 and so forth) which are highly liquid (that is
 readily convertible to known amounts of cash) and so near their maturity that they present an insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally
 only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify as cash equivalents by definition. Original maturity means an original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.
