ITEM
1 - BUSINESS



Liberated
Solutions
 Inc. is a Nevada corporation formed on September 14
 2011. We were incorporated as Mega World Food Holding Company
for the purpose of selling frozen vegetable products in all areas of the world except China.



On
January 19
 2013
 pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
 dated January 7
 2013
 Perpetual Wind Power Corporation
 a privately
held corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 1
 2010
 acquired 24
500
000 non-registered shares of
the Company from its shareholders
 thereby owning 24
500
000 out of a total of 25
000
000 issued and outstanding shares of the
Company. Thereafter
 the Company acquired from Perpetual Wind Power Corporation its patented wind and solar powered turbine technology
for 2
500
000 newly issued shares of the Company which were distributed in a dividend to its shareholders and Perpetual Wind Power
Corporation returned to treasury its 24
500
000 shares it acquired from the Company&rsquo;s shareholders. As a result of this
transaction
 the Company had on January 19
 2013
 3
000
000 shares issued and outstanding. On February 14
 2013
 the Company changed
its name from Mega World Food Holding Company to The Go Eco Group
 Inc. and underwent a 24 for 1 stock split
 whereby the Company&rsquo;s
outstanding shares increased from 3
000
000 to 72
000
000.

Services
and Products

On
January 19
 2013
 the Company disposed of its wholly-owned subsidiary
 Mega World Food Limited (HK). Mega World Food Limited (HK)
was incorporated on June 24
 2010 and was in the business of selling frozen vegetables in all areas of the world except China.
From inception
 Mega World Food Limited (HK) only incurred setting up
 formation or organization activities. Upon disposal
 the
Company ceased these operations and accordingly
 the Company&rsquo;s financial statements have been prepared with the net assets
results of operations
 and cash flows of this business displayed separately as &ldquo;discontinued operations.&rdquo;

On
January 23
 2013
 we acquired from Perpetual Wind Power Corporation the rights to their wind and solar powered turbine technology
for which it has a patent pending with the United States Patent and Trademark office
 U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 61/257
578
as submitted on November 3
 2009.

In
November 2013
 we built and successfully tested an alternative energy LED lighting and security system that is now available to
the market. The Guard Lite&trade; security lighting system is designed to deter trespassers from homes and/or properties without
electricity costs. The Company has moved towards patent protection of this new device. It is anticipated that the Guard Lite&trade;
security lighting system will only require a portion of the energy it generates so the excess energy will be able to be used for
other applications.

On
July 6
 2016
 the Company adopted a 1-for-3
500 reverse split of the Company&rsquo;s common stock.

On
September 14
 2016
 the Company entered into an agreement with Ron Knori (Kroni) Owner of EcoCab Portland
 LLC by which the Company
was to acquire all outstanding ECGLLC membership interest for a 20% non-dilutive interest of the outstanding shares of the Company
with the first closing of the agreement. On March 6
 2017
 the Company terminated the agreements with Ron Knori and EcoCab based
upon breach of contract
 fraud
 fraudulent inducement
 fraud in the factum
 negligent misrepresentation
 misrepresentation
 contractual
interference
 breach of fiduciary duty
 negligence
 and conversion
 all of which were perpetrated by Ron Knori
 individually
and in his capacity as manager of EcoCab.


    
    


On
January 27
 2017
 the Company reduced the authorized shares of common stock from 10
000
000
000 to 2
000
000
000 and changed the
name from The Go Eco Group
 Inc to The Go Eco Group.

On
August 15
 2017
 we entered into an agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) with Medsite Services
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation
(&ldquo;MDST&rdquo;) wherein we agreed to acquire from MDST
 all of MDST&rsquo;s right
 title and interest in and to Integro Health
Systems
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation (&ldquo;Integro&rdquo;). MDST has represented to us that it owns 100% of the outstanding securities
of Integro and Integro is a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of MDST. We closed this transaction on August 28
 2017 and accordingly
Integro became wholly owned by us. In consideration of the foregoing
 we issued 1
170
005 restricted shares of our Series B Preferred
Stock to certain shareholders of MDST as disclosed in the Agreement. As part of the consideration for the foregoing transaction
we and our president
 Brian Conway cancelled 9
000
000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock owned by Mr. Conway and amend the
Series A Preferred Stock designation to reflect each share of Series A Preferred Stock has 10
000 votes per share and votes with
the common on certain matters. The amended designation of the Series A Preferred Stock has been filed with the Nevada Secretary
of State. Likewise
 the designation for the Series B Preferred Stock has been filed with the Nevada Secretary of State.

On
December 21
 2017 the company formed a joint venture with Bravatek Solutions
 Inc a Colorado corporation. Under the terms of the
agreement the Company will own 65% of the joint venture and contribute $100 plus a nonexclusive license of the intellectual property
necessary to develop the Light Guard System with Bravatek contributing $25
000 plus the sale of software to the JV for $65
000.
The joint venture was terminated and the $25
000 was treated as paid in capital upon the termination.

On
January 23
 2018
 the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary
 BitWhisper
 LLC
 in the state of Nevada. The purpose of the subsidiary
is to be a special purpose vehicle for exploring operations in crypto-currency mining. The Company has no intentions of offering
crypto-currencies
 whether as security tokens or utility tokens
 to the public.

On
February 5
 2018
 Go Eco Group
 a Nevada corporation (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) entered into a Mutual Rescission and Release
with Medsites Services
 LLC whereby the parties agreed to mutually rescind the Stock Exchange Agreement between the parties and
releasing each party from any liabilities for damages
 claims or causes of action arising from the Stock Exchange Agreement. Per
the terms of the Mutual Release and Rescission
 Medsites Services
 LLC agreed to pay a &ldquo;break-off&rdquo; fee of $40
000.00
to be paid in payments over sixty (60) days from the execution of the Mutual Release and Rescission.

On
February 28
 2018 the Company changed its name to Liberated Solutions
 Inc.

On
August 23
 2018
 the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) with Peppermint Jim
 LLC (&ldquo;Peppermint
Jim&rdquo;) whereby the Company shall acquire 51 units (representing 51% of Peppermint Jim) in exchange for the issuance of $250
000
worth of Series B preferred stock of the Company (the &ldquo;Series B Preferred Shares&rdquo;). Under the terms of the Agreement
the closing of the transaction shall occur on or before August 31
 2018
 where the Series B Preferred Shares shall be issued in
exchange for the 51 units of Peppermint Jim.


    
    


On
December 26
 2018 the Company filed an amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada increasing the authorized shares to 6
000
000
000
from 2
000
000
000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. The authorized shares of preferred shares remained at 10
000
000
with a par value of $0.001

On

 2018
 the Company and Peppermint Jim
 LLC (&ldquo;Peppermint Jim&rdquo;) mutually agreed to terminate and rescind

On

 2016
 LG Capital

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially. See &ldquo;Item
1A. Risk Factors&rdquo; for a discussion of certain risks. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to
reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.

As

 unless the context otherwise requires
 the terms &ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;us
&rdquo;
&ldquo;the Company
&rdquo; and &ldquo;Liberated&rdquo; refer to Liberated Solutions
 a Nevada Corporation.

ORGANIZTION
AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The
following discussion and analysis is based on the audited financial statements for the years ended September 30
 2018 and 2017
of Liberated Solutions
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation (&ldquo;Liberated&rdquo; the &ldquo;Company
&rdquo; &ldquo;our
&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;).
All significant inter-company amounts have been eliminated. In the opinion of management
 the audited financial statements presented
herein reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for fair presentation. Interim results
are not necessary indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.

We
prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 which require that management
make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Certain
of the statements contained below are forward-looking statements (rather than historical facts) that are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES &amp; ESTIMATES

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make judgments
 assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However
 future events are subject to change
and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our balance
sheet
 and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods
 are affected by estimates and assumptions
which are used for
 but not limited to
 the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts
 goodwill and intangible asset impairments
restructurings
 inventory
 and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting
policies are significantly affected by judgments
 assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements.


    
    


Use
of Estimates

It
is important to note that when preparing the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial
statements and related notes. Actual results could differ if those estimates and assumptions approve to be incorrect.

On
an ongoing basis
 we evaluate our estimates
 including those related to estimated customer life
 used to determine the appropriate
amortization period for deferred revenue and deferred costs associated with licensing fees
 the useful lives of property and equipment
and our estimates of the value of common stock for the purpose of determining stock-based compensation. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
 the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Revenue
Recognition Policies

The
Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) number 104
&ldquo;Revenue Recognition.&rdquo; SAB 104 clarifies application of U. S. generally accepted accounting principles to revenue
transactions. As of the year ended September 30
 2018
 there was no deferred revenue. The Company derives its primary revenue
from the sources described below
 which includes sale of alternative energy devices.

Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangements

We
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures
 or capital
resources that is material to investors.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
90 days or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.

Results
of Operations

Year
Ended September 30
 2018 Compared to Year Ended September 30
 2017

Revenue
and Cost of Sales

Our
revenues were zero and $48
00
 respectively
 for the years ended September 30
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. For the year ended
September 30
 2018 and 2017 we had zero and $14
000 of cost of sales
 respectively.


    
    


General
and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative costs for the year ended September 30
 2018 was $858
697 compared to $1
348
106 for the year ended September
30
 2017. The lower cost in 2018 was attributed mostly to $357
225 in stock based compensation in 2018 versus $844
164 in 2017.

Other
Income (Expense)

Other
expense was $162
441 for the year ended September 30
 2018 compared to $151
006 for the year ended September30
 2017. The higher
amount in 2018 is directly attributed to higher interest expense due to an increase in the interest rate from 12% to 22% on notes
owed to the Company&rsquo;s largest lender.

Net
Loss

The
Company incurred a net loss of $1
021
138 for the year ended September 30
 2018 compared to a net loss of $1
464
122 for the year
ended September 30
 2017. Higher general and administrative expense attributed to the higher loss in 2017 over 2018.

Financial
Condition

Cash
Cash Flows
 and Working Capital

The
Company had a cash balance of $17
978 and a working capital deficit of $731
983 at September 30. 2018 as compared to a net cash
balance of $67
353 and a working capital deficit of $1
039
703 at September 30
 2017. The change in working capital is primarily
attributable to a decrease in current liabilities in accounts payable and accrued expenses from $133
970 in 2017 to $105
166 in
2018 and a reduction of convertible debt from $973
086 in 2017 to $639
795 in 2018 off set by deferred revenue of $5
000 in 2018
verses zero in in 2017.

Operations
used $384
 375 of cash during 2018 as compared to $446
127 used during 2017. The change in operating cash flows during 2018 was
principally attributable to decreased losses in 2018 over 2017 somewhat offset by smaller stock based compensation in 2018 versus
2017.

Cash
used in investing activity during the year ended September 30
 2017 was $43
324 which consisted of loans to Eco Cab of $197
520
offset by repayments of $ 154
196 versus none in 2018. As of September 30
 2017
 the Company impaired the balance of $43
324 as
it is uncollectible.

Cash
flows provided by financing activities was $335
000 during 2018 compared to $555
000 during 2017
 derived from the issuance of
convertible notes.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Our
principal requirements for capital are to fund our day-to-day operations and to satisfy our contractual obligations
 primarily
for the repayment of debt.

We
believe that we will be required to either achieve profitability and generate operating cash flows or borrow additional funds
or otherwise secure additional financing
 or both
 to support our operations going forward. We do not presently have any commitments
to provide financing
 if needed
 to support our operations.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under
the supervision and the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer who also serves as our principal
financial officer
 we conducted an evaluation as of September 30
 2018
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934
 as amended. Based on this evaluation
 our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30
 2018.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as that term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;). Our internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately
and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP
 and that our receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
effect on our financial statements.

Internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its
inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and
is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also
can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations
 there is a risk that material misstatements
may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However
 these inherent limitations
are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
though not eliminate
 this risk. In addition
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In
order to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30
 2018
 as required by
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 our management conducted an assessment
 including testing
 based on the criteria
set forth in Internal Control&mdash;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the &ldquo;COSO Framework&rdquo;). A material weakness is a control deficiency
 or a combination of control deficiencies
 that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected.

Based
on the evaluation performed
 management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September
30
 2018. In arriving at that conclusion
 management identified as materials weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting: (1) the lack of accounting proficiency of our chief executive officer who is our sole officer and our principal accounting
officer which has resulted in a reliance on part-time outside consultants to perform substantially all of our accounting functions
(2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting process and
accounting function
 and (3) lack of control procedures that include multiple levels of review
 also arising from our chief executive
officer&rsquo;s lack of accounting training and service in multiple roles as well as our limited financial resources to support
hiring of personnel and implementation of accounting systems.


    
    


This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit smaller reporting companies to provide only management&rsquo;s
report in this annual report.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
our internal control over financial reporting.

by (i) each person known by us to own beneficially five per cent (5%) or more of the outstanding shares of each class

not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership of those shares.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Liberated Solutions
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Liberated Solutions
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of September 30
 2018
and 2017 and the related statements of operations
 shareholders&rsquo; equity and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present
fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of September 30
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30
 2018
 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Going
Concern

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements
 the Company&rsquo;s ability to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financing
to fund its operating costs is unknown
 which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s
plan in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a
test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 2013
 pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
 dated January 7
 2013
 Perpetual Wind Power Corporation
 a privately
held corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 1
 2010
 acquired 24
500
000 non-registered shares of
the Company from its shareholders
 thereby owning 24
500
000 out of a total of 25
000
000 issued and outstanding shares of the
Company. Thereafter
 the Company acquired from Perpetual Wind Power Corporation its patented wind and solar powered turbine technology
for 2
500
000 newly issued shares of the Company which were distributed in a dividend to its shareholders and Perpetual Wind Power
Corporation returned to treasury its 24
500
000 shares it acquired from the Company&rsquo;s shareholders. As a result of this
transaction
 the Company had on January 19
 2013
 3
000
000 shares issued and outstanding. On February 14
 2013
 the Company changed
its name from Mega World Food Holding Company to The Go Eco Group
 Inc. and underwent a 24 for 1 stock split
 whereby the Company&rsquo;s
outstanding shares increased from 3
000
000 to 72
000
000.

On
January 19
 2013
 the Company disposed of its wholly-owned subsidiary
 Mega World Food Limited (HK). Mega World Food Limited (HK)
was incorporated on June 24
 2010 and was in the business of selling frozen vegetables in all areas of the world except China.
From inception
 Mega World Food Limited (HK) only incurred setting up
 formation or organization activities. Upon disposal
 the
Company ceased these operations and accordingly
 the Company&rsquo;s financial statements have been prepared with the net assets

Integro became wholly owned by us. In consideration of the foregoing
 we issued 1
170
005 restricted shares of our Series B Preferred
Stock to certain shareholders of MDST as disclosed in the Agreement. As part of the consideration for the foregoing transaction
we and our president
 Brian Conway cancelled 9

Note
2 &ndash; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
of Accounting

The
Company maintains its books and records on the accrual basis of accounting. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
on that basis
 in which revenues and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred.

Use
of Estimates

The
presentation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

For
the purpose of the statement of cash flows
 cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances
 which are not subject to withdrawal
restrictions or penalties
 and highly liquid investments and debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less from the
date of purchase.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

Our
short-term financial instruments
 including cash
 other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses consist primarily of
instruments without extended maturities
 the fair value of which
 based on management&rsquo;s estimates
 reasonably approximate
their book value. The fair value of our notes and advances payable is based on management estimates and reasonably approximates
their book value based on their current maturity.

Net
Loss per Common Share

The
Company computes per share amounts in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 260
 Earnings per
Share (EPS). ASC 260 requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available
to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.

Property
Equipment
 and Intangible Assets

Property
and equipment are carried at cost
 less accumulated depreciation. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred. Intangible assets consist of acquired customer and vendor databases and are carried at cost
 less accumulated
amortization.

Depreciation
and amortization is provided principally on the straight-line basis method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees in accordance with ASC 718 requiring employee equity
awards to be accounted for under the fair value method. Accordingly
 share-based compensation is measured at grant date
 based
on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company accounts for
stock-based compensation to other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50. Equity instruments issued to other than employees
are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of the services
 based on the fair value of the equity instruments
and is recognized as expense over the service period. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payments using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model for common stock options and the closing price of the company&rsquo;s common stock for common share issuances.


    
    


Revenue
and Cost Recognition

It
is the Company&rsquo;s policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC 605 &ldquo;Revenue
Recognition&rdquo;. Four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management&rsquo;s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices
of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated
returns and allowances
 and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company
will defer any revenue for which the product was not delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the
customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.

Income
Taxes

The
Company utilizes ASC 740 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
method
 deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates
applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Temporary differences between taxable
income reported for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes primarily relate to the recognition of debt costs and
stock based compensation expense. The adoption of ASC 740-10 did not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of
operations or financial condition.

RECLASSIFICATION
OF PRIOR YEAR BALANCES

Certain
items from the year ended September 30
 2017 have been reclassified to conform with the current year financial statement presentation.

Note
3 &ndash; Going Concern Matters

As
shown in the accompanying financial statements
 the Company has a net loss of $1
021
128 for the year ended September 30
 2018.
As of September 30
 2018
 the Company reported an accumulated deficit of $3
886
928. The Company&rsquo;s ability to generate continued
positive cash flows is dependent on the ability to grow its operating entity as well as the ability to raise additional capital.
Management is following strategic plans to accomplish these objectives
 but success is not guaranteed. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


    
    


NOTE
4 &ndash; FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

As
defined in (Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 820)
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company
utilized the market data of similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs
can be readily observable
 market corroborated
 or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on
the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure
fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:




    
    
Quoted prices are
    available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which
    transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing
    basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities and
    listed equities. 

    
    
    

    
    
Pricing inputs are
    other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
    reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These
    models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward prices for commodities
    time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
 as well as other
    relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term
    of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed
    in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
    interest rate swaps
 options and collars.

    
    
    

    
    
Pricing inputs include
    significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed
    methodologies that result in management&rsquo;s best estimate of fair value.

    
    
    

    
    
Management has determined
    based on note conversion history that the conversion value is equal or less than par value of the shares used for conversion
    thus determining that the fair value of the notes is equal to their face value.

160
000 warrants to Crown Bridge
Partners as part of the $80
000 of the loans advanced in January

exercisable by the holder within five years of the issuance date at $0.25 per warrant for the January and February 2018 warrants
and at $0.01 for the March 2018 warrant. The warrants may be converted by the holder as a cashless warrant. The warrants and the
convertible notes were fair valued on date of issuance using the Black Scholes valuation method.

The
following assumptions were used in estimating the value of the warrants issued in January
 February and March 2018



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    


The
fair value of the warrants determined to be 25% of the total value of the warrants and convertible debt. Based on the valuation
$20
000 of the convertible debt was deducted from the note value and allocated to paid in capital.

During
the year ended September 30
 2018 the cashless warrants were converted into 34
967
577 shares of common stock with a value of
$40
074.

 2018
Moore Capital LLC the Company owes principal of $18
975 plus interest of $1
419 for a total of $20
394.

Management
has reviewed the terms of the convertible instruments to determine their fair value. After reviewing the characteristic and the
value of the conversion
 management has determined based on note conversion history that the conversion value is equal or less
than par value of the shares used for conversion thus determining that the fair value of the notes is equal to their face value.



    
    


Note
8 &ndash; Income Taxes

The
Company follows Accounting Standards Codification 740
 Accounting for Income Taxes.

The
Company had a net loss of $1
021
138 for the year ended September 30
 2018 and $1
464
122 for the same period in 2017. As of September
30
 2018
 the Company&rsquo;s net operating loss carry forward was approximately $2
119
728 that will begin to expire in the year
2035.

The
Company&rsquo;s deferred tax assets consisted of the following as of September 30
 2018
 and 2017:



    
    
    

    
445
143
214
439

    
(445
143
(214
439

    
    
    


In
assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversals of future deferred tax assets
 projected future taxable income
 and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
As a result
 management determined it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would not be realized as of September 30
2018.

A
reconciliation of income taxes at the federal statutory rate to amounts provided for the years ended September 30
 2018 and 2017
is as follows:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    


Based
on the recent change in corporation tax rates the Company calculated the deferred tax asset for the year ended September 30
 2018
and 2017 at 21%.

NOTE
9 &ndash; LEGAL

On
September 15
 2016
 LG Capital
 LLC filed a lawsuit against the Company in the County of Kings
 in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York (index number 516298/2016). The filing alleges that the Company has defaulted on several unpaid loans from LG Capital
to the Company with the total owing and due including principal and interest of $297
160. The Company has not counter claimed
but believes that LG Capital unlawfully attempted to convert some of the loans to common stock of the Company has filed an injunction
against the Company transfer agent to block LG Capital from such a conversion. In addition
 the Company negotiated in good faith
with LG Capital to settle the debt but to no avail. After reviewing the claim made by LG Capital
 is the opinion of management
that the outstanding liability to LG Capital has been fully recognized and accounted for in the financial statements of the Company.

000 which is
awaiting a decision by the trustee and confirmation of the bankruptcy court of any settlement.

 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not&#13;be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods&#13;in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets
&#13;projected future taxable income
 and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result
 management determined it was&#13;more likely than not the deferred tax assets would not be realized as of September 30

000 non-registered shares of the Company from its shareholders
thereby owning 24
500
000 out of a total of 25
000
000 issued and outstanding shares of the Company. Thereafter

000 newly issued shares
of the Company which were distributed in a dividend to its shareholders and Perpetual Wind Power Corporation returned to treasury
its 24
500
000 shares it acquired from the Company&#8217;s shareholders. As a result of this transaction
 the Company had on January
19
 2013
 3
000
000 shares issued and outstanding. On February 14
 2013
 the Company changed its name from Mega World Food Holding
Company to The Go Eco Group
 Inc. and underwent a 24 for 1 stock split
 whereby the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares increased
from 3
000
000 to 72
000
000.


 2013
 the Company disposed

000
000 to 2
000
000

Note
2 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
of Accounting


records on the accrual basis of accounting. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on that basis
 in which revenues
and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred.

Use
of Estimates


in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents


cash flows
 cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances
 which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties
and highly liquid investments and debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments


including cash
 other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities
the fair value of which
 based on management&#8217;s estimates
 reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of our
notes and advances payable is based on management estimates and reasonably approximates their book value based on their current
maturity.

Net
Loss per Common Share


in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 260
 Earnings per Share (EPS). ASC 260 requires presentation
of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.

Property
 Equipment
 and Intangible
Assets


cost
 less accumulated depreciation. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Intangible assets consist of acquired customer and vendor databases and are carried at cost
 less accumulated amortization.


principally on the straight-line basis method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.




compensation to employees and non-employees in accordance with ASC 718 requiring employee equity awards to be accounted for under
the fair value method. Accordingly
 share-based compensation is measured at grant date
 based on the fair value of the award and
is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to other
than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50. Equity instruments issued to other than employees are valued at the earlier
of a commitment date or upon completion of the services
 based on the fair value of the equity instruments and is recognized as
expense over the service period. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model for common stock options and the closing price of the company&#8217;s common stock for common share issuances.

Revenue
and Cost Recognition


revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC 605 &#8220;Revenue Recognition&#8221;. Four basic
criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred;
(3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and
(4) are based on management&#8217;s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the
collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated returns and allowances
 and other
adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the
product was not delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the
product has been delivered or no refund will be required.

Income
Taxes


Taxes&#8221; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method
 deferred income taxes are recognized
for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Temporary differences between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes and income
tax purposes primarily relate to the recognition of debt costs and stock based compensation expense. The adoption of ASC 740-10
did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations or financial condition.

statements
 the Company has a net loss of $1

128 for the year ended September 30
 2018. As of September 30
 2018
 the Company
reported an accumulated deficit of $3
886
928. The Company&#8217;s ability to generate continued positive cash flows is dependent
on the ability to grow its operating entity as well as the ability to raise additional capital. Management is following strategic
plans to accomplish these objectives
 but success is not guaranteed. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

Standards Board ASC 820)
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of similar
entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions
about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).


are as follows:



    
    
Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities and listed equities.

    
    
    

    
    
Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
 as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.

Basis
of Accounting


records on the accrual basis of accounting. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on that basis
 in which revenues
and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred.





Use
of Estimates


in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.





Cash
and Cash Equivalents


cash flows
 cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances
 which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties
and highly liquid investments and debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.





Fair
Value of Financial Instruments


including cash
 other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities
the fair value of which
 based on management&#8217;s estimates
 reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of our
notes and advances payable is based on management estimates and reasonably approximates their book value based on their current
maturity.





Net
Loss per Common Share


in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 260
 Earnings per Share (EPS). ASC 260 requires presentation
of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.

principally on the straight-line basis method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.








compensation to employees and non-employees in accordance with ASC 718 requiring employee equity awards to be accounted for under
the fair value method. Accordingly
 share-based compensation is measured at grant date
 based on the fair value of the award and
is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to other
than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50. Equity instruments issued to other than employees are valued at the earlier
of a commitment date or upon completion of the services
 based on the fair value of the equity instruments and is recognized as
expense over the service period. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model for common stock options and the closing price of the company&#8217;s common stock for common share issuances.





Revenue
and Cost Recognition


revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC 605 &#8220;Revenue Recognition&#8221;. Four basic
criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred;
(3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and
(4) are based on management&#8217;s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the
collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated returns and allowances
 and other
adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the
product was not delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the
product has been delivered or no refund will be required.





Income
Taxes


Taxes&#8221; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method
 deferred income taxes are recognized
for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences
are expected to affect taxable income. Temporary differences between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes
and income tax purposes primarily relate to the recognition of debt costs and stock based compensation expense. The adoption of
ASC 740-10 did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations or financial condition.
