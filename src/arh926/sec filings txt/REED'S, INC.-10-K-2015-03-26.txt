We
sell our products throughout the US and in select international markets. We started in specialty gourmet and natural food stores
and have moved more into mainstream over time. We estimate that our products are in approximately 40
000 accounts in the US with
approximately 12

 supermarkets. We sell our products through a network of natural
 gourmet and beer
distributors and direct to certain large national retailers.

We
produce and co-pack our beverage products in part at our facility in Los Angeles
 California
 known as the Brewery
 and with the
majority produced at a contracted co-packing facility in Pennsylvania. The co-pack facility in Pennsylvania supplies us with soda
products for the eastern half of the United States and nationally for soda products that we do not produce at The Brewery.

    and capture more of the 35
000 supermarkets nationwide

    uses for our products


    
    
    

    
    
develop
    and produce private-label products for select customers

Historical
Development

Reed&rsquo;s
Original Ginger Brew was created in 1987 by Christopher J. Reed
 our founder and Chief Executive Officer
 and was introduced to
the market in Southern California stores in 1989. By 1990
 we began marketing our products through United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI)
and other natural food distributors and moved our production to a larger facility in Boulder
 Colorado.

In
1991
 we incorporated our business operations in the state of Florida under the name of Original Beverage Corporation and moved
all of our production to a co-pack facility in Pennsylvania. Throughout the 1990&rsquo;s
 we continued to develop and launch new
Ginger Brew varieties. Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Brews reached broad placement in natural and gourmet foods stores nationwide through
UNFI and other major specialty
 natural/gourmet and mainstream food and beverage distributors.

In
1997
 we began licensing the products of China Cola and eventually acquired the rights to that product in 2000. In 1999
 we purchased
the Virgil&rsquo;s Root Beer brand from the Crowley Beverage Company. In 2000
 we moved into an 18
000 square foot warehouse property
the Brewery
 in Los Angeles
 California
 to house our west coast production and warehouse facility. The Brewery also serves as
our principal executive offices. In 2001
 pursuant to a reincorporation merger
 we changed our state of incorporation to Delaware
and also changed our name to &ldquo;Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc.&rdquo;

On
December 12
 2006
 we completed the sale of 2
000
000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $4.00 per share in our
initial public offering. The public offering resulted in gross proceeds of $8
000
000. Following the public offering
 we expanded
sales and operations dramatically
 initially using a direct store delivery strategy in Southern California
 along with other regional
independent direct store distributors (DSD). The relationships with DSD&rsquo;s were supported by our sales staff. In 2007 we
raised a net of $7
600
000 in a private placement. We re-focused our sales strategy to eliminate company direct store delivery
sales and to expand sales to DSD&rsquo;s and natural food distributors on a national level. We also started selling directly to
supermarket grocery stores
 which has become a significant portion of our business today.

We
continually introduce new products and line extensions
 such as our Virgil&rsquo;s diet line of ZERO beverages introduced in 2010
and Dr. Better and Light 55 Calories Extra Ginger Brew in 2011. We commenced offering private label products in 2010 and have
increased that business significantly in 2012 and 2013. In 2012
 we launched four flavors of our Culture Club Kombucha line that
in 2013 was increased to eight flavors. In 2014
 we launched Culture Club Coffee Kombucha.

Industry
Overview

We
offer natural premium carbonated soft drinks (CSD)
 which are a growing segment of the $10 billion CSD market nationwide. Within
natural food store markets
 we are among the top-selling natural soft drinks. This market is steady and growing. We also sell
in major grocery chains nationally. The trend in grocery stores is to expand offerings of natural products and we have the scale
and capability to develop these direct customer relationships.

Our
Products

We
currently manufacture and sell 31 beverages
 four candies and three ice creams. We make all of our products using premium all-natural
ingredients and our beverage line is GMO free. Our primary brands are our Reed&rsquo;s ginger brew line
 our Virgil&rsquo;s line
of root beer and our Culture Club Kombucha. Our candy products that include Reed&rsquo;s Crystallized Ginger Candy and Reed&rsquo;s
Chews represent a lesser portion of revenues
 however
 the products are popular and sales are expanding. We also sell ginger ice
cream.

Reed&rsquo;s
Ginger Brews

Ginger
ale is the oldest known soft drink. Before modern soft drink technology existed
 non-alcoholic beverages were brewed at home directly
from herbs
 roots
 spices
 and fruits. These handcrafted brews were highly prized for their taste and their tonic
 health-giving
properties. Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Brews are a revival of this lost art of home brewing sodas. We make them with care and attention
to wholesomeness and quality
 using the finest fresh herbs
 roots
 spices
 and fruits.

We
believe that Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Brews are unique in their kettle-brewed origin among all mass-marketed soft drinks. Reed&rsquo;s
Ginger Brews contain between 8 and 26 grams of fresh ginger in every 12-ounce bottle. We use pure cane sugar as the sweetener.
Our products differ from commercial soft drinks in three particular characteristics: sweetening
 carbonation and coloring for
greater adult appeal. Instead of using injected-based carbonation
 we produce our carbonation naturally
 through slower
 beer-oriented
techniques. This process produces smaller
 longer lasting bubbles that do not dissipate rapidly when the bottle is opened. We
do not add coloring. The color of our products comes naturally from herbs
 fruits
 spices
 roots and juices and our beverages
are GMO free.


    
    


In
addition
 since Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Brews are pasteurized
 they do not require or contain any preservatives. In contrast
 modern
commercial soft drinks generally are produced using natural and artificial flavor concentrates prepared by flavor laboratories
tap water
 and highly refined sweeteners. Typically
 manufacturers make a centrally processed concentrate that will lend itself
to a wide variety of situations
 waters and filling systems. The final product is generally cold-filled and requires preservatives
for stability. Colors are added that are either natural
 although highly processed
 or artificial.

Our
Reed&rsquo;s line contains the following products:



    
    
Reed&rsquo;s
    Original Ginger Brew
    root
 lemon
 lime
 honey
 raw cane sugar
 pineapple
 herbs and spices. Reed&rsquo;s Original Ginger Brew is 20% fruit juice.

    and contains 17 grams of fresh ginger root.

    
    
    

    
    
Reed&rsquo;s
    Raspberry Ginger Brew
 raspberry juice and lime. Reed&rsquo;s Raspberry Ginger
    Brew is 20% raspberry juice.

    cloves and allspice. Reed&rsquo;s Spiced Apple Brew is 50% apple juice.

    juices and exotic spices.

Virgil&rsquo;s
Root Beer

Virgil&rsquo;s
is a premium craft root beer. We use all-natural ingredients
 including filtered water
 unbleached cane sugar
 anise from Spain
licorice from France
 bourbon vanilla from Madagascar
 cinnamon from Sri Lanka
 clove from Indonesia
 wintergreen from China
sweet birch and molasses from the southern United States
 nutmeg from Indonesia
 pimento berry oil from Jamaica
 balsam oil from
Peru and cassia oil from China. We collect these ingredients worldwide and gather them together at the brewing and bottling facilities.
We combine these ingredients under strict specifications and finally heat-pasteurize Virgil&rsquo;s Root Beer
 to ensure quality.
We sell Virgil&rsquo;s Root Beer in three packaging styles: 12-ounce bottles in a four-pack
 a special swing-lid style pint bottle
and a 5-liter self-tapping party keg. The Virgil&rsquo;s soda line is GMO free.

consumers
 Kombucha is believed to have healing and cleansing characteristics. Sweetened tea is introduced to a &ldquo;starter&rdquo;
culture and lightly fermented to produce an acetic drink. We make the finest Kombucha possible
 using a combination of Oolong
and Yerba Mate teas
 spring water and a combination of ginger
 organic juices and flavors Initially
 we produced four flavors

 including swing-lid bottles

facility is certified as SQF level 2 compliant.

New
Product Development

We
are always working on ideas and products to continue expanding our Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Brews
 Virgil&rsquo;s product line
 Reed&rsquo;s
Ginger Candy and Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Ice Cream product lines and packaging styles. Among the advantages of our self-operated Brewery
are the flexibility to try innovative packaging and the capability to experiment with new product flavors at less cost to our
operations or capital.

Our
private label products require continual product development. We are able to be nimble and innovative
 producing new products
in a short amount of time.

Manufacture
of Our Products

We
produce our carbonated beverages at two facilities:



    
    
a
    facility in Los Angeles
 California
 known as The Brewery
 at which we currently produce Kombucha
 certain soda products and
    our private label products
 and

    
    
    

    
    
a
    packing
 or co-pack
 facility in Pennsylvania which supplies us with product we do not produce at The Brewery. The co-packer
    assembles our products and charges us a fee
 generally by the case
 for the products they produce.


We
follow a &ldquo;fill as needed&rdquo; manufacturing model to the best of our ability and we have no significant backlog of orders.
Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation
 bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or
by our contract packers in accordance with our specifications. Reed&rsquo;s Crystallized Ginger is made to our specifications
in Fiji. Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Candy Chews are made and packed to our specifications in Indonesia.

Generally
we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and each ingredient has several reliable suppliers. We
have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. As a general policy
 we pick ingredients in the development of our products
that have multiple suppliers and are common ingredients. This provides a level of protection against a major supply constriction
or calamity.

We
believe that as we continue to grow
 we will be able to keep up with increased production demands. We believe that the Brewery
has ample capacity to handle increased West Coast business. To the extent that any significant increase in business requires us
to supplement or substitute our current co-packers
 we believe that there are readily available alternatives
 so that there would
not be a significant delay or interruption in fulfilling orders and delivery of our products. In addition
 we do not believe that
growth will result in any significant difficulty or delay in obtaining raw materials
 ingredients or finished product that is
repackaged at the Brewery.

Our
Primary Markets 

We
target a niche in the estimated $60 billion carbonated and non-carbonated soft drink markets in the US
 Canada and International
markets. Our brands are generally regarded as premium and natural
 with upscale packaging and are loosely defined as the artisanal
(craft)
 premium bottled carbonated soft drink category.

The
soft drink industry is highly fragmented and the craft soft drink category consists of such competitors as
 Henry Weinhards
 Thomas
Kemper
 Hansen&rsquo;s
 Izze
 Boylan and Jones Soda
 to name a few. These brands have the advantage of being seen widely in the
national market and being commonly known for years through well-funded ad campaigns. Despite our products having a relatively
high price for an artisanal premium beverage product
 no mass media advertising and a relatively small but growing presence in
the mainstream market compared to many of our competitors
 we believe that results to date demonstrate that Reed&rsquo;s Ginger
Brews and Virgil&rsquo;s sodas are making strong inroads and market share gains against some of the larger brands in the market.


    
    


Kombucha
is the largest growth segment of the functional beverage category of drinks and foods
 including coconut water
 yogurt and fresh
juices. Among this broader category
 the refrigerated juices and functional beverages segment grew by approximately $200 million
in 2012 to an estimated market of approximately $600 million (50% growth)
 according to SPINS data. Kombucha comprises the overwhelming
majority share of this explosive growth and comprises most of the segment. It is generally believed that the segment will continue
to expand at a strong rate over the next few years. Other functional drinks in this category are also expanding sales at healthy
rates
 primarily coconut water and fresh pressed juices. Consumer awareness and demand for functional drinks is increasing and
we feel that Kombucha and other cultured drinks will be in the forefront of this expanding market category.

We
sell the majority of our products in the natural food store
 mainstream supermarket chains and foodservice locations
 primarily
in the United States and
 to a lesser degree
 in Canada and Europe.

Natural
Food Stores

Our
primary and historical marketing and distribution source of our products has been natural food and gourmet stores throughout the
US. These stores include Whole Foods Market
 Trader Joe&rsquo;s
 Sprouts
 Sunflowers
 Earth Fare
 and New Seasons
 just to name
a few. Our brands are also sold in gourmet restaurants and deli&rsquo;s nationwide. With the advent of large natural food store
chains and specialty merchants
 the natural foods segment continues to grow each year
 helping fuel the continued growth of our
brands.

Mainstream
Supermarkets and Retailers

We
also sell our products to direct store delivery distributors (DSD) who specialize in distributing and selling our products directly
to mainstream retail channels
 natural foods
 and specialty retail stores. Our brands are further sold directly to some retailers
who require that we sell directly to their distribution centers since they have developed their own logistics capabilities. Examples
of chains that fall into the &ldquo;direct&rdquo; category are retailers such as
 Costco
 Trader Joe&rsquo;s
 some Whole Foods
Market Regions and Kroger.

Supermarkets
particularly supermarket chains and prominent local/regional chains
 often impose slotting fees in order to gain shelf presence
within their stores. These fees can be structured to be paid one-time only or in installments. We utilize selective slotting in
supermarket chains throughout the US and to a lesser degree
 in Canada. However
 our local and national sales team has been able
to place our products without having to pay significant slotting fees. Slotting fees for new item placements on average have cost
anywhere between $10 to $150 per store
 per new item.

Food
Service Placement

We
also market our beverages to industrial cafeterias (corporate feeders)
 and to on premise bars and restaurants. As our business
continues to mature
 we intend to place our beverages in stadiums
 sport arenas
 concert halls
 theatres
 and other cultural centers
as long-term marketing and pouring relationships are developed within this business segment.

International
Sales

We
have developed a limited market for our products in Canada
 Europe and Asia. Sales outside of North America currently represent
less than 1% of our total sales. Sales in Canada represent about 1.3% of our total sales. We believe that there are good opportunities
for expansion of sales in Canada and we are increasing our marketing focus on that market. Other international sales become cost
prohibitive
 except in specialty sales circumstances
 since our premium sodas are packed in glass
 which involves substantial
freight to move overseas. We are open to opportunities to export and to copack internationally and expand our brands into foreign
markets
 and we are holding preliminary discussions with trading companies and import/export companies for the distribution of
our products throughout Asia
 Europe and South America. We believe that these areas are a natural fit for Reed&rsquo;s ginger
products
 because of the importance of ginger in international markets
 especially the Asian market where ginger is a significant
part of diet and nutrition.

Distribution
Sales and Marketing

We
currently have a national network of mainstream
 natural and specialty food distributors in the United States and Canada. We sell
directly to our distributors
 who in turn sell to retail stores. We also use our own internal sales force and independent sales
representatives to promote our products for our distributors and direct sales to our retail customers. One of the main goals of
our sales and marketing efforts is to increase sales and grow our brands. Our sales force consists of senior sales representatives
in five geographic regions across the country. Additionally
 we employ a staff of internal telemarketing sales representatives.
Generally
 our sales managers are responsible for all activities related to the sales
 distribution and marketing of our brands
to our entire distributor and retail partner network in North America. We distribute our products primarily through several national
natural foods distributors and an increasing number of regional mainstream DSD distributors. We have entered into agreements with
some of our distributors that commit us to &ldquo;termination fees&rdquo; if we terminate our agreements early or without cause.
These agreements call for our customer to have the right to distribute our products to a defined type of retailer within a defined
geographic region. As is customary in the beverage industry
 if we should terminate the agreement or not automatically renew the
agreement
 we would be obligated to make certain payments to our customers. We have no plans to terminate or not renew any agreement
with any of our customers. We also offer our products and promotional merchandise directly to consumers via the Internet through
our website
 


    
    


Marketing
to Distributors

We
market to distributors using a number of marketing strategies
 including direct solicitation
 telemarketing
 trade advertising
and trade show exhibition. These distributors include natural food
 gourmet food and mainstream distributors. Our distributors
sell our products directly to natural food
 gourmet food and mainstream supermarkets for sale to the public. We maintain direct
contact with our distributor partners through our in-house sales managers. From time to time and in very limited markets
 when
use of our own sales force is not cost effective
 we will utilize independent sales brokers and outside representatives.

Marketing
to Retail Stores

The
primary focus of our sales efforts is supermarket sales. We have a small highly trained sales force that is directly contacting
supermarket chains and setting up promotional calendars. In addition
 we market to retail stores by utilizing trade shows
 trade
advertising
 telemarketing
 direct mail pieces and direct contact with the store. Our sales managers and representatives visit
these retail stores to sell directly in many regions. Sales to retail stores are coordinated through our distribution network
and our regional warehouses.



The
beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing
 packaging
 development of new products
and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of
manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad
 well-established national recognition for years
 through well-funded ad
and other branding campaigns. In addition
 the companies manufacturing these products generally have greater financial
 marketing
and distribution resources than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor
of products
 trade and consumer promotions
 rapid and effective development of new
 unique cutting edge products
 attractive and
different packaging
 branded product advertising and pricing. We also compete for distributors who will concentrate on marketing
our products over those of our competitors
 provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail
outlets. Competitive pressures in the soft drink category could cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market share
or we could experience price erosion. We believe that our all natural innovative beverage recipes
 packaging
 use of premium ingredients
and a trade secret brewing process provide us with a competitive advantage and that our commitments to the highest quality standards
and brand innovation are keys to our success.

The
Kombucha market is dominated by one producer who sells their products nationally. The remainder of the producers is comprised
of mostly fragmented regional or local companies. There are companies that gain market share in certain regions; however
 most
do not have the scale and capability to effectively sell and distribute on a national basis. We believe that Reed&rsquo;s is now
the #2 national producer of Kombucha
 an accomplishment achieved in a relatively short period of time
 by leveraging our existing
distribution channels and customer relationships to expand our sales volume quickly. We also have in-house production capabilities
that can be scaled up as needed to make this a primary brand for Reed&rsquo;s. We believe that our existing infrastructure creates
a competitive advantage
 including product design
 manufacturing &amp; production and a network of sales &amp; distribution.

Proprietary
Rights

We
own trademarks that we consider material to our business. Three of our material trademarks are registered trademarks in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office: Reed&rsquo;s Original Ginger Brew All-Natural Jamaican Style Ginger Ale &reg;
 Virgil&rsquo;s &reg;
and China Cola &reg;. Registrations for trademarks in the United States will last indefinitely as long as we continue to use and
police the trademarks and renew filings with the applicable governmental offices. We have not been challenged in our right to
use any of our material trademarks in the United States. We intend to obtain international registration of certain trademarks
in foreign jurisdictions.

In
addition
 we consider our finished product and concentrate formulae
 which are not the subject of any patents
 to be trade secrets.
Our brewing process is a trade secret. This process can be used to brew flavors of beverages other than ginger ale and ginger
beer
 such as root beer
 cream soda
 cola and other spice and fruit beverages. We have not sought any patents on our brewing processes
because we would be required to disclose our brewing process in patent applications.

We
generally use non-disclosure agreements with employees and distributors to protect our proprietary rights.


    
    


Government
Regulation

The
production
 distribution and sale in the United States of many of our Company&rsquo;s products are subject to the Federal Food
Drug
 and Cosmetic Act
 the Federal Trade Commission Act
 the Lanham Act
 state consumer protection laws
 federal
 state and local
workplace health and safety laws
 various federal
 state and local environmental protection laws and various other federal
 state
and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production
 transportation
 sale
 safety
 advertising
 labeling and ingredients
of such products. Outside the United States
 the distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject
to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.

A
California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having
been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide
warnings on their products. This is because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning
is not required. Consequently
 even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning
labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal
water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. No Company beverages produced for sale in California are currently
required to display warnings under this law. We are unable to predict whether a component found in a Company product might be
added to the California list in the future
 although the state has initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine will be evaluated
for listing. Furthermore
 we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that
may become applicable under this law and related regulations as they currently exist
 or as they may be amended
 might result
in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in a beverage of ours produced for sale in California.

Bottlers
of our beverage products presently offer and use nonrefillable
 recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets
around the world. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers
 which are also recyclable. Legal requirements
apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for
the sale
 marketing and use of certain nonrefillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary.
Other types of beverage container-related deposit
 recycling
 tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply
in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate that additional
 similar legal requirements may be proposed
or enacted in the future at local
 state and federal levels
 both in the United States and elsewhere.

All
of our facilities and other operations in the United States are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations
including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such
legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had
 and we do not expect such compliance to have
 any material adverse
effect on our capital expenditures
 net income or competitive position.

Environmental
Matters

Our
primary cost environmental compliance activity is in recycling fees and redemption values. We are required to collect redemption
values from our customers and remit those redemption values to the state
 based upon the number of bottles of certain products
sold in that state.



We
full-time employees on our corporate staff
 as follows: 2 in general management
 20 in sales and marketing
support
 and 10 in accounting
 administration and operations. We also have 50 production employees that work both full and part
time. We employ additional people on a part-time basis as needed. We have never participated in a collective bargaining agreement.
We believe that the relationship with our employees is good.

Item
2. Property

We
lease a facility of approximately 76
000 square feet
 which serves as our principal executive offices
 our West Coast Brewery
and bottling plant and our Southern California warehouse facility. Approximately 30
000 square feet of the total space is leased
under a long-term lease expiring in 2024. We also lease a warehouse of approximately 18
000 square feet under a lease expiring
in 2017
 a warehouse of approximately 13
000 square feet under a lease expiring in 2017
 and a warehouse of 15
000 square feet
on a month-to-month basis.

Item
3.

From
time to time
 we are a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management evaluates
our exposure to these claims and proceedings individually and in the aggregate and provides for potential losses on such litigation
if the amount of the loss is estimable and the loss is probable.

 there were approximately 157 stockholders of record of the common stock (not including the number of persons
or entities holding stock in nominee or street name through various brokerage firms) and 13
068

stock.

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities

During
the fiscal year ended December 31

 we issued the following equity securities that were unregistered under the Securities
Act:



    
    
We
    issued 2
808 shares of common stock in exchange for consulting services. The value of the stock was based on the closing price
    of the stock on the issuance or agreed upon date. The total value of shares issued for services was $13
000 the shares were
    issued pursuant to exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.


Dividend
Policy

We
have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings
 if any
 for use in our
business
 and
 therefore
 we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Payments of future
dividends
 if any
 will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors
 including the
terms of our credit facility and our financial condition
 operating results
 current and anticipated cash needs and plans for
expansion.

We
are obligated to pay a non-cumulative 5% dividend from lawfully available assets to the holders of our Series A preferred stock
and $0.13 per share per quarter on our Series B preferred stock in either cash or additional shares of common stock at our discretion.
In 2014 and 2013
 we paid dividends on our Series A preferred stock in an aggregate of 1
057 and 1
064 shares of common stock
in each such year
 respectively and anticipate that we will be obligated to issue at least this many shares annually to the holders
of the Series A preferred stock so long as such shares are issued and outstanding. In 2013
 we no longer accrued dividends on
our outstanding Series B shares and paid $74
000 of dividends by issuing 3
394 shares of our common stock

Securities
Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
2001
Stock Option Plan and 2007 Stock Option Plan

We
are authorized to issue options to purchase up to 500
000 shares of common stock under our 2001 Stock Option Plan
 and we are
authorized to issue options to purchase up to 1
500
000 shares of common stock under our 2007 Stock Option Plan. On August 28
2001
 our board of directors adopted the 2001 Stock Option Plan
 and the plan was approved by our stockholders. On October 8
2007
 our board of directors adopted the 2007 Stock Option Plan
 and the plan was approved by our stockholders on November 19
2007.


    
    


The
plans permit the grant of options to our employees
 directors and consultants. The options may constitute either &ldquo;incentive
stock options&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or &ldquo;non-qualified stock options&rdquo;.
The primary difference between &ldquo;incentive stock options&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-qualified stock options&rdquo; is that once
an option is exercised
 the stock received under an &ldquo;incentive stock option&rdquo; has the potential of being taxed at the
more favorable long-term capital gains rate
 while stock received by exercising a &ldquo;non-qualified stock option&rdquo; is
taxed according to the ordinary income tax rate schedule.

The
plans are currently administered by the board of directors. The plan administrator has full and final authority to select the
individuals to receive options and to grant such options as well as a wide degree of flexibility in determining the terms and
conditions of options
 including vesting provisions.

The
exercise price of an option granted under the plan cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of common stock
on the date of the grant of the option. The exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a person owning more than 10%
of the total combined voting power of the common stock must be at least 110% of the fair market value per share of common stock
on the date of the grant. Options may not be granted under the plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the plan.
Incentive stock options granted to a person owning more than 10% of the combined voting power of the common stock cannot be exercisable
for more than five years.

When
an option is exercised
 the purchase price of the underlying stock will be paid in cash
 except that the plan administrator may
permit the exercise price to be paid in any combination of cash
 shares of stock having a fair market value equal to the exercise
price
 or as otherwise determined by the plan administrator.

If
an optionee ceases to be an employee
 director
 or consultant with us
 other than by reason of death
 disability or retirement
all vested options must be exercised within three months following such event. However
 if an optionee&rsquo;s employment or consulting
relationship with us terminates for cause
 or if a director of ours is removed for cause
 all unexercised options will terminate
immediately. If an optionee ceases to be an employee or director of
 or a consultant to us
 by reason of death
 disability
 or
retirement
 all vested options may be exercised within one year following such event or such shorter period as is otherwise provided
in the related agreement.

When
a stock award expires or is terminated before it is exercised
 the shares set aside for that award are returned to the pool of
shares available for future awards.

No
option can be granted under the plan after ten years following the earlier of the date the plan was adopted by the board of directors
or the date the plan was approved by our stockholders.

2010
Incentive Stock Plan and 2010-2 Incentive Stock Plan

We
are authorized to issue up to an aggregate of 75
employees
 officers
 directors
 consultants
independent contractors
 advisors or other service providers to Reed&rsquo;s under our 2010 Incentive Stock Plan and 2010-2 Incentive
Stock Plan (collectively
 the &ldquo;2010 Plans&rdquo;). The 2010 Incentive Stock Plan was adopted by our board of directors on
March 31
 2010; the 2010-2 Incentive Stock Option Plan was adopted on May 5
 2010. The 2010 Plans are administered by a committee
of the board of directors. The plan committee may from time to time
 and subject to the provisions of the plan and such other
terms and conditions as the plan committee may prescribe
 grant to any eligible person one or more shares of common stock of Reed&rsquo;s
(&ldquo;Award Shares&rdquo;). The grant of Award Shares or grant of the right to receive Award Shares shall be evidenced by either
a written consulting agreement or a separate written agreement confirming such grant
 executed by Reed&rsquo;s and the recipient
stating the number of Award Shares granted and stating all terms and conditions of such grant. During 2013
 no shares of common
stock were issued under the 2010 Plans
 and in 2012 there were 14
965 shares of common stock issued under the 2010 Plans.

(a)
Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance
 including sales performance
of particular products
 salesperson performance
 product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross
sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items
 which can mask certain performance issues.
We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales
is not a measure that is recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles &ldquo;GAAP&rdquo; and should not be considered
as an alternative to net sales
 which is determined in accordance with GAAP
 and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating
performance in place of net sales. Additionally
 gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
companies
 as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition
 gross sales may not be realized in
the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.

(b)
Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements
 the disclosure
thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally
 our definition of promotional and other allowances
may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration
given to the Company&rsquo;s distributors or retail customers including
 but not limited to the following: (i) reimbursements
given to the Company&rsquo;s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers
 including slotting
 shelf
space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (ii) the Company&rsquo;s agreed share of fees given to distributors
and/or directly to retailers for in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iii) the Company&rsquo;s agreed share of slotting
shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (iv) incentives given to the Company&rsquo;s distributors and/or
retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; and (v) discounted or free products. The presentation
of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending
levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing
activities. The Company&rsquo;s promotional allowance programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through
separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements
described above and are of varying durations
 ranging from one week to one year.


    
    


(c)
Cost of tangible goods sold consists of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture of products
 co-packing
fees
 repacking fees
 in-bound freight charges
 inventory adjustments
 as well as certain internal transfer costs. Cost of tangible
goods sold is used internally by management to measure the direct costs of goods sold
 aside from unallocated plant costs. Cost
of tangible goods sold is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cost of

 which is determined in accordance with GAAP
 and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance

(d)
Cost of goods sold &ndash; idle capacity consists of direct production costs in excess of charges allocated to our finished goods
in production. Plant costs include labor costs
 production supplies
 repairs and maintenance
 and inventory write-off. Our charges
for labor and overhead allocated to our finished goods are determined on a market cost basis
 which is lower than our actual costs
incurred. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the period incurred rather than added to the cost of
finished goods produced. Cost goods sold &ndash; idle capacity is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be

Year
ended December 31
 2014 Compared to Year ended December 31
 2013

Gross
Sales

Gross
sales of $48
061
000 for the year ended December 31
 2014 represented an increase of 14% from $42
242
000 in the prior year due
to strong same store sales and new accounts. Sales growth was driven primarily by increased sales of our branded products of approximately
$5
161
000
 or 18%. Kombucha sales began in the 2012 third quarter and have increased to become approximately 12% of our total
net revenues.

Promotional
and other allowances

Promotions
and allowances decreased 6% to $4
639
000 (9% of gross sales) for the year ended December 31
 2014 from $4
961
000 (12% of gross
sales) in the prior year. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in the promotional programs and discounts offered
on our branded products.

Net
Sales

Sales
of $43
422
000 for the year ended December 31
 2014 represented an increase $6
141
000
 or 16%
 from $37
281
000 in the prior
year.

Cost
of Goods Sold

Cost
of goods sold consists of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture of products
 co-packing fees
 repacking
fees
 in-bound freight charges
 inventory adjustments
 as well as certain internal transfer costs. Cost of goods sold also consists
of direct production costs in excess of charges allocated to our finished goods in production. Plant costs include labor costs
production supplies
 and repairs and maintenance. Our charges for labor and overhead allocated to our finished goods are determined
on a market cost basis
 which is lower than our actual costs incurred. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed
in the period incurred rather than added to the cost of finished goods produced.


Our
cost of goods sold increased to $30
416
000 in the year ended December 31
 2014
 an increase of approximately $3
929
000 or 15%
from 2013. The increase was primarily due to net revenue increases of 16%
 an increase in copacking fees per case which was not
passed on to our customers and temporary commodities price increases in the third and fourth quarters.

Gross
Profit


Our
gross profit of $13
006
000 in the year ended December 31
 2014 represents an increase of $2
212
000
 or 20% from 2013. As a percentage
of sales
 our gross profit increased to 30% in 2014 as compared to 29% in 2013. The gross profit percentage increase is also impacted
by a decrease in promotional discount costs. Since such costs are a deduction from sales
 the gross margin percentage is positively
impacted by decreased promotional costs.



    
    


Delivery
and Handling Expenses

Delivery
and handling expenses consist of delivery costs to customers and warehouse costs incurred for handling our finished goods after
production. Delivery and handling costs increased to $4
478
000 in the year ended December 31
 2014 compared to $3
977
000 in
2013. The $501
000 (13%) increase is less than the 14% gross sales increase primarily due to decreased warehouse costs as inventory
levels declined for most of the year

Selling
and marketing expenses

Selling
and marketing expenses consist primarily of direct charges for staff compensation costs
 advertising
 sales promotion
 marketing
and trade shows. Selling and marketing costs increased overall to $4
838
000 (or 11.1% of net sales) in the year ended December
31
 2014 from $4
180
000 (or 11.2% of net sales) in 2013. The $658
000 increase is primarily due to increased advertising costs
of $696
000 including $431
000 for a national cable television advertising campaign in the summer and $289
000 in additional magazine
advertising. Our sales staff increased to 19 members at December 31
 2014
 from 18 at December 31
 2013.

General
and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative expenses include executive
 administrative
 and finance personnel costs as well as professional fees. General
and administrative expenses increased $143
000 to $3
649
000 (or 8.4% of net sales) during the year ended December 31
 2014 from
$3
506
000 (or 9.4% of net sales) in 2013. This decrease in the spending rate is attributable to increased efficiencies due to
scale. Salaries and wages decreased by $27
000
 bank audit fees declined $102
000 while professional
 legal and public relations
consulting costs increased by $157
000.

(Loss)
from Operations


from
operations was $41
000 in the year ended December 31
 2014
 as compared to a loss from operations of $869
000 in 2013. The decrease
in the operating loss is due to increased net sales
 decreased promotional spending
 improved production resulting in decreased
Idle Capacity Costs and decreases in Freight Costs
 Selling and Marketing Costs and General and Administrative costs as a percentage
of net sales.

Interest
Expense

Interest
expense increased to $793
000 in the year ended December 31
 2014
 compared to interest expense of $651
000 in the same period
of 2013. The company paid $40
000 in loan fees while negotiating new loan options and incurred additional interest for new leases
and loan balances. However the new PMC loans have substantially lower interest rates (9% vs. 13% effective rate). The new leases
and loans were obtained in order to obtain new machinery and equipment to improve plant operations.

Modified
EBITDA

The
Company defines modified EBITDA (a non-GAAP measurement) as net income (loss) before interest
 taxes
 depreciation and amortization
and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Other companies may calculate modified EBITDA differently. Management believes
that the presentation of modified EBITDA provides a measure of performance that approximates cash flow before interest expense
and is meaningful to investors.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources


As
of December 31
 2014
 we had stockholders equity of $3
652
000 and working capital of $2
207
000
 compared to stockholders equity
of $3
387
000 and working capital of $1
347
000 at December 31
 2013. The increase in our working capital of $860
000 was primarily
a result of cash flow from operations.

Our
decrease in cash and cash equivalents to $959
000 at December 31
 2014 compared to $1
163
000 at December 31
 2013
 a decrease
of $145
000
 was primarily a result of cash generated by operating activities of $1
016
000
 costs of plant improvements of $330
000
and net financing activities of $831
000 primarily due to increased borrowing for plant expansion less pay downs on the revolving
line of credit.

Effective
December 5
 2014
 the Company renewed and extended its Loan and Security Agreement with PMC Financial Services Group
 LLC
 (PMC)
originally dated November 9
 2011 (as amended
 the &ldquo;Amended Agreement&rdquo;). The Amended Agreement extends and amends
the Revolving Loan and Term Loan and adds a new Capital Expansion Loan (the &ldquo;Capex Loan&rdquo;).

The
loans have been extended to December 5
 2016 and are subject to a 1% prepayment penalty for prepayment prior to the first anniversary
of the effective date. As of the effective date of the Amended Agreement
 all three loans have an effective interest rate of 9%.

The
Revolving Loan&rsquo;s maximum revolver amount has been increased to $6
000
000 and the borrowing is based on 85% of Accounts
Receivable and 60% of eligible inventory and is secured by substantially all of the Company&rsquo;s assets. The interest rate
on the Revolving Loan is the prime rate plus .35%. The previous interest rate was the prime rate plus 3.75%. The amended monthly
management fee is .45% of the average monthly loan balance; the previous fee was .5% of the average monthly loan balance. Therefore
the effective interest rate was lowered from 13% to 9%. The over advance of $500
000 on the revolving line of credit calculation
was removed. As of December 31
 2014
 the total Revolving Loan outstanding balance was $3
009
000 and the borrowing availability
was $1
042
000.

The
Term Loan&rsquo;s outstanding principal balance was increased to $1
500
000 and the annual interest rate has been revised to prime
plus 5.75% (currently 9%). The outstanding principal loan balance at the time of the amendment was $496
572 and the previous interest
rate was the prime rate plus 11.6% but not less than 14.85%. The monthly Term Loan payments will be interest only payments over
the 2 year life of the loan.

The
new Capex Loan will finance up to $3
000
000 in new asset purchases for modernization and improvement of the beverage bottling
equipment in Los Angeles plant. The Company will pay a 1.5% fee on new asset purchases and the annual interest rate is equal to
the prime rate plus 5.75%. At December 31
 2014
 the Capex loan balance was $672
000.

The
new loan and security agreement documents were signed December 10
 2014.

The
revolving line of credit agreement included a financial covenant (debt service coverage ratio) that is effective only if the credit
availability under the revolving line of credit falls below $100
000 and another financial covenant (capital expenditures) that
the Company will not make capital expenditures in excess of $500
000 in any fiscal year. At December 31
 2013
 the credit availability
on the revolving line of credit fell below $100
000 and
 during 2014; the Company expended more than $500
000 for capital expenditures.
Accordingly
 these two events caused the Company to be in default under the loan agreement on December 31
 2013. These defaults
were waived on March 19

 2014
 the Company and PMC executed an amendment to the loan that removed
substantially all loan covenants.

We
believe that the Company currently has the necessary working capital to support existing operations for at least the next 12 months.
Our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from operations. If our sales goals do not materialize as planned
 we believe
that the Company can reduce its operating costs and can be managed to maintain positive cash flow from operations. Historically
we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of common stock
 preferred stock
 convertible debt
 a line of
credit from a financial institution and cash generated from operations.

We
may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve profitable operations. If we are not able to
achieve profitable operations at some point in the future
 we eventually may have insufficient working capital to maintain our
operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion and marketing and product development plans. In addition
our losses may increase in the future as we expand our manufacturing capabilities and fund our marketing plans and product development.
These losses
 among other things
 have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital
 total assets and
stockholders&rsquo; equity. If we are unable to achieve profitability
 the market value of our common stock would decline and
there would be a material adverse effect on our financial condition.


    
    


If
we suffer losses from operations
 our working capital may be insufficient to support our ability to expand our business operations
as rapidly as we would deem necessary at any time
 unless we are able to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms
 or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available
on acceptable terms
 we may not be able to pursue our business objectives and would be required to reduce our level of operations
including reducing infrastructure
 promotions
 personnel and other operating expenses. These events could adversely affect our
business
 results of operations and financial condition. If adequate funds are not available or if they are not available on acceptable
terms
 our ability to fund the growth of our operations
 take advantage of opportunities
 develop products or services or otherwise
respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
or GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements including
various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories
 the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks
and trademark licenses
 as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the
normal course of business. The following summarize our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices:

Revenue
Recognition
 and collection
of the receivable is reasonably assured
 which generally occurs when the product is shipped. A product is not shipped without
an order from the customer and credit acceptance procedures performed. The allowance for returns is regularly reviewed and adjusted
by management based on historical trends of returned items. Amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling costs are included
in sales. The Company reimburses its wholesalers and retailers for promotional discounts
 samples and certain advertising and
promotional activities used in the promotion of the Company&rsquo;s products. The accounting treatment for the reimbursements
for samples and discounts to wholesalers results in a reduction in the net revenue line item. Reimbursements to wholesalers and
retailers for certain advertising activities are included in selling and marketing expenses.


Long-Lived
Assets
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment
 management prepares an estimate of future
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying
amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended
December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company did not recognize any impairments for its property and equipment.

Intangible
assets are comprised of indefinite-lived brand names acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate
that these brand names will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized
 but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is
appropriate. As part of our impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not
that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of
our indefinite-lived intangible asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds
its fair value
 as determined by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
For the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company did not recognize any impairment charges for its indefinite-lived
intangible assets.

Management
believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of our long lived assets
 including our trademark license and trademarks
is a &ldquo;critical accounting estimate&rdquo; because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because
it requires management to estimate fair value
 which is based on assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the
impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet
 as well as net income
 could be
material. Management&rsquo;s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues
and expenses have fluctuated in the past and we expect they will continue to do so.


    
    


In
estimating future revenues
 we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data for existing
product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows.

Accounts
Receivable
where we become aware of a specific customer&rsquo;s inability to meet its financial obligations to us
 a specific reserve for
bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount our management believes will
ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded
based on our historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.

.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value
of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned and production
requirements. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated
changes in consumer preferences
 general market conditions or other factors
 which may result in cancellations of advance orders
or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers. Additionally
 our management&rsquo;s estimates of future product demand
may be inaccurate
 which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.

Stock-Based
Compensation. 
transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting
to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value
of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and
warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value
of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment
is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based
compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where
there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee
 option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based
compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.

The
fair value of the Company&rsquo;s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing
model
 which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock options
or warrants
 and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes Option
Pricing model
 and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially
affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

We
believe there have been no significant changes
 during the year ended December 31
 2013
 to the items disclosed as critical accounting
policies and estimates in Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31
 2012.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements


In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09)
 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under
current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require
that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also
will require additional disclosure about the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
contracts
 including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill
a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is not permitted.
Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has not determined the effect of the standard on
our ongoing financial reporting.

In
August 2014
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15)
 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-10). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management&rsquo;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is
substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period
 an entity&rsquo;s management should
evaluate whether there are conditions or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one
year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management&rsquo;s evaluation should
be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are
issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that
it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the
financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December
15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company&rsquo;s financial statement presentation and disclosures.

In
January 2015
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) - Income Statement - Extraordinary
and Unusual Items. ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP. As a result
 an entity will no longer
be required to segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations
 to separately present an extraordinary item
on its income statement
 net of tax
 after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share
data applicable to an extraordinary item. However
 ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for
items that are unusual in nature and occur infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December 15
 2015.
The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.
Early adoption is permitted.

In
February
 2015
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-02
 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation
Analysis. ASU 2015-02 provides guidance on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate
whether they should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships
 limited liability corporations
 and securitization
structures (collateralized debt obligations
 collateralized loan obligations
 and mortgage-backed security transactions). ASU
2015-02 is effective for periods beginning after December 15
 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material
effect on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.

Other
recent accounting pronouncements were issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force)
 the AICPA
 and the Securities
Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;)
 however such pronouncements are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company&rsquo;s present or future financial statements.

equity
 and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.


 the financial statements referred
to above present fairly in all material respects
 the financial position of Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc. as of December 31
 2014 and 2013

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR
THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31
 2014 AND 2013



    
Operations
    and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




    
    
Nature of
    Operations


Reed&rsquo;s
Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was organized under the laws of the state of Florida in January 1991. In 2001
 the Company changed
its name from Original Beverage Corporation to Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc. and changed its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware.
The Company is engaged primarily in the business of developing
 manufacturing and marketing natural non-alcoholic beverages
 as
well as candies and ice creams. We currently manufacture
 market and sell seven unique product lines:



    
    
Reed&rsquo;s Ginger
    Brews


    
    
    

    
    
Virgil&rsquo;s
    Root Beer
 Cream Sodas
 Dr. Better and Real Cola
 including ZERO diet sodas


    
    
    

    
    
Culture Club Kombucha


    
    
    

    
    
China Colas


    
    
    

    
    
Reed&rsquo;s Ginger
    Chews
 

    
    
    

    
    
Reed&rsquo;s Ginger
    Ice Creams


    
    
    

    
    
Sonoma Sparkler
    Sparkling Juices


The
Company sells its products primarily in natural food stores
 supermarket chains
 and upscale gourmet stores in the United States
and Canada.



    
    
    


The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts
inventory obsolescence
 depreciable lives of property and equipment
 analysis of impairments of recorded intangibles
 accruals
for potential liabilities and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.



    
    
Accounts
    Receivable


The
Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the
Company becomes aware of a specific customer&rsquo;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific reserve
for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes
will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded
based on the Company&rsquo;s historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.

The
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts is established through a provision reducing the carrying value of receivables.
At December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts was approximately $253
000 and $324
000
respectively.



    
    
Property
    and Equipment and Related Depreciation


Property
and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of property and
equipment or increase production capacity are capitalized
 and expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets
as follows:




    and Equipment Type
Years
    of Depreciation 

    
39
    years

    
5-12
    years

    
5
    years

    
5-7
    years


Management
assesses the carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment
 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2014 and
2013
 the Company did not recognize any impairment for its property and equipment.


    
    




    
    
Intangible
    Assets and Impairment Policy


Intangible
assets are comprised of indefinite-lived brand names acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate
that these brand names will contribute perpetual cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets
are not amortized
 but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful
life is appropriate. As part of our impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely
than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair
value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible
asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal
to that excess. For the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company did not recognize any impairment charges for its indefinite-lived
intangible assets.



    
    
    


The
Company&rsquo;s cash balances on deposit with banks are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250
000
at December 31
 2014. The Company may be exposed to risk for the amounts of funds held in bank accounts in excess of the insurance
limit. In assessing the risk
 the Company&rsquo;s policy is to maintain cash balances with high quality financial institutions.
The Company had cash balances in excess of the guarantee during the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013.

During
the year ended December 31
 2014
 the Company had&nbsp;two customers who accounted for approximately 33% and 14% of its sales
respectively; and during the year ended December 31
 2013
 the Company had&nbsp;two customers who accounted for approximately
33% and 12% of its sales
 respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in either year. As of December
31
 2014 the Company had accounts receivable due from two customers who comprised $630
000 (25%) and $255
000 (10%) of its total
accounts receivable; and as of December 31
 2013 the Company had accounts receivable due from two customers who comprised $584
000
(27%) and $440
000 (21%)
 respectively
 of its total accounts receivable.

The
Company currently relies on a single contract packer for a majority of its production and bottling of beverage products. The Company
has different packers available for their production of products. Although there are other packers and the Company has outfitted
their own brewery and bottling plant
 a change in packers may cause a delay in the production process
 which could ultimately
affect operating results.

During
the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company had one vendor which accounted for approximately 27% and 29%
 respectively
of purchases. At December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company had accounts payable due to a vendor who comprised 32% and 21% of its
total accounts payable
 respectively. No other account was in excess of 10% of the balance of accounts payable as of December
31
 2014 and December 31
 2013.



    
    
Fair Value
    of Financial Instruments


The
Company uses various inputs in determining the fair value of its investments and measures these assets on a recurring basis. Financial
assets recorded at fair value in the balance sheets are categorized by the level of objectivity associated with the inputs used
to measure their fair value. Authoritative guidance provided by the FASB defines the following levels directly related to the
amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these financial assets:

Level
1&mdash;Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level
2&mdash;Inputs
 other than the quoted prices in active markets
 that are observable either directly or indirectly.

Level
3&mdash;Unobservable inputs based on the Company&rsquo;s assumptions.

The
carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities
 such as cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 short-term bank
loans
 accounts payable
 notes payable and other payables
 approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments. The carrying values of capital lease obligations and long-term financing obligations approximate their fair values
due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates.



    
    
Cost of
    sales


Cost
of goods sold is comprised of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture of products
 co-packing fees
repacking fees
 in-bound freight charges
 as well as certain internal transfer costs. Additionally
 cost of goods sold consists
of direct production costs in excess of charges allocated to finished goods in production. Plant costs include labor costs
 production
supplies
 repairs and maintenance
 and inventory write-off. Charges for labor and overhead allocated to finished goods are determined
on a market cost basis
 which may be lower than the actual costs incurred. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are
expensed in the period incurred rather than added to the cost of finished goods produced. Expenses not related to the production
of our products are classified as operating expenses.


    
    




    
    
Delivery
    and Handling Expenses


Shipping
and handling costs are comprised of purchasing and receiving costs
 inspection costs
 warehousing costs
 transfer freight costs
and other costs associated with product distribution after manufacture and are included as part of operating expenses.



    
    
    


The
Company uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes that allows recognition and
measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and
liability approach
 deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance
is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to
realize their benefits
 or that future deductibility is uncertain. The Company&rsquo;s policy is to recognize interest and/or
penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.



    
    
Revenue
    Recognition


Revenue
is recognized on the sale of a product when the risk of loss transfers to our customers
 and collection of the receivable is reasonably
assured
 which generally occurs when the product is shipped. A product is not shipped without an order from the customer and credit
acceptance procedures performed. The allowance for returns is regularly reviewed and adjusted by management based on historical
trends of returned items. Amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling costs are included in sales.

The
Company accounts for certain sales incentives for customers
 including slotting fees
 as a reduction of gross sales. These sales
incentives for the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013 approximated $4
199
000 and $4
961
000
 respectively.



    
    
Net Loss
    Per Share


Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net
income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued
 using the treasury
stock method. Potential common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.

For
the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential
dilutive securities would have an anti-dilutive effect. The potentially dilutive securities consisted of the following as of:

Advertising
    Costs


Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling expense in the amount of $649
000 and $120
000

Stock Compensation
    Expense


The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for
services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based
on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value of the award is measured
on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and
vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation
is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at
the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation
charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no
future performance requirements by the non-employee
 option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation
charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.

The
fair value of the Company&rsquo;s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing
model
 which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock options
or warrants
 and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton
Option Pricing model
 and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could
materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.



    
    
Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements 


In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09)
 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under
current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require
that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also
will require additional disclosure about the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
contracts
 including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill
a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is not permitted.
Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has not determined the effect of the standard on
our ongoing financial reporting.

In
August 2014
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15)
 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-10). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management&rsquo;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is
substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period
 an entity&rsquo;s management should
evaluate whether there are conditions or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one
year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management&rsquo;s evaluation should
be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are
issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that
it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the
financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December
15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company&rsquo;s financial statement presentation and disclosures.

In
January 2015
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) - Income Statement - Extraordinary
and Unusual Items. ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP. As a result
 an entity will no longer
be required to segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations
 to separately present an extraordinary item
on its income statement
 net of tax
 after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share
data applicable to an extraordinary item. However
 ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for
items that are unusual in nature and occur infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December 15
 2015.
The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.
Early adoption is permitted.

In
February
 2015
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-02
 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation
Analysis. ASU 2015-02 provides guidance on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate
whether they should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships
 limited liability corporations
 and securitization
structures (collateralized debt obligations
 collateralized loan obligations
 and mortgage-backed security transactions). ASU
2015-02 is effective for periods beginning after December 15
 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material
effect on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.

Other
recent accounting pronouncements were issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force)
 the AICPA
 and the Securities
Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;)
 however such pronouncements are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company&rsquo;s present or future financial statements.

On
November 9
 2011
 the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with PMC Financial Services Group
 LLC (PMC)
 which was
amended and extended for 2 years on December 5
 2014
 provides a $6
000
000 revolving line of credit. The Amended Agreement extends
and amends the Revolving Loan and Term Loan (see Note 7) and adds a new Capital Expansion Loan (the &ldquo;Capex Loan&rdquo;)
(see Note 9). At December 31
 2014 and December 31
 2013
 the aggregate amount outstanding under the line of credit was $3
009
000
and $4
524
000 respectively.

The
loans mature on December 5
 2016 and are subject to a 1% prepayment penalty for prepayment prior to the first anniversary of the
effective date. As of the effective date of the Amended Agreement
 all three loans have an effective interest rate of 9%.


of credit agreement included a financial covenant (debt service coverage ratio) that is effective only if the credit availability
under the revolving line of credit falls below $100
000 and another financial covenant (capital expenditures) that the Company
will not make capital expenditures in excess of $500
000 in any fiscal year. At December 31
 2013
 the credit availability on
the revolving line of credit fell below $100
000 and
 during 2014; the Company expended more than $500
000 for capital expenditures.
Accordingly
 these two events caused the Company to be in default under the loan agreement on December 31
 2013. These defaults
were waived on March 19
 2014. On December 5
 2014
 the Company and PMC executed an amendment to the loan that removed substantially
all loan covenants.

The
revolving line of credit is based on 85% of accounts receivable and 60% of eligible inventory and is secured by substantially
all of the Company&rsquo;s assets. The interest rate on the Revolving Loan is the prime rate plus .35% (9% at December 31
 2014).

 2014
 the Company had
borrowing availability of $1
042
000 under the line of credit agreement.

On
June 15
 2009
 the Company closed escrow on the sale of its two buildings and its brewery equipment and concurrently entered into
a long-term lease agreement for the same property and equipment. In connection with the lease the Company has the option to repurchase
the buildings and brewery equipment from 12 months after the commencement date to the end of the lease term at the greater of
the fair market value or an agreed upon amount. Since the lease contains a buyback provision and other related terms
 the Company
determined it had continuing involvement that did not warrant the recognition of a sale; therefore
 the transaction has been accounted
for as a long-term financing. The proceeds from the sale
 net of transaction costs
 have been recorded as a financing obligation
in the amount of $3
056
000. Monthly payments under the financing agreement are recorded as interest expense and a reduction in
the financing obligation at an implicit rate of 9.9%. The financing obligation was personally guaranteed up to a limit of $150
000
by the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Officer
 Christopher J. Reed.

In
connection with the financing obligation
 the Company issued an aggregate of 400
000 warrants to purchase its common stock at
$1.20 per share for five years. The 400
000 warrants were valued at $752
000 and reflected as a debt discount
 using the Black
Scholes Merton option pricing model. The following assumptions were utilized in valuing the 400
000 warrants: strike price of
$2.10 to $2.25; term of 5 years; volatility of 91.36% to 110.9%; expected dividends 0%; and discount rate of 2.15% to 2.20%. The
400
000 warrants were recorded as valuation discount and are being amortized over 15 years
 the term of the purchase option. Amortization
of valuation discount was $50
000 during both of the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013.

Effective
October 1
 2014
 the Company executed Amendment #1 to the Long-term Financing Obligation. In exchange for a release from the $150
000
personal guarantee by the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Office
 and a release of the brewery equipment which was collateral
for the lease agreement
 the Company issued 200
000 warrants to purchase its common stock for $5.60 per share for five years.
The 200
000 warrants were valued at $584
000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. The following assumptions were
made in valuing the 200
000 warrants; term of 5 years
 volatility of 59.53%
 expected dividends 0% and discount rate of 1.25%.
The warrants value of $584
000 will be amortized over the remaining term of the purchase option.

The
aggregate amount due under the financing obligation at December 31
 2014 and 2013 was $2
673
000 and $2
784
000
 respectively.

In
connection with the Loan and Security Agreement with PMC Financial Services Group
 LLC (see Note 5)
 the Company entered into
a Term Loan. The loan was $750
000 and the interest rate was prime plus 11.6%
 not to be below 14.85% (14.85% at December 31
2013)
 and was secured by all of the unencumbered assets of the Company.

Effective
December 5
 2014 the Term Loan&rsquo;s outstanding principal balance was increased to $1
500
000 and the annual interest rate
was revised to prime plus 5.75% (currently 9%). The outstanding principal loan balance at the time of the amendment was $496
572.
Monthly term loan payments are interest only until the December 16
 2016 maturity date when the principal balance is due.

Each share of Series A Preferred stock can be converted into four shares of Reed&rsquo;s common stock.

The
Series A Preferred shares have a 5% pro-rata annual non-cumulative dividend. The dividend can be paid in cash or
 in the sole
and absolute discretion of our board of directors
 in shares of common stock based on its then fair market value. We cannot declare
or pay any dividend on shares of our securities ranking junior to the preferred stock until the holders of our preferred stock
have received the full non-cumulative dividend to which they are entitled. In addition
 the holders of our preferred stock are
entitled to receive pro rata distributions of dividends on an &ldquo;as converted&rdquo; basis with the holders of our common
stock. During the year ended December 31
 2014 the Company accrued and paid a $5
000 dividend payable to the preferred shareholders
which the board of directors elected to pay through the issuance of 1
057 shares of its common stock. During the year ended December

Except
as provided by law
 the holders of our Series A preferred stock do not have the right to vote on any matters

Stock Options
    and Warrants




    
    
    


In
2001
 the Company adopted the Original Beverage Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan and
 in 2007
 the Company adopted the Reed&rsquo;s
Inc. 2007 Stock Option Plan (the &ldquo;Plans&rdquo;). The options under both plans shall be granted from time to time by the
Compensation Committee. Individuals eligible to receive options include employees of the Company
 consultants to the Company and
directors of the Company. The options shall have a fixed price
 which will not be less than 100% of the fair market value per
share on the grant date. The total number of options authorized is 500
000 and 1
500
000
 respectively for the Original Beverage
Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan and the Reed&rsquo;s Inc. 2007 Stock Option Plan.

During
the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company granted 477
500 and 414
000 options
 respectively
 to purchase the Company&rsquo;s
common stock at a weighted exercise price of $4.73 and $3.99
 respectively
 to employees under the Plans. The aggregate value
of the options vesting
 net of forfeitures
 during the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013 was $396
000 and $327
000
 respectively
and has been reflected as compensation cost. As of December 31
 2014
 the aggregate value of unvested options was $798
000
 which
will be amortized as compensation cost as the options vest
 over 2 to 4 years.

On
June 5
 2014
 the Company repriced 323
000 employee options to an exercise price of $4.60 per share
 which were previously $4.74-$6.70
per share. The total increase in stock compensation expense
 as a result of the repricing was approximately $4
000.


    
    


There
were 216
134 stock options exercised in the year ended December 31
 2014 at exercise prices between $1.14 and $5.70 per share.
The Company received $25
700 for 10
000 of such exercises and allowed cash-less exercise of 206
134 of such options
 issuing 131
362
shares of common stock for a total of 141
362 shares issued relative to stock options during the year ended December 31
 2014.

During
the year ended December 31
 2013 there were 348
332 options exercised at an average price of $1.14. Most of such exercises were
cash-less
 however
 the Company did receive proceeds from certain exercises aggregating $30
000.

The
weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during 2014 and 2013 was $2.03 and $1.97
 respectively. The fair value
of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses the assumptions
noted in the following table. For purposes of determining the expected life of the option
 an average of the estimated holding
period is used. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U. S. Treasury yield
in effect at the time of the grant.

Effective
October 1
 2014
 the Company executed Amendment #1 to the Long-term Financing Obligation (see Note 6). In exchange for a release
from the $150
000 personal guarantee by the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Office
 and a release of the brewery equipment
which was collateral for the lease agreement
 the Company issued 200
000 warrants to purchase its common stock for $5.60 per share
for five years. The 200
000 warrants were valued at $584
000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. The following
assumptions were made in valuing the 200
000 warrants; term of 5 years
 volatility of 59.53%
 expected dividends 0% and discount
rate of 1.25%. The warrants will be amortized over 5 years.

During
the year ended December 31
 2013 there were no warrants granted. During the year ended December 31
 2013 there were 215
290 warrants
exercised at prices between $2.10 per share and $2.77 per share (an average price of $2.45)
 resulting in proceeds to the Company
of $373
000 and 188
635 shares of common stock issued.

As
of December 31
 2014
 the aggregate intrinsic value of $430
000 was calculated as the difference between the market price and
the exercise price of the Company&rsquo;s stock
 which was $5.91 as of December 31
 2014.

The
fair value of each warrant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Expected volatility
is based on the historical volatility of the Company. For purposes of determining the expected life of the warrant
 the full contract
life of the warrant is used. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the warrants is based on the U. S.
Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant.

At
December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company had available Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable
income. The amounts available were approximately $17.8 million and $16.5 million for Federal purposes
 respectively
 and $13.3
million and $12.5 million for state purposes respectively. The Federal carryforward expires in 2033 and the state carryforward
expires in 2018. Given the Company&rsquo;s history of net operating losses
 management has determined that it is more likely than
not that the Company will not be able to realize the tax benefit of the carryforwards. Accordingly
 the Company has not recognized
a deferred tax asset for this benefit.

Effective
January 1
 2007
 the Company adopted FASB guidelines that address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected
to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance
 we may recognize the tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from
such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. This guidance also provides guidance on derecognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income
taxes
 accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. At the date of adoption
 and as of December 31
 2014
and 2013
 the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
 and no adjustment was required at adoption.

The
Company&rsquo;s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. As of December 31
2014 and 2013
 the Company has not accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Additionally
 tax years 2007
through 2014 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.

Upon
the attainment of taxable income by the Company
 management will assess the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit associated
with the use of the carryforwards and&nbsp;will recognize the appropriate deferred tax asset at that time.

Significant
components of the Company&rsquo;s deferred income tax assets are as follows as of:

    and Contingencies


Lease
Commitments

The
Company leases warehouse space under non-cancelable operating leases. Rental expense under these and other operating leases for
the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013 was $203
000 and $196

Other
Commitments

The
Company has entered into contracts with customers with clauses that commit the Company to pay fees if the Company terminates the
agreement early or without cause. The contracts call for the customer to have the right to distribute the Company&rsquo;s products
to a defined type of retailer within a defined geographic region. If the Company should terminate the contract or not automatically
renew the agreements without cause
 amounts would be due to the customer. As of December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company has no
plans to terminate or not renew any agreement with any of their customers; therefore
 no such fees have been accrued in the accompanying
financial statements.



    
    


From
time to time
 we are a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management evaluates
our exposure to these claims and proceedings individually and in the aggregate and provides for potential losses on such litigation
if the amount of the loss is estimable and the loss is probable.


there are no material litigation matters at the current time. Although the results of such litigation matters and claims cannot
be predicted with certainty
 we believe that the final outcome of such claims and proceedings will not have a material adverse
impact on our financial position
 liquidity
 or results of operations.



    
Related Party
    Activity


During
the year ended December 31
 2008
 the Company entered into an agreement for the distribution of its products internationally.
The agreement is between the Company and a company controlled by two brothers of Christopher Reed
 Chief Executive Officer of
the Company. The agreement remains in effect until terminated by either party and requires the Company to pay 10% of the defined
sales of the previous month. During the year ended December 31
 2014
 the Company paid commissions of $1
000
 and during the year
ended December 31
 2013
 the Company paid commissions of $15
000.



    
Subsequent
    Events


On
January 16
 2015
 the Company granted options to employees to purchase 238
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock with
an exercise price of $5.39 per share. The fair value of the options on the date granted was determined to be approximately $658
000
using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.64%; dividend
yield of 0%; volatility of 62.71%; with an expected life of 4.5 years and will be amortized ratably over the vesting period of
4 years.


 2015
Mark Beaton was hired as Chief Operating Officer of Reed&rsquo;s Inc. He will be paid a base annual salary of $175
000 and was
granted 70
000 stock options priced at $6.46. The fair value of the options on the date granted was determined to be approximately
$224
000 using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.64%;
dividend yield of 0%; volatility of 60.12%; with an expected life of 4.5 years and will be amortized ratably over the vesting
period of 4 years.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial
Officer
 we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f).&nbsp;Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31
 2014.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2014 that have
materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance
of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the Company&rsquo;s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness
of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2014. In making this assessment
 we used the

Integrated Framework
 as of December 31
 2014
 the Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting was effective.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting
firm
 pursuant to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that permit us to provide only management&rsquo;s
report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

This
report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act
 or otherwise subject to the liabilities
of that section
 and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company
 whether made before or after the date hereof
regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

Corporate
Governance

We
are committed to having sound corporate governance principles. We believe that such principles are essential to running our business
efficiently and to maintaining our integrity in the marketplace. There have been no changes to the procedures by which stockholders
may recommend nominees to our board of directors.

Director
Qualifications

We
believe that our directors should have the highest professional and personal ethics and values
 consistent with our longstanding
values and standards. They should have broad experience at the policy-making level in business or banking. They should be committed
to enhancing stockholder value and should have sufficient time to carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical
wisdom based on experience. Their service on other boards of public companies should be limited to a number that permits them

Item
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
 and Director Independence

Our
board of directors has adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction
 arrangement or relationship
between Reed&rsquo;s and one of our executive officers
 directors
 director nominees or 5% or greater stockholders (or their immediate
family members)
 each of whom we refer to as a &ldquo;related person
&rdquo; in which such related person has a direct or indirect
material interest.

If
a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction
 arrangement or relationship
 defined as a &ldquo;related party transaction
&rdquo;
the related party must report the proposed related party transaction to our Chief Financial Officer. The policy calls for the
proposed related party transaction to be reviewed and
 if deemed appropriate
 approved by the Nominations and Governance Committee.
Our Nominations and Governance Committee is comprised of Dr. Muffoletto and Mr. Fischman. The board of directors has determined
that all of the members of the Nominations and Governance Committee are independent under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange
Listed Company Manual. If practicable
 the reporting
 review and approval will occur prior to entry into the transaction. If advance
review and approval is not practicable
 the Nominations and Governance Committee will review
 and
 in its discretion
 may ratify
the related party transaction. Any related party transactions that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed annually at a minimum.
The related party transactions listed below were reviewed by the full board of directors. Prior to August 2005
 we did not have
independent directors on our board to review and approve related party transactions. The Nominations and Governance Committee
shall review future related party transactions.

During
the years December 31
 2014 and 2013
 we have participated in the following transactions in which a related person had or will
have a direct or indirect material interest:

Judy
Holloway Reed
 our Secretary and director
 is Christopher J. Reed&rsquo;s spouse.

During
the year ended December 31
 2008
 the Company entered into an agreement for the distribution of its products internationally.
The agreement is between the Company and a company controlled by two brothers of Christopher Reed
 Chief Executive Officer of
the Company. The agreement remains in effect until terminated by either party and requires the Company to pay 10% of the defined
sales of the previous month. During the year ended December 31
 2014
 the Company paid commissions on sales of $15
000
 and during
the year ended December 31
 2013
 the Company paid commissions on sales of $66
000.

As
defined by the SEC
 (i) &ldquo;audit fees&rdquo; are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for the
audit of our annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-K
 or for services that are
normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years;
(ii) &ldquo;audit-related fees&rdquo; are fees for assurance and related services by our principal accountant that are reasonably
related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under &ldquo;audit fees;&rdquo;
(iii) &ldquo;tax fees&rdquo; are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for tax compliance
 tax advice
and tax planning; and (iv) &ldquo;all other fees&rdquo; are fees for products and services provided by our principal accountant
other than the services reported under &ldquo;audit fees
&rdquo; &ldquo;audit-related fees
&rdquo; and &ldquo;tax fees.&rdquo;

Audit
Fees

Services
provided to us by Weinberg with respect to such periods consisted of the audits of our financial statements and limited reviews
of the financial statements included in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Weinberg also provided services with respect to the filing
of our registration statements in 2014 and 2013.

Audit
Related Fees

Weinberg
did not provide any professional services to us with which would relate to &ldquo;audit related fees.&rdquo;



Weinberg
prepared our 2014 and 2013 Federal and state income taxes.

All Other
Fees

Weinberg
did not provide any professional services to us with which would relate to &ldquo;other fees.&rdquo;

Audit
Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

Under
the SEC&rsquo;s rules
 the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent
registered public accounting firm in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors&rsquo; independence. The Commission&rsquo;s
rules specify the types of non-audit services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the
Audit Committee&rsquo;s responsibility for administration of the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm.

Consistent
with the SEC&rsquo;s rules
 the Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve all audit services
and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to us or any of our subsidiaries.
The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee and if it does
 the decisions of that
member must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Accordingly
 100% of audit services and non-audit
services described in this Item 14 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

There
were no hours expended on the principal accountant&rsquo;s engagement to audit the registrant&rsquo;s financial statements for
the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the principal accountant&rsquo;s full-time
permanent employees.

 in the sole and absolute discretion of&#13;our board of directors
 in shares of common stock based on its then fair market value. We cannot declare or pay any dividend on&#13;shares of our securities ranking junior to the preferred stock until the holders of our preferred stock have received the full&#13;non-cumulative dividend to which they are entitled. In addition
 the holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive pro&#13;rata distributions of dividends on an &amp;#147;as converted&amp;#148; basis with the holders of our common stock. During the year ended&#13;December 31
 2014 the Company accrued and paid a $5
000 dividend payable to the preferred shareholders
 which the board of directors&#13;elected to pay through the issuance of 1
057 shares of its common stock. During the year ended December 31
 2013 the Company paid&#13;a $5

 if any
 the holders of our Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive
 prior to the holders&#13;of any of our junior securities
 $10.00 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Thereafter
 all remaining assets shall&#13;be distributed pro rata among all of our security holders. Since June 30

 to redeem&#13;all or any portion of the Series A preferred stock by paying the holders thereof the sum of the original purchase price per share
&#13;which was $10.00

 at the option of the holder
 at any time after issuance and prior to the date such stock is redeemed
 into four&#13;shares of common stock
 subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits
 reverse stock splits

 2014 and&#13;2013
 the Company had available Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income. The amounts&#13;available were approximately $17.8 million and $16.5 million for Federal purposes
 respectively
 and $13.3 million and $12.5 million&#13;for state purposes respectively. The Federal carryforward expires in 2033 and the state carryforward expires in 2018. Given the&#13;Company&amp;#146;s history of net operating losses
 management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will&#13;not be able to realize the tax benefit of the carryforwards. Accordingly

 2007
&#13;the Company adopted FASB guidelines that address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on&#13;a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain&#13;tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
&#13;based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should&#13;be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.&#13;This guidance also provides guidance on derecognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim&#13;periods and requires increased disclosures. At the date of adoption
 and as of December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company did not&#13;have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits

 2014 and 2013
 the Company&#13;has not accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Additionally

 the Financial&#13;Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09)
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#13;ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace&#13;it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue&#13;based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure&#13;about the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts
 including significant&#13;judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective&#13;for reporting periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB&#13;issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15)
 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10).&#13;ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management&amp;#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#146;s&#13;ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements&#13;for each annual and interim reporting period
 an entity&amp;#146;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events
&#13;considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within&#13;one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements&#13;are available to be issued when applicable). Management&amp;#146;s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that&#13;are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements&#13;are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern exists&#13;when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to&#13;meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to&#13;be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15

 the FASB&#13;issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) - Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items. ASU&#13;2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP. As a result
 an entity will no longer be required to segregate&#13;extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations
 to separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement
&#13;net of tax
 after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary&#13;item. However
 ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature and&#13;occur infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December 15

 2009
 the Company&#13;closed escrow on the sale of its two buildings and its brewery equipment and concurrently entered into a long-term lease agreement&#13;for the same property and equipment. In connection with the lease the Company has the option to repurchase the buildings and brewery&#13;equipment from 12 months after the commencement date to the end of the lease term at the greater of the fair market value or an&#13;agreed upon amount. Since the lease contains a buyback provision and other related terms
 the Company determined it had continuing&#13;involvement that did not warrant the recognition of a sale; therefore
 the transaction has been accounted for as a long-term financing.&#13;The proceeds from the sale
 net of transaction costs
 have been recorded as a financing obligation in the amount of $3
056
000.&#13;Monthly payments under the financing agreement are recorded as interest expense and a reduction in the financing obligation at&#13;an implicit rate of 9.9%. The financing obligation was personally guaranteed up to a limit of $150
000 by the principal shareholder&#13;and Chief Executive Officer

 the Company issued an aggregate of 400
000 warrants to purchase its common stock at $1.20 per share for five years.&#13;The 400
000 warrants were valued at $752
000 and reflected as a debt discount
 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model.&#13;The following assumptions were utilized in valuing the 400
000 warrants: strike price of $2.10 to $2.25; term of 5 years; volatility&#13;of 91.36% to 110.9%; expected dividends 0%; and discount rate of 2.15% to 2.20%. The 400
000 warrants were recorded as valuation&#13;discount and are being amortized over 15 years
 the term of the purchase option. Amortization of valuation discount was $50
000&#13;during both of the years ended December 31

 2014
&#13;the Company executed Amendment #1 to the Long-term Financing Obligation. In exchange for a release from the $150
000 personal guarantee&#13;by the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Office
 and a release of the brewery equipment which was collateral for the lease&#13;agreement
 the Company issued 200
000 warrants to purchase its common stock for $5.60 per share for five years. The 200
000 warrants&#13;were valued at $584
000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. The following assumptions were made in valuing the&#13;200
000 warrants; term of 5 years
 volatility of 59.53%
 expected dividends 0% and discount rate of 1.25%. The warrants value of&#13;$584

 2014 and 2013 was $2

 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#13;ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace&#13;it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue&#13;based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure&#13;about the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts
 including significant&#13;judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective&#13;for reporting periods beginning after December 15

 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10).&#13;ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management&amp;#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#146;s&#13;ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements&#13;for each annual and interim reporting period
 an entity&amp;#146;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events
&#13;considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within&#13;one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements&#13;are available to be issued when applicable). Management&amp;#146;s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that&#13;are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements&#13;are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#146;s ability to continue as a going concern exists&#13;when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to&#13;meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to&#13;be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15

 an entity will no longer be required to segregate&#13;extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations
 to separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement
&#13;net of tax
 after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary&#13;item. However
 ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature and&#13;occur infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December 15

 in 2007
 the Company adopted the Reed&amp;#146;s Inc. 2007 Stock Option&#13;Plan (the &amp;#147;Plans&amp;#148;). The options under both plans shall be granted from time to time by the Compensation Committee.&#13;Individuals eligible to receive options include employees of the Company
 consultants to the Company and directors of the Company.&#13;The options shall have a fixed price
 which will not be less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the grant date. The&#13;total number of options authorized is 500
000 and 1
500

 2014 and 2013
 the Company granted 477
500 and 414
000 options
 respectively
 to purchase the Company&amp;#146;s common stock&#13;at a weighted exercise price of $4.73 and $3.99
 respectively
 to employees under the Plans. The aggregate value of the options&#13;vesting
 net of forfeitures
 during the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013 was $396
000 and $327
000
 respectively
 and has&#13;been reflected as compensation cost. As of December 31
 2014
 the aggregate value of unvested options was $798
000
 which will&#13;be amortized as compensation cost as the options vest

 2014
 the Company&#13;repriced 323
000 employee options to an exercise price of $4.60 per share
 which were previously $4.74-$6.70 per share. The total&#13;increase in stock compensation expense
 as a result of the repricing was approximately $4

134 stock&#13;options exercised in the year ended December 31
 2014 at exercise prices between $1.14 and $5.70 per share. The Company received&#13;$25
700 for 10
000 of such exercises and allowed cash-less exercise of 206
134 of such options
 issuing 131
362 shares of common&#13;stock for a total of 141
362 shares issued relative to stock options during the year ended December 31

 2013 there were 348
332 options exercised at an average price of $1.14. Most of such exercises were cash-less
 however
 the&#13;Company did receive proceeds from certain exercises aggregating $30

 respectively. The fair value of each option award&#13;is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following&#13;table. For purposes of determining the expected life of the option

 Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;)
was organized under the laws of the state of Florida in January 1991. In 2001
 the Company changed its name from Original Beverage
Corporation to Reed&#146;s
 Inc. and changed its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware. The Company is engaged primarily
in the business of developing
 manufacturing and marketing natural non-alcoholic beverages
 as well as candies and ice creams.
We currently manufacture
 market and sell seven unique product lines:

statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciable
lives of property and equipment
 analysis of impairments of recorded intangibles
 accruals for potential liabilities and assumptions
made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.



    
    
    



collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware
of a specific customer&#146;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific reserve for bad debts is
estimated and recorded
 which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be
collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company&#146;s
historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.


accounts and returns and discounts is established through a provision reducing the carrying value of receivables. At December 31
2014 and 2013
 the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts was approximately $253
000 and $324
000
 respectively.



    
    
    



stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of property and equipment or increase
production capacity are capitalized
 and expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation
is calculated using accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:



    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    



value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If there is indication of impairment
 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized
to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company did not recognize
any impairment for its property and equipment.



    
    
    



of indefinite-lived brand names acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these brand
names will contribute perpetual cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized
but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate.
As part of our impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived
intangible asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible
asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined
by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For the years ended December
31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company did not recognize any impairment charges for its indefinite-lived intangible assets.



    
    
    



balances on deposit with banks are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250
000 at December 31
 2014.
The Company may be exposed to risk for the amounts of funds held in bank accounts in excess of the insurance limit. In assessing
the risk
 the Company&#146;s policy is to maintain cash balances with high quality financial institutions. The Company had cash
balances in excess of the guarantee during the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013.


31
 2014
 the Company had&#160;two customers who accounted for approximately 33% and 14% of its sales
 respectively; and during
the year ended December 31
 2013
 the Company had&#160;two customers who accounted for approximately 33% and 12% of its sales
respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in either year. As of December 31
 2014 the Company had accounts
receivable due from two customers who comprised $630
000 (25%) and $255
000 (10%) of its total accounts receivable; and as of December

on a single contract packer for a majority of its production and bottling of beverage products. The Company has different packers
available for their production of products. Although there are other packers and the Company has outfitted their own brewery and
bottling plant
 a change in packers may cause a delay in the production process
 which could ultimately affect operating results.

inputs in determining the fair value of its investments and measures these assets on a recurring basis. Financial assets recorded
at fair value in the balance sheets are categorized by the level of objectivity associated with the inputs used to measure their
fair value. Authoritative guidance provided by the FASB defines the following levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity
associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these financial assets:

of capital lease obligations and long-term financing obligations approximate their fair values due to the fact that the interest

of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture of products
 co-packing fees
 repacking fees
 in-bound
freight charges
 as well as certain internal transfer costs. Additionally
 cost of goods sold consists of direct production costs
in excess of charges allocated to finished goods in production. Plant costs include labor costs
 production supplies
 repairs and
maintenance
 and inventory write-off. Charges for labor and overhead allocated to finished goods are determined on a market cost
basis
 which may be lower than the actual costs incurred. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the period
incurred rather than added to the cost of finished goods produced. Expenses not related to the production of our products are classified
as operating expenses.

and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes that allows recognition and measurement of deferred
tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach
 deferred
taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets
if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits
 or that future
deductibility is uncertain. The Company&#146;s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters
in income tax expense.

returned items. Amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling costs are included in sales.

share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable
to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares
that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued
 using the treasury stock method. Potential
common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.

 the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential dilutive securities would

issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing
costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance
provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and
recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees
in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement
date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over
the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the
non-employee
 option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the
measurement date.


stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 which uses certain assumptions
related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock options or warrants
 and future dividends.
Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 and based on
actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense
recorded in future periods.



    
    
    



 the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09)
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace
it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue
based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure
about the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts
 including significant
judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is not permitted. Entities can transition to the standard
either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Management is currently assessing the impact
the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has not determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.


 the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15)
 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10).
ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s
ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements
for each annual and interim reporting period
 an entity&#146;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events
considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements
are available to be issued when applicable). Management&#146;s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that
are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements
are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern exists
when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to
meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to
be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods
thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company&#146;s
financial statement presentation and disclosures.


 the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) - Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items. ASU
2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP. As a result
 an entity will no longer be required to segregate
extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations
 to separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement
net of tax
 after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary
item. However
 ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature and
occur infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December 15
 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not
expected to have a material effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.


 2015
 the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-02
 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. ASU
2015-02 provides guidance on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they
should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships
 limited liability corporations
 and securitization structures
(collateralized debt obligations
 collateralized loan obligations
 and mortgage-backed security transactions). ASU 2015-02 is effective
for periods beginning after December 15
 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.


pronouncements were issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force)
 the AICPA
 and the Securities Exchange Commission
(the &#147;SEC&#148;)
 however such pronouncements are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s
present or future financial statements.

 the Company adopted
the Original Beverage Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan and
 in 2007
 the Company adopted the Reed&#146;s Inc. 2007 Stock Option
Plan (the &#147;Plans&#148;). The options under both plans shall be granted from time to time by the Compensation Committee.
Individuals eligible to receive options include employees of the Company
 consultants to the Company and directors of the Company.
The options shall have a fixed price
 which will not be less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the grant date. The
total number of options authorized is 500
000 and 1
500
000
 respectively for the Original Beverage Corporation 2001 Stock Option
Plan and the Reed&#146;s Inc. 2007 Stock Option Plan.


31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company granted 477
500 and 414
000 options
 respectively
 to purchase the Company&#146;s common stock
at a weighted exercise price of $4.73 and $3.99
 respectively
 to employees under the Plans. The aggregate value of the options
vesting
 net of forfeitures
 during the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013 was $396
000 and $327
000
 respectively
 and has
been reflected as compensation cost. As of December 31
 2014
 the aggregate value of unvested options was $798
000
 which will
be amortized as compensation cost as the options vest
 over 2 to 4 years.


 2014
 the Company
repriced 323
000 employee options to an exercise price of $4.60 per share
 which were previously $4.74-$6.70 per share. The total
increase in stock compensation expense
 as a result of the repricing was approximately $4
000.


134 stock
options exercised in the year ended December 31
 2014 at exercise prices between $1.14 and $5.70 per share. The Company received
$25
700 for 10
000 of such exercises and allowed cash-less exercise of 206
134 of such options
 issuing 131
362 shares of common
stock for a total of 141
362 shares issued relative to stock options during the year ended December 31
 2014.


31
 2013 there were 348
332 options exercised at an average price of $1.14. Most of such exercises were cash-less
 however
 the
Company did receive proceeds from certain exercises aggregating $30
000.


date fair value of options granted during 2014 and 2013 was $2.03 and $1.97
 respectively. The fair value of each option award
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following
table. For purposes of determining the expected life of the option
 an average of the estimated holding period is used. The risk-free
rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U. S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant.

 2014 and
2013
 the Company had available Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income. The amounts
available were approximately $17.8 million and $16.5 million for Federal purposes
 respectively
 and $13.3 million and $12.5 million
for state purposes respectively. The Federal carryforward expires in 2033 and the state carryforward expires in 2018. Given the
Company&#146;s history of net operating losses
 management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will
not be able to realize the tax benefit of the carryforwards. Accordingly
 the Company has not recognized a deferred tax asset for
this benefit.


 2007
the Company adopted FASB guidelines that address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on
a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain
tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should
be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
This guidance also provides guidance on derecognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim
periods and requires increased disclosures. At the date of adoption
 and as of December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company did not
have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
 and no adjustment was required at adoption.


is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. As of December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company
has not accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Additionally
 tax years 2007 through 2014 remain open
to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.


income by the Company
 management will assess the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit associated with the use of the carryforwards
and&#160;will recognize a deferred tax asset at that time.

 2009
 the Company
closed escrow on the sale of its two buildings and its brewery equipment and concurrently entered into a long-term lease agreement
for the same property and equipment. In connection with the lease the Company has the option to repurchase the buildings and brewery
equipment from 12 months after the commencement date to the end of the lease term at the greater of the fair market value or an
agreed upon amount. Since the lease contains a buyback provision and other related terms
 the Company determined it had continuing
involvement that did not warrant the recognition of a sale; therefore
 the transaction has been accounted for as a long-term financing.
The proceeds from the sale
 net of transaction costs
 have been recorded as a financing obligation in the amount of $3
056
000.
Monthly payments under the financing agreement are recorded as interest expense and a reduction in the financing obligation at
an implicit rate of 9.9%. The financing obligation was personally guaranteed up to a limit of $150
000 by the principal shareholder
and Chief Executive Officer
 Christopher J. Reed.


obligation
 the Company issued an aggregate of 400
000 warrants to purchase its common stock at $1.20 per share for five years.
The 400
000 warrants were valued at $752
000 and reflected as a debt discount
 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model.
The following assumptions were utilized in valuing the 400
000 warrants: strike price of $2.10 to $2.25; term of 5 years; volatility
of 91.36% to 110.9%; expected dividends 0%; and discount rate of 2.15% to 2.20%. The 400
000 warrants were recorded as valuation
discount and are being amortized over 15 years
 the term of the purchase option. Amortization of valuation discount was $50
000
during both of the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013.


 2014
the Company executed Amendment #1 to the Long-term Financing Obligation. In exchange for a release from the $150
000 personal guarantee
by the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Office
 and a release of the brewery equipment which was collateral for the lease
agreement
 the Company issued 200
000 warrants to purchase its common stock for $5.60 per share for five years. The 200
000 warrants
were valued at $584
000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. The following assumptions were made in valuing the
200
000 warrants; term of 5 years
 volatility of 59.53%
 expected dividends 0% and discount rate of 1.25%. The warrants value of
$584
000 will be amortized over the remaining term of the purchase option.


under the financing obligation at December 31
 2014 and 2013 was $2
673
000 and $2
784
000
 respectively. Aggregate future obligations
under the financing obligation are as follows:

 2011
 the
Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with PMC Financial Services Group
 LLC (PMC)
 which was amended and extended
for 2 years on December 5
 2014
 provides a $6
000
000 revolving line of credit. The Amended Agreement extends and amends the Revolving
Loan and Term Loan (see Note 7) and adds a new Capital Expansion Loan (the &#147;Capex Loan&#148;) (see Note 9). At December
31
 2014 and December 31
 2013
 the aggregate amount outstanding under the line of credit was $3
009
000 and $4
524
000 respectively.

effective date of the Amended Agreement
 all three loans have an effective interest rate of 9%.


agreement included a financial covenant (debt service coverage ratio) that is effective only if the credit availability under the
revolving line of credit falls below $100
000 and another financial covenant (capital expenditures) that the Company will not make
capital expenditures in excess of $500
000 in any fiscal year. At December 31
 2013
 the credit availability on the revolving line
of credit fell below $100
000 and
 during 2014; the Company expended more than $500
000 for capital expenditures. Accordingly
these two events caused the Company to be in default under the loan agreement on December 31
 2013. These defaults were waived
on March 19
 2014. On December 5
 2014
 the Company and PMC executed an amendment to the loan that removed substantially all loan
covenants.


is based on 85% of accounts receivable and 60% of eligible inventory and is secured by substantially all of the Company&#146;s
assets. The interest rate on the Revolving Loan is the prime rate plus .35% (9% at December 31
 2014). The amended monthly management
fee is .45% of the average monthly loan balance. As of December 31
 2014
 the Company had borrowing availability of $1
042
000
under the line of credit agreement.

statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts
 inventory obsolescence
depreciable lives of property and equipment
 analysis of impairments of recorded intangibles
 accruals for potential liabilities
and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.


        
        


    
    
    



collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware
of a specific customer&#146;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific reserve for bad debts is
estimated and recorded
 which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be
collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company&#146;s
historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.


accounts and returns and discounts is established through a provision reducing the carrying value of receivables. At December

 2014 and 2013
 the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts was approximately $253

 respectively.


        
        


    
    
    



stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of property and equipment or increase
production capacity are capitalized
 and expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation
is calculated using accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:



    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    



carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not
be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment
 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an
impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013
the Company did not recognize any impairment for its property and equipment.


        
        


    
    
    



of indefinite-lived brand names acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these brand
names will contribute perpetual cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized
but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate.
As part of our impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived
intangible asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible
asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined
by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For the years ended December
31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company did not recognize any impairment charges for its indefinite-lived intangible assets.


        
        


    
    
    



balances on deposit with banks are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250
000 at December 31
 2014.
The Company may be exposed to risk for the amounts of funds held in bank accounts in excess of the insurance limit. In assessing
the risk
 the Company&#146;s policy is to maintain cash balances with high quality financial institutions. The Company had cash
balances in excess of the guarantee during the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013.

 the Company had&#160;two customers who accounted for approximately 33% and 14% of its sales
 respectively; and during
the year ended December 31
 2013
 the Company had&#160;two customers who accounted for approximately 33% and 12% of its sales
respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in either year. As of December 31
 2014 the Company had accounts
receivable due from two customers who comprised $630

available for their production of products. Although there are other packers and the Company has outfitted their own brewery and

 a change in packers may cause a delay in the production process
 which could ultimately affect operating results.

 2014 and 2013
 the Company had one vendor which accounted for approximately 27% and 29%
 respectively of all purchases. At
December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company had accounts payable due to a vendor who comprised 32% and 21% of its total accounts payable

inputs in determining the fair value of its investments and measures these assets on a recurring basis. Financial assets recorded
at fair value in the balance sheets are categorized by the level of objectivity associated with the inputs used to measure their
fair value. Authoritative guidance provided by the FASB defines the following levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity
associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these financial assets:

values of capital lease obligations and long-term financing obligations approximate their fair values due to the fact that the
interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates.

 as well as certain internal transfer costs. Additionally
 cost of goods sold consists of direct production costs
in excess of charges allocated to finished goods in production. Plant costs include labor costs
 production supplies
 repairs
and maintenance
 and inventory write-off. Charges for labor and overhead allocated to finished goods are determined on a market
cost basis
 which may be lower than the actual costs incurred. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in
the period incurred rather than added to the cost of finished goods produced. Expenses not related to the production of our products
are classified as operating expenses.

and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes that allows recognition and measurement of deferred
tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach
 deferred
taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax
assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits
 or that
future deductibility is uncertain. The Company&#146;s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax
matters in income tax expense.

share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable
to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares
that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued
 using the treasury stock method. Potential
common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.

issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing
costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance
provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and
recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees
in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement
date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over
the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the
non-employee
 option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the
measurement date.


stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 which uses certain assumptions
related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock options or warrants
 and future dividends.
Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 and based on
actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation
expense recorded in future periods.


        
        


    
    
    



 the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09)
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace
it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue
based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure
about the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts
 including significant
judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is not permitted. Entities can transition to the standard
either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Management is currently assessing the impact
the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has not determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.


 the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15)
 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10).
ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s
ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements
for each annual and interim reporting period
 an entity&#146;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events
considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements
are available to be issued when applicable). Management&#146;s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that
are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements
are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern exists
when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to
meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to
be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods
thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company&#146;s
financial statement presentation and disclosures.


 the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) - Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items. ASU
2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP. As a result
 an entity will no longer be required to segregate
extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations
 to separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement
net of tax
 after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary
item. However
 ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature and
occur infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December 15
 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not
expected to have a material effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.


 2015
 the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-02
 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. ASU
2015-02 provides guidance on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they
should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships
 limited liability corporations
 and securitization structures
(collateralized debt obligations
 collateralized loan obligations
 and mortgage-backed security transactions). ASU 2015-02 is effective
for periods beginning after December 15
 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.


pronouncements were issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force)
 the AICPA
 and the Securities Exchange Commission
(the &#147;SEC&#148;)
 however such pronouncements are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s
present or future financial statements.

without cause. The contracts call for the customer to have the right to distribute the Company&#146;s products to a defined type
of retailer within a defined geographic region. If the Company should terminate the contract or not automatically renew the agreements
without cause
 amounts would be due to the customer. As of December 31

 the Company has no plans to terminate or
not renew any agreement with any of their customers; therefore
 no such fees have been accrued in the accompanying financial statements.

 we are
a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management evaluates our exposure to these
claims and proceedings individually and in the aggregate and provides for potential losses on such litigation if the amount of
the loss is estimable and the loss is probable.


no material litigation matters at the current time. Although the results of such litigation matters and claims cannot be predicted
with certainty
 we believe that the final outcome of such claims and proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our
financial position
