 healthy solutions to support the lifestyles of today's active health conscious consumers. We commenced sales of our packaged snack products in the third quarter ended March 31
 2011
 although we made no sales during the twelve months ended June 30
 2015 or 2014. Our principal executive office address is 5042 Wilshire Blvd.
 Los Angeles
Our Company was organized under the laws of the state of California on November 5
 1996 as Renet Services
 Inc. Our name was changed to Time Lending
 California
 Inc. on August 4
 1998 and we reincorporated in the state of Nevada in December
 2000 by merging with Time Lending California
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation. Time Lending California
 Inc. subsequently changed its name to Time Associates
 Inc. Effective as of October 5
 2010
 Time Associates
 Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of September 23
 2010 (the Reorganization Agreement) with Healthient
 Inc. a Nevada corporation organized April 29
 2009 (Healthient) and Healthient shareholders. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Reorganization Agreement
 the Company acquired Healthient in exchange for 43
618
356 newly issued restricted shares of common voting stock of the Company to the Healthient shareholders on a pro rata basis for the purpose of effecting a tax-free reorganization pursuant to sections 351
 354 and 368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. As a condition of the closing of the share exchange transaction
 a majority shareholder of the Company cancelled all of his 188
572 shares. In addition
 as a condition of the closing of the transaction
 the Company spun off its operating subsidiary Time Marketing
 Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Agreement
 each one (1) share of common stock of Healthient has been exchanged for three (3) shares of the Company's common stock. Following the Closing Date
 there were 43
778
433 shares of the Registrant's common stock outstanding. Immediately prior to the Closing
 there were 160
077 shares issued and outstanding (assuming the cancellation of the shares held by the majority shareholder at the closing). The shareholders of Healthient owned 99.6% of the common stock outstanding of the Company after the issuance of the 43
618
356 shares. On November 15
 2010 Time Associates
 Inc. changed its name to Healthient
The acquisition of Healthient by the Company on October 5
 2010 has been accounted for as a purchase and treated as a reverse acquisition and re-capitalization since the former owners of Healthient controlled 99.6% of the total shares of common stock of the Company outstanding immediately following the acquisition. In November 2010 Healthient
 Inc. changed its name to SnackHealthy
 Inc. SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation
 was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On this basis the historical financial statements prior to October 5
 2010 have been restated to be those of the accounting acquirer Healthient
 now SnackHealthy
 Inc. The historical stockholders' equity prior to the reverse acquisition has been retroactively restated (a re-capitalization) for the equivalent number of shares received in the acquisition after giving effect to any difference in par value of the issuer's and acquirer's stock. The original 160
078 shares of common stock outstanding prior to the exchange reorganization have been reflected as an addition in the stockholders' equity account of the Company on October 5
As of October 1
 2012
On October 4
 2013
 the Company changed its name to SnackHealthy, Inc. and dissolved its wholly-owned subsidiary SnackHealthy
 Inc.
As of October 28
 2013
The Board of Directors and the majority shareholders of the Company constituting a total of 9
327
859 shares of common stock (82.83%) approved as of June 26
 2015
 in a written consent of the Board of Directors and the majority of the shareholders of the Company
 a name change from SnackHealthy, Inc. to Amaize Beverage Corporation. The Company believes that its new name will better reflect the new direction of the Company's business
 that of developing and marketing beverages that provide sustenance and benefit to active and health-conscious consumers. The Company seeks to deliver these health benefits as it develops products that are all-natural
 low-calorie and free from artificial sweeteners. On August 13
 2015
 the Company has filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation (the Amendment) with the Secretary of State of the state of Nevada. The Amendment provides for the change of the Company name from SnackHealthy
 Inc. to its current name
Our Company has been primarily engaged in developing our infrastructure and our product portfolio to help people achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle. We commenced sales of two healthy snack products in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and had net revenue of $314
980 for the fiscal year ended June 30
 2012. However
 we generated no sales in the years ended June 30
During 2013
 we began to implement our strategic plan
 which provides for future growth of our existing core brands through a new expanded distribution method
 innovation and advertising. Our primary focus was on decreasing general and administrative costs associated with network marketing and improving sales and profit margins through pricing strategies and enhanced packaging and product configuration. To accomplish this we began the process of winding down the network marketing sales in order to better position the Company to serve retailers and ultimately
To more effectively facilitate the process of shifting to retail distribution
 in November 2013
 Richard Damion joined our Company as the acting chief executive officer. He was then approved by the Board of Directors as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2014. On February 15
 2015
 the Board of Directors of the Company appointed A.R. (Bud) Grandsaert
 age 72
 as the Company's new President. Richard Damion resigned as the Company's President as of that date; however
We determined during the first quarter of 2015 that we would transition out of our lower margin
 perishable snack food product lines and have focused our resources solely on developing our new healthy beverages. Amaize Beverage Corporation will continue to focus on developing its healthy beverage product line with a plan to sell to large retailers and club stores in the United States. The Company recently completed development of a unique better for you beverage with purple corn as its primary ingredient. Purple corn has historical roots of over thousands of years yet is newly rediscovered for its incredible health benefits. Leading research &amp; development companies in the United States have been gathering data on its health benefits and working on integrating its benefits into a number of consumer products. The beverage
 with super antioxidant status
 is a unique blend of fruits and spices
 offering extraordinary health benefits and great taste. Our initial portfolio design includes three beverage lines; Amaize&#8482;100% Natural Purple Corn Beverage
 Amaizing Tea&#8482; and Amaizing Lemonade&#8482;maiziplan to launch our Amaize&#8482; 100% Natural Purple Corn Drink ahead of our blended teas and blended lemonades to establish our distribution network with a one of a kind product and to later
our tea and lemonade beverages through an established distribution system. The fact that the average American drinks over seven drinks per day allows plenty of opportunity to market a healthy drink
While there can be no assurance
 management believes that this strategy will ultimately prove successful. The Company is currently seeking the necessary financing to pursue its business and growth plans
 however
We are a virtual company with a focus on staying lean through the use of cloud based technologies
 maintaining low overhead

According to the World Health Organization (WHO)
 approximately 1.7 billion adults are overweight and 400 million are obese. By 2015
 it is predicted that 2.3 billion adults will be overweight and more than 700 million will be obese. Obesity rates among children have also climbed
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
 over the last 30 years
Studies show that the most effective way to prevent obesity is to address it during childhood by instilling healthy habits which starts with the very basis of cutting back on sugary drinks
 eating the right foods
Our initial portfolio will consist of three beverage lines; Amaize&#8482;100% Natural Purple Corn Beverage
The beneficial properties of Purple Corn are promising. Current research supports
 although it has not been scientifically proven
Amaize is a uniquely delicious drink
 rich is color and high in antioxidants. It is based on an ancient Peruvian drink made by brewing purple corn and adding tropical pineapple juice and apple juice. It offers many potential health benefits. Due to the high concentrations of natural purple pigments known as anthocyanins
 Purple Corn is an antioxidant powerhouse. It protects cells from damage by free radicals
 detoxifies
 is a powerful anti-inflammatory and lowers blood pressure. Because Purple corn's anthocyanins are stable when heated
Amaizing Lemonade is a 100% Natural Lemonade blended with Purple Corn It is a refreshing take on one of America's favorite beverages. We plan to extend the line to five distinct and great tasting flavors
A brief review of the Lemonade market is in order. Lemonade
 that quintessential summertime drink
 is becoming a drink for all seasons.&nbsp;No longer resigned to backyard barbecues and ball games
Somewhere between the pumped-up
 sugar-saturated drinks and the tasteless waters
 there is a need for a healthier alternative in the tea category. Our goal is to provide genuine natural taste without the artificially concocted sweeteners and preservatives designed to compensate for lack of taste. Amaizing Tea will allow people to enjoy the world's second most popular drink the way hundreds of civilizations and nature intended it to be; a world of flavor freshly brewed and barely sweetened. We plan to blend tea from around the world with brewed purple corn with an added hint of honey or pure palm sugar. Finally
Unlike most of the bottled teas in the marketplace
 our formula for Amaizing Tea does not use bricks of tea dust
 tea concentrate
 or other artificial sweeteners or acids. The tea will have no bitter aftertaste or sugar kick
Though it was a long and arduous learning experience finding the perfect way to brew the purple corn and blend it with the appropriate ingredients
 we have developed unique brewing tools and techniques which will enable us to manufacture in an efficient and scalable manner to achieve our desired consistency. We plan to have our Amaize beverage line brewed and bottled at facilities selected based on numerous criteria including capacity
 reputation
 quality control
 production efficiency and willingness to invest in a long-term partnership. The Company is currently seeking the necessary financing to pursue its production and manufacturing plans
 however
Our primary targeted demographics are 30+ adults who want to feel young and lead active
We plan to launch our initial beverage in the first quarter of&nbsp;2016. The launch of our initial beverage is subject to the Company's ability to obtain additional financing. Pre-marketing discussions with distributors are underway and some distributors have expressed interest in adding the Amaize brand to their line-up. We plan to use in-store sampling as a strategy to educate consumers. In addition
 we plan to advertise via consumer websites
 social media outlets and magazines. The Company is currently seeking the necessary financing to pursue its product launch
 however
We plan to position our beverages as both an RTD stand-alone and a natural complement to food in an effort to broaden appeal. We believe we can benefit from the large and growing tea and lemonade markets reflected by the surging sales growth in both categories in North America and internationally. Our beverages
 being all-natural
 lower calorie
 and good for you
 will be in-line with our corporate mission to reach a large demographic by aiming to be the one of the healthiest
We plan to have our line of products offered initially in a 16oz. plastic bottle to be followed up with an 8 oz. individual and a larger 32 oz. Club size. Our bottles
By using contemporary designed bottles with spot labeling
The beauty of our custom bottles are in their simplicity. Our packaging has no flashy slogans
The Company is currently seeking the necessary financing to pursue its packaging plans
 however
The retail price for our 16oz. Amaize&#8482; is expected to be between $2.50 and $2.99
Although carbonated soft drinks still dominate the beverage market
 in the past ten years Ready-To-Drink teas and bottled water have emerged as alternatives. Since 2009 the United States tea market has enjoyed 20% annual growth
Arizona Tea and Snapple have helped make tea accessible to a broader population. Now in the same way that gourmet coffees have become popular
 consumers are beginning to develop an appreciation for finer teas. Over the last six years United States loose leaf tea sales have more than doubled. According to the Tea Council
 there are over a thousand tea houses or tea parlors in the country
 mostly opened within the last two or three years. These parlors focus almost exclusively on tea
 products that go with tea as well as tea hardware. They carry names such as Teaism
 TeaLuxe
 Elixir Tonics and Teas
 and Tea &amp; Company. Even Lipton is opening a flagship tea bar in Pasadena
 California. In addition to the burgeoning of tea cafes
 tea culture is spreading in the form of tea magazines
 tea-flavored ice cream
 frozen tea ice bars
 tea-scented perfume and bubble bath
 tea jelly
 tea calendars and even books about tea. The paperback Loving Tea was recently spotted as a cash register book at the bookstore

In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K
 the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business
 financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties
 including risks that we do not presently know of or currently deem insignificant
 may also impair our business
Recessionary pressures from an overall decline in U.S. economic activity could adversely impact our business and financial results. Economic uncertainty may reduce consumer spending in our sales channels and create a shift in consumer preference toward private label products. Shifts in consumer spending could result in increased pressure from competitors or customers to reduce the prices of some of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices
 which could lower our revenues and profitability. Instability in the financial markets may impact our ability or increase the cost to enter into credit agreements in the future. Additionally
 it may weaken the ability of our customers
 suppliers
 distributors
 banks
 insurance companies and other business partners to perform in the normal course of business
 which could expose us to losses or disrupt the supply of inputs we rely upon to conduct our business. If one or more of our key business partners fail to perform as expected or contracted for any reason
Volatility in the price or availability of the inputs we depend on
 including raw materials
 packaging
 energy and labor
Our financial results could be adversely impacted by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and packaging. Continued growth would require us to hire
 retain and develop a highly skilled workforce and talented management team. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for current positions could erode our competitiveness. In addition
 our financial results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees
Price competition and industry consolidation could adversely impact our financial results. The sales of most of our products are subject to significant competition primarily through discounting and other price cutting techniques by competitors
 many of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition
 there is a continuing consolidation in the beverage and snack food industries
 which could increase competition. Significant competition increases the possibility that we could lose one or more major customers
 lose existing product authorizations at customer locations
 lose market share and/or shelf space
 increase expenditures or reduce selling prices
Sales price increases initiated by us may negatively impact our financial results. Future price increases
 such as those to offset increased ingredient costs
 may reduce our overall sales volume
 which could reduce revenues and operating profit. Additionally
 if market prices for certain ingredients decline significantly below our contracted prices
There are risks associated with our ability to retain key employees. If certain key employees terminate their employment
 it could negatively impact sales
 marketing or development activities. Further
 management's attention might be diverted from operations to recruiting suitable replacements and our financial condition
 results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected. In addition
If we are unsuccessful due to our execution
 unplanned events
 ability to manage change or unfavorable market conditions
 our financial performance could be adversely affected. If we pursue strategic acquisitions
 divestitures
 or joint ventures
We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients. Negative publicity about these concerns
 whether or not valid
If our products become adulterated
 misbranded or mislabeled
Product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our market share and financial results. We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled
Our ability to manufacture
 distribute and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the supply and delivery of key inputs
 such as raw materials
 finished goods
 packaging
 labor and energy
 could impair our ability to conduct our business. Examples include
 but are not limited to
 weather
 natural disasters
 fires
 terrorism
 pandemics and strikes. Certain warehouses and manufacturing facilities may be located in areas prone to tornadoes
 hurricanes and floods. Any business disruption due to natural disasters or catastrophic events in these areas could adversely impact our business and financial results if not adequately mitigated. We also rely on a certain supplier for the manufacturing of one of our core branded products. Although we have secured back-up suppliers in the case of emergency
 any damage or disruption to this supplier's manufacturing or distribution capabilities could impair our ability to sell this product. Also
 we increasingly rely on information technology systems to conduct our business. These systems can enhance efficiency and business processes but also present risks of unauthorized access to our networks or data centers. If unauthorized parties gain access to our systems
 they could obtain and exploit confidential business
 customer
 or employee information and harm our competitive position. Further
 these information systems may experience damage
 failures
 interruptions
 errors
 inefficiencies
 attacks or suffer from fires or natural disasters
Consumers are moving away from traditional means of electronic mail towards new forms of electronic communication
 including social media. We support new ways of sharing data and communicating with customers using methods such as social networking. However
 misuse of social networking by individuals
 customers
 competitors
 or employees may result in unfavorable media attention which could negatively affect our business. Further
We are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenues and profits
 we must sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position. Our success depends on the ability to respond to consumer trends
 including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness
 obesity
 product attributes and ingredients. In addition
 changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors
 including the aging of the general population
 changes in social trends
 changes in travel
 vacation or leisure activity patterns
Our continued success also is dependent on product innovation
 including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products
 and the effectiveness of advertising campaigns
 marketing programs and product packaging. Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal
 there can be no assurance as to the continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products
 or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs. In addition
 both the launch and ongoing success of new products and advertising campaigns are inherently uncertain
 especially as to their appeal to consumers. Further
 failure to successfully launch new products could decrease demand for existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of existing brands
 as well as result in inventory write-offs
 trademark impairments and other costs
Our distribution network relies on relationships with our distributors
 and such reliance could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market products
Our business relies upon a significant number of distribution relationships for the sale and distribution of our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks related to all or any of these factors in any of the current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. To the extent that any of these factors have an adverse effect on the relationships with consultants
 companies or retailers in a particular geographic area and
 thus
 limit our ability to maintain and expand the sales market
We will maintain trademarks and other intellectual property rights
 which are important to our success and competitive position
 and the loss of or our inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business. We will devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis. Efforts to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. In addition
Food and beverage production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal
 state and other governmental agencies. New or increased government regulation of the food and beverage industry
 including but not limited to areas related to product safety
 chemical composition
 production processes
 traceability
 product quality
 packaging
 labeling
 school lunch guidelines
 promotions
 marketing and advertising (particularly such communications that are directed toward children)
 product recalls
 records
 storage and distribution could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing production costs or restricting our methods of operation and distribution. These regulations may address food industry or society factors
 such as obesity
A significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock is controlled by a few individuals
The founder of the Company
 Katherine T. West beneficially owns a majority of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Mrs. West currently serves as the Chairman of the Board. As a result
 she may be able to exercise significant influence over the Company and certain matters requiring approval of its stockholders
 including the approval of significant corporate transactions
 such as a merger or other sale of the Company or its assets. This could limit the ability of other stockholders of the Company to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company. In addition
 Mrs. West may have actual or potential interests that diverge from the interests of the other stockholders of the Company. Sales by Mrs. West
 or other majority shareholders
 of their shares into the public market
 or the perception that such sales could occur
As a publicly traded company
 we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 or the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition
 the Exchange Act requires that we file annual
 quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws
 expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we
 among other things
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements
We are
 and in the future may be
We could incur substantial legal fees and other expenses in connection with legal or administrative matters
We have decided to change our business strategy and as a result of that process which has not been completed yet
 we have virtually no financial resources. Our independent registered auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion on our financial statements as of and for the years ended June 30
 2015 and 2014 that states that Company losses from operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. We will seek additional financing in the future. Financing sought may be in the form of equity or debt financing from various sources as yet unidentified. Most
 if not all of our efforts have been spent on our change of business strategy and developing our new healthy beverage business plan
 however
Our internal controls may be inadequate
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)
 internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors
 management and other personnel
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
Our internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective
Our board of directors has authority
 without action or vote of the shareholders
The trading of our securities is on the OTCBB as maintained by FINRA and the OTCQB as maintained by the OTC Markets Group. As a result
 an investor may find it difficult to dispose of
Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a penny stock, for purposes relevant to us
 as any equity security that has a minimum bid price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
For any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
 the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks
 the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver
 prior to any transaction in a penny stock
 a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market
 which
 in highlight form
 sets forth: the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination
 and that the broker or dealer received a signed
Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stock in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commissions' payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative
 current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Additionally
Because of these regulations
 broker-dealers may not wish to engage in the above-referenced necessary paperwork and disclosures and/or may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock
Because we are not subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures
 our stockholders have limited protection against interested director transactions
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the SEC
 the New York and American Stock Exchanges and the Nasdaq Stock Market
 as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley
 require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than legally required
Because none of our directors (currently two persons) are independent directors
 we do not currently have an independent audit or a compensation committee. As a result
 directors have the ability
 among other things
 to determine their own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures
 regardless of whether such compliance is required
 the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions
 conflicts of interest
 if any
We intend to comply with all corporate governance measures relating to director independence as and when required. However
 we may find it very difficult or be unable to attract and retain qualified officers

In June 2013
 a former officer of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company and its President and directors alleging several counts

The Company has evaluated subsequent events from June 30
 2015 through the date the financial statements were available to be issued and has determined that
 other than as disclosed above
 there have been no subsequent events after June 30
A system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-l5(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
as amended [the Exchange Act]) are controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information that the Company is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management
 including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures
 including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly
 even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives
 and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition
 the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Moreover
 over time
 controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system
 misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company
 and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report
 based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15 (f)
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company. Due to limited resources
 Management conducted an evaluation of internal controls based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The results of this evaluation determined that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of June 30
 2015
 due to material weaknesses. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is defined as a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness
We have not achieved the desired level of documentation of our internal controls and procedures. When the Company obtains sufficient funding
As a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above
 the Company's management has concluded that
 as of June 30
 2015
 the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. To date
 the Company has not been able to establish an Audit Committee with an independent director due its limited financial resources. When the Company obtains sufficient funding

On
October 4
 2013
 Healthient
 Inc. (&#34;the Company&#34;) changed its name to SnackHealthy
 Inc. and dissolved its sole wholly-owned
subsidiary SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation. As of June 26
 2015
 majority of the shareholders of the Company representing
not less than 9
327
859 shares of common stock (82.83%) consented in writing to change the Company's name to Amaize Beverage Corporation.
Such approval and consent constitute the approval and consent of a majority of the total number of shares of outstanding common
stock and are sufficient under the Nevada General Corporation Law and the Company's Bylaws to approve the above action. On August
13
 2015
 Amaize Beverage Corporation
 previously known as SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation filed an amendment to its
articles of incorporation (the &#34;Amendment&#34;) with the Secretary of State of the state of Nevada. The Amendment provided
for the change of the Company's name from SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 Inc. to Amaize Beverage Corporation. The name change and the change
of the Company's trading symbol were subsequently declared effective by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as of August 19
2015.

Amaize Beverage Corporation markets
and distributes organic and all-natural healthy food and beverage products. The Company offers a portfolio of healthy foods and
beverages that are organic
 all-natural
 low-calorie
 and free from artificial sweeteners; created for consumption over several
eating occasions daily. We determined during the first quarter that we would transition out of our lower margin
 perishable snack
food product lines to focus our resources solely on developing our new healthy beverage business.

The financial statements of the
Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are
presented in US dollars. The Company's year-end is June 30.




The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary until its dissolution effective October
4
 2013. All significant inter&#150;company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.




The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.




The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.




Inventory comprises packaged
products ready for final sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined by the first-in
 first-out
method.




The carrying value of the Company&#146;s
financial instruments
 including cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 and amounts due to related
parties
 as reported in the accompanying balance sheets
 approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these financial
instruments.




Property and equipment are stated
at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset
 which is three to seven years.




The Company has adopted the provisions
Costs incurred in the planning state of
websites are expensed
 while costs incurred in the development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated three-year
life of the asset. All website development costs have been fully amortized at June 30
 2015.




Our drink license was amortized
over three years and is fully amortized at June 30
 2015.




In accordance with ASC 350
 the
Company regularly reviews the carrying value of intangible and other long-lived assets for the existence of facts or circumstances
both internally and externally
 that may suggest impairment. If impairment testing indicates a lack of recoverability
 an impairment
loss is recognized by the Company if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.




The Company accounts for income
taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 (&#147;ASC 740-10-25&#148;) Income Taxes. Under ASC 740-10-25
 deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.




Revenue is recognized only when
the price is fixed or determinable
 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 products are shipped
 which is when title and
risk of loss pass to the customer and collectability of the amount is reasonably assured. Specifically
 revenue is recognized
when products are shipped
 which is when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The Company classifies selling discounts
and rebates
 if any
 as a reduction of revenue.




The Company&#146;s policy regarding
advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred no advertising expenses during the years ended June
30
 2015 and 2014.




In
December 2004
 the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718
.
Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718
 companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based
compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period
during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options
 restricted
share plans
 performance-based awards
 share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such
 compensation cost
is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts
 if any
 are amortized over the respective vesting
periods of the option grant. The Company applies this statement prospectively.

Equity instruments (&#147;instruments&#148;)
issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments
 as required by FASB Accounting
Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505
defines
the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general
 the measurement date is when either a (a) performance
commitment
 as defined
 is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments
are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of
each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.




Net
loss per common share is computed pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 260
. Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed in the same way as for basic net loss.

At June 30
 2015 the Company
had 4
716
000 common shares remaining to be issued in satisfaction of the settlement agreement. These shares have not been included
in the number of diluted shares because their effect would be anti-dilutive as the Company realized losses in all periods presented
in these financial statements.




Certain amounts previously presented
for prior year have been reclassified. The reclassifications had no effect on net loss
 total assets
 or stockholders' deficit.




The
Company has reviewed all recently issued
 but not yet effective
 accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

Disclosure of accounting policy regarding (1) the principles it follows in consolidating or combining the separate financial statements
 including the principles followed in determining the inclusion or exclusion of subsidiaries or other entities in the consolidated or combined financial statements and (2) its treatment of interests (for example
 common stock
 a partnership interest or other means of exerting influence) in other entities
 for example consolidation or use of the equity or cost methods of accounting.  The accounting policy may also address the accounting treatment for intercompany accounts and transactions
 noncontrolling interest
 and the income statement treatment in consolidation for issuances of stock by a subsidiary.

 03



























Disclosure of accounting policy for computing basic and diluted earnings or loss per share for each class of common stock and participating security. Addresses all significant policy factors

 the policy for each material type of transaction is generally disclosed. If a sales transaction has multiple element arrangements (for example
 delivery of multiple products
 services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.

Lease
Commitments

The
Company gave up its leased office space in Jupiter
 Florida in January 2014
 and acquired a new office in Newport Beach
 California.
The Florida leaseholder obtained a judgment in the amount of $181
968 for the remainder of the monthly lease payments through
June 2016 pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement plus legal fees of $1
487. The Company has recorded the full amount of
the judgment
 however believes that when the facility is re-leased it may not have to pay the full amount. Upon the leaseholder's
execution of a new lease with a new tenant
 the Company plans to file for the release of the amount of the judgment over and above
the actual loss incurred by the leaseholder. There is no guarantee the property will be re-leased or that such a filing will be
successful and that the Company will be able to mitigate its loss in this way.

In
January 2014
 the Company entered into a lease at the rate of $1
439 per month which ended December 2014. In January 2015
 the
Company was equipped to operate in a virtual environment. We believe that our existing arrangement which provides for virtual
pbx telephone
 &#224; la carte conference space
 address services
 mail forwarding and hosting facilities to be highly cost
effective and adequate to meet our current needs. The Company plans to seek suitable additional space when needed.

The
Company has not invested in any real property at this time
 nor does the Company intend to do so. The Company has no formal policy
with respect to investments in real estate or investments with persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.



In
June of 2013
 a former officer of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company and its President and directors alleging several
counts
 including a breach of contract and fiduciary duty
 and seeking damages in the amount of $122
300 and other unspecified
damages. On March 20
 2015 the court entered a final judgment in the amount of $200
761 comprised of the principal amount of $122
344
plus prejudgment interest from September 15
 2012 through the date of judgment in the amount of $54
421
 costs in the amount of
$773
 and attorney's fees of $23
222. The court dismissed the case against any party not listed in the final order and the case
is now closed as to all parties. As of March 31
 2015 the Company had accrued in full for this liability of $200
761 in its financial
statements.

At June 30
 2015
 the Company
had a balance of 4
716
000 common shares remaining to be issued in satisfaction of the settlement agreement. Under the agreement
the shares can be drawn upon at any time
 provided that the number of shares of common stock of the Company beneficially owned
by the purchaser of the Siesta Flow LLC's claim does not exceed 9.99%. The number of shares required to settle this liability
is unchanged by the Company's recent reverse spilt in the number of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
