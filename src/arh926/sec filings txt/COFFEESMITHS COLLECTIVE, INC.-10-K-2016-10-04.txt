For financial reporting purposes
 the Share Exchange represents a reverse merger rather than a business combination and Private Company is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. For the periods subsequent to August 31
 2016
 the Share Exchange is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. Private Company is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Public Company (DOCASA
 Inc.
 f/k/a FWF Holdings
 Inc.) is the acquired company. Consequently
 the assets and liabilities and the operations that will be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Share Exchange will be those of the Private Company and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of the Private Company
 and the financial statements after completion of the Share Exchange will include the assets and liabilities of the Public Company and the Private Company

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the amortization period for intangible assets
 valuation and impairment valuation of intangible assets
 depreciable lives of the web site and property and equipment
 valuation of warrant and beneficial conversion feature debt discounts
 The Company evaluates its convertible debt
 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for. The result of this accounting treatment is that under certain circumstances the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument
 The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 360-10
 &ldquo;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&rdquo;. This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired
 The Company measures their financial assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For certain of our financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts payable
We have adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations
 financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value
 provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements
 but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques
 such as the market approach (comparable market prices)
 the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow)
Level 2:&nbsp;Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
Level 3:&nbsp;Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists
 therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us
 The Company recognizes revenue for our services in accordance with ASC 605-10
 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Under these guidelines
 revenue is recognized on transactions when all of the following exist: persuasive evidence of an arrangement did exist
 delivery of service has occurred

For financial reporting purposes
 the Share Exchange represents a reverse merger rather than a business combination and Private Company is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. The Share Exchange is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. Private Company is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Public Company (DOCASA
 Inc.
 f/k/a FWF Holdings
 Inc.) is the acquired company. Consequently
 the assets and liabilities and the operations that will be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Share Exchange will be those of the Private Company and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of the Private Company
 and the financial statements after completion of the Share Exchange will include the assets and liabilities of the Public Company and the Private Company
We are currently devoting all of our efforts in migrating to the specialty coffee industry
 specifically with company-operated stores.&nbsp; The Company will generate revenue through sales at ten existing and five currently under construction
 company-operated stores in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Our objective is to continue to be recognized as one of the upper tier specialty coffee retail operations.&nbsp; Similar to leading operators
 we sell our proprietary coffee and related products
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the amortization period for intangible assets
 valuation and impairment valuation of intangible assets
 allowance for accounts receivable
 depreciable lives of the web site
 valuation of warrants and beneficial conversion feature debt discounts
 valuation of derivatives
Property
Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets of three years for computer equipment
 five years for office furniture and fixtures
 and the lesser of the lease term or the useful life of the leased equipment. Leasehold improvements
 if any
The Company evaluates its convertible debt
 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for. The result of this accounting treatment is that under certain circumstances the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 360-10
 &ldquo;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&rdquo;. This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired
The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For certain of our financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts payable
We follow accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value
 provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements
 but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques
 such as the market approach (comparable market prices)
 the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow)
Level 2:&nbsp;Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
Level 3:&nbsp;Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists
 therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us
The Company recognizes revenue for our services in accordance with ASC 605-10
 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Under these guidelines
 revenue is recognized on transactions when all of the following exist: persuasive evidence of an arrangement did exist
 delivery of service has occurred
Advertising is expensed as incurred and is included in loss from operations on the accompanying statement of operations. For the years ended July 31
 2016 and 2015 advertising expense was $1

The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10
 &ldquo;Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions.&rdquo; When tax returns are filed
 it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50&nbsp;percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such
 the Company has not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of July 31
 2016
The Company adopted ASC 740-10
Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48
&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 740-10&rdquo;)
 which was issued on May&nbsp;2
 2007. ASC 740-10 amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The term &ldquo;effectively settled&rdquo; replaces the term &ldquo;ultimately settled&rdquo; when used to describe recognition
 and the terms &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; or &ldquo;settled&rdquo; replace the terms &ldquo;ultimate settlement&rdquo; or &ldquo;ultimately settled&rdquo; when used to describe measurement of a tax position under ASC 740-10. ASC 740-10 clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit
In accordance with ASC 260-10
 &ldquo;Earnings Per Share

 &ldquo;Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information&rdquo;
 the Company is required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. The Company does not have any operating segments as of July 31
The Company reviews new accounting standards and updates as issued. No new standards or updates had any material effect on these audited financial statements. The accounting pronouncements and updates issued subsequent to the date of these audited financial statements that were considered significant by management were evaluated for the potential effect on these audited financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent pronouncements will have a material effect on these audited financial statements as presented and does not anticipate the need for any future restatement of these audited financial statements because of the retro-active application of any accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to July 31
As of July 31

 and the Private Company&rsquo;s chairman (&ldquo;Allesch-Taylor
&rdquo; or &ldquo;Shareholder&rdquo;)
 was the owner of record of 99.8% of the outstanding shares of the Private Company (the &ldquo;Private Company Stock&rdquo;). Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement
 upon surrender by the Shareholder and the cancellation by the Private Company of the certificates evidencing the Private Company Stock as registered in the name of the Shareholder
 and pursuant to the registration of the Public Company in the register of Shareholder maintained by Private Company as the new holder of the Public Company Stock and the issuance of the certificates evidencing the aforementioned registration of the Private Company Stock in the name of the Public Company
 the Public Company will issue 170
000
000 shares (the &ldquo;New Shares&rdquo;) of the Company&rsquo;s common stock to the Shareholder (or his designees)
 and Allesch-Taylor will cause 99.8% of the shares of the Private Company&rsquo;s stock that he owns (the &ldquo;Allesch-Taylor Stock
&rdquo; together with the New Shares
 the &ldquo;Acquisition Stock&rdquo;) to be transferred to the Shareholder (or his designees). The Company issued Allesch-Taylor 110

 considering the aforementioned 100
000
000 shares
 of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company as of the date of the Agreement) current fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company&rsquo;s restricted common stock (the &ldquo;Deferred Shares&rdquo;) at a time to be determined by the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors
 but no later than August 31
 2017. The Deferred Shares are not conditional or contingent on any event or action by any party of the Agreement. As a result of the exchange of the Private Company Stock for the Acquisition Stock (the &ldquo;Share Exchange&rdquo;)
 the Private Company will become a subsidiary of the Public Company. See Notes 1
The closing of the Acquisition Agreement was conditioned upon certain
 limited customary representations and warranties
 as well as the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions to closing. As the parties satisfied all of the closing conditions
 on August 12
 2016
 with an effective date of August 1

Prior to the execution and delivery of the Acquisition Agreement
 our board of directors approved the Share Exchange and the transactions contemplated thereby. Similarly
Following the Share Exchange
 we have abandoned our prior business plan and we are now pursuing Private Company&rsquo;s historical businesses and proposed businesses. Private Company is in the business of the specialty coffee industry
The foregoing description of the Acquisition Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Share Exchange Agreement
 a copy of which has been filed on Form 8-K for the date of August 1
For financial reporting purposes
 the Share Exchange represents a &ldquo;reverse merger&rdquo; rather than a business combination and Private Company is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. The Share Exchange is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. Private Company is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Public Company (DOCASA
 Inc.
 f/k/a FWF Holdings
 Inc.) is the acquired company. Consequently
 the assets and liabilities and the operations that will be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Share Exchange will be those of the Private Company and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of the Private Company
 and the financial statements after completion of the Share Exchange will include the assets and liabilities of the Public Company and the Private Company
On April 29
 2015
 the Board of Directors of DOCASA authorized the execution of that certain commercial agreement (the Agreement) with Alimentos Kamuk Internacional (Costa Rica) S.A. (AKI). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Agreement
 the Company has agreed to purchase the hot sauce manufactured by AKI (the Hot Sauce) with a purchase price (the Purchase Price) that is subject to a 5%-7% annual price increase based on increased in production costs and raw materials and a potential volume discount starting from 10 pallets of a single product. For the first order
 the Purchase Price shall be payable in full in advance and for subsequent orders
 the Purchase Price shall be payable 50% in advance and the remaining balance net 30 days. In the event the relationship continues between the Company and AKI and exceeds $100
000 annually
In further accordance with the terms and provisions of the Agreement: (i) all packaging material design will be the Company's property and will be used by AKI for such products; (ii) AKI shall guarantee a one year shelf life and in the event the shelf life is extended by the Company
 the Company will indemnify AKI and be responsible for any damages
 claims or returns; (iii) the Company shall supply the artwork for the labels; and (iv) the Company shall cover all expenses associated with customs clearance
 taxes or charges incurred during importing of the Hot Sauce. As of June 30

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company sustained net losses from discontinued operations of $25
034 and used cash in operating activities of $20
676 for the year ended July 31
 2016. The Company had a working capital deficit
 stockholders&rsquo; deficit and accumulated deficit of $34
869
 $34
869 and $54
459
 respectively
 at July 31
 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company&rsquo;s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues and its ability to continue receiving investment capital and loans from third parties to sustain its current level of operations. The Company is in the process of securing working capital from investors for common stock

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
Because of the historical earnings history of the Company
 the net deferred tax assets for 2016 were fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance. The valuation allowance for the remaining net deferred tax assets was $17
746 and $9

Internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records which in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the Company&rsquo;s assets; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting
In evaluating the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31
 2016
 management used the criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;). Based on the criteria established by COSO
 management (with the participation of the CEO) identified the following material weaknesses in the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31
 2016
The Company lacked effective controls for ensuring the accuracy of reporting over significant account balances
 including the review
 approval
As a result of these material weaknesses
 management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31
 2016
Except as set forth above
 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
The Company&rsquo;s management
 including the CEO and CFO
 does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the control system&rsquo;s objectives will be met. Further
 the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more people
 or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time

We intend to adopt a code of ethics that applies to our officers
 directors and employees
 including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer
Due to our lack of operations and size
 and since we are not currently listed on a national securities exchange
 we are not subject to any listing requirements mandating the establishment of any particular committees; all functions of a nominating/governance committee were performed by our whole board of directors. Our board of directors intends to appoint such persons and form such committees as are required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges as necessary. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees at the early stage of the company&rsquo;s development
The Board of Directors is led by the Chairman who is also the controlling shareholder. The Company has two directors
 a Chief Executive Officer and a Chief Financial Officer
 both reporting to the Board of Directors. Our structure provides the Company with multiple leaders who represent the Company to our stockholders
 regulators
 business partners and other stakeholders
The Company believes this structure allows for efficient and effective oversight
 given the Company&rsquo;s relatively small size
The Board of Directors does not have a specific role in risk oversight of the Company. The Chairman

&amp;#148; &amp;#147;us
&amp;#148; &amp;#147;our
&amp;#148; or &amp;#147;DOCASA&amp;#148;) was incorporated&#13;in the State of Nevada on July 22
 2014
 under the name of FWF Holdings
 Inc. The Company changed its name on August 4
 2016.&#13;The Company was originally engaged in the business of commercial production and distribution of hot sauce. On August 4
 2016

 2016
 the Company experienced a change in control. Atlantik LP (&amp;#147;Atlantik&amp;#148;) acquired a majority of the issued&#13;and outstanding common stock of the Company in accordance with stock purchase agreements by and between Atlantik and Nami Shams&#13;(&amp;#147;Seller&amp;#148;). On the closing date
 July 8
 2016
 pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement
 Atlantik purchased&#13;from the Seller 115
000
000 shares of the Company&amp;#146;s outstanding restricted common stock for $200
000

 2016
 the Company acquired Department of Coffee and Social Affairs Limited (&amp;#147;DEPT-UK&amp;#148;)
 a United&#13;Kingdom corporation. DEPT-UK was incorporated on August 12
 2009. The acquisition of 99.8% of DEPT-UK from Stefan&#13;Allesch-Taylor (&amp;#147;Allesch-Taylor&amp;#148;) was through a stock exchange whereas the Company is obligated to issue&#13;Allesch-Taylor 170
000
000 shares of restricted common stock. The acquisition required 110
000
000 shares of DOCASA to be&#13;issued to Allesch-Taylor and
 at a date to be determined by the Board of Directors
 but no later than August 31
 2017
 the&#13;remaining 60
000
000 shares are to be issued to Allesch-Taylor. See Notes 3

 2016
 the Company acquired 115
000
000 shares of the Company&amp;#146;s common stock from Atlantik in exchange for a&#13;promissory note for $320
000 (the &amp;#147;Stock Acquisition&amp;#148;). As a result of the Stock Acquisition and the subsequent issuance&#13;to Allesch-Taylor
 Allesch-Taylor
 the Chairman of the Company

 the Share Exchange represents a &amp;#34;reverse merger&amp;#34; rather than a business combination and&#13;Private Company is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. The Share Exchange is being accounted for as a reverse-merger&#13;and recapitalization. Private Company is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Public Company (DOCASA
 Inc.
 f/k/a&#13;FWF Holdings
 Inc.) is the acquired company. Consequently
 the assets and liabilities and the operations that will be reflected&#13;in the historical financial statements prior to the Share Exchange will be those of the Private Company and will be recorded at&#13;the historical cost basis of the Private Company
 and the financial statements after completion of the Share Exchange will include&#13;the assets and liabilities of the Public Company and the Private Company

 specifically with company-operated&#13;stores. The Company will generate revenue through sales at ten existing and five currently under construction

&#13;&amp;#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&amp;#148;. This statement requires that long-lived assets and&#13;certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying&#13;amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying&#13;amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered&#13;to be impaired

 &amp;#147;Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions.&amp;#148; When tax returns are&#13;filed
 it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others&#13;are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.&#13;In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the&#13;period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be&#13;sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset&#13;or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the&#13;largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50&amp;#160;percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing&#13;authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above&#13;should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated&#13;interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions&#13;are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such
 the Company has not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax&#13;benefits. As of July 31

&amp;#148; (&amp;#147;ASC 740-10&amp;#148;)
&#13;which was issued on May&amp;#160;2
 2007. ASC 740-10 amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a&#13;tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The term &amp;#147;effectively&#13;settled&amp;#148; replaces the term &amp;#147;ultimately settled&amp;#148; when used to describe recognition
 and the terms &amp;#147;settlement&amp;#148;&#13;or &amp;#147;settled&amp;#148; replace the terms &amp;#147;ultimate settlement&amp;#148; or &amp;#147;ultimately settled&amp;#148; when used to&#13;describe measurement of a tax position under ASC 740-10. ASC 740-10 clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon&#13;the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively&#13;settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit

 the Share Exchange represents a &amp;#147;reverse merger&amp;#148; rather than a business combination&#13;and Private Company is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction. The Share Exchange is being accounted for as a&#13;reverse-merger and recapitalization. Private Company is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Public Company (DOCASA
&#13;Inc.
 f/k/a FWF Holdings
 Inc.) is the acquired company. Consequently
 the assets and liabilities and the operations that will&#13;be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Share Exchange will be those of the Private Company and will&#13;be recorded at the historical cost basis of the Private Company
 and the financial statements after completion of the Share Exchange&#13;will include the assets and liabilities of the Public Company and the Private Company

 the Board of Directors of DOCASA authorized the execution of that certain commercial agreement (the &amp;#34;Agreement&amp;#34;)&#13;with Alimentos Kamuk Internacional (Costa Rica) S.A. (&amp;#34;AKI&amp;#34;). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Agreement
&#13;the Company has agreed to purchase the hot sauce manufactured by AKI (the &amp;#34;Hot Sauce&amp;#34;) with a purchase price (the &amp;#34;Purchase&#13;Price&amp;#34;) that is subject to a 5%-7% annual price increase based on increased in production costs and raw materials and a potential&#13;volume discount starting from 10 pallets of a single product. For the first order
 the Purchase Price shall be payable in full&#13;in advance and for subsequent orders
 the Purchase Price shall be payable 50% in advance and the remaining balance net 30 days.&#13;In the event the relationship continues between the Company and AKI and exceeds $100

 &amp;#147;Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions.&amp;#148; When tax returns are&#13;filed
 it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others&#13;are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.&#13;In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the&#13;period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be&#13;sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset&#13;or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the&#13;largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50&amp;#160;percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing&#13;authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above&#13;should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated&#13;interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions&#13;are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such
 the Company has not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax&#13;benefits. As of July 31
 2016

 &lt;i&gt;&amp;#147;&lt;/i&gt;Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No.&amp;#160;48
&amp;#148; (&amp;#147;ASC 740-10&amp;#148;)
&#13;which was issued on May&amp;#160;2
 2007. ASC 740-10 amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a&#13;tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The term &amp;#147;effectively&#13;settled&amp;#148; replaces the term &amp;#147;ultimately settled&amp;#148; when used to describe recognition
 and the terms &amp;#147;settlement&amp;#148;&#13;or &amp;#147;settled&amp;#148; replace the terms &amp;#147;ultimate settlement&amp;#148; or &amp;#147;ultimately settled&amp;#148; when used to&#13;describe measurement of a tax position under ASC 740-10. ASC 740-10 clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon&#13;the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively&#13;settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit
