 references to key markets where we
        operate and the market for our securities.&#160; These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions
        and analyses we make in light of our experience and our interpretation of current conditions
 historical trends and expected future developments
 as well as other factors that we believe are appropriate in the circumstance.
    

Whether actual results and developments will agree with our expectations and predictions is subject to many risks and
        uncertainties. Accordingly
 there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations and predictions. We believe these factors include
 but are not limited to
 the following:
    



          

              


we have a limited operating history with significant losses and expect losses to continue for the foreseeable
                  future;




    



          

              


we could face intense competition
 which could result in lower revenues and higher expenditures and could
                  adversely affect our results of operations;




    



          

              


we are governed by only three persons serving as directors and officers which may lead to faulty corporate
                  governance;




    




            

                


                





    



          

              


we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs due to changes in general
                  economic conditions;




    



          

              


              




    



          

              


we have a limited operating history and if we are not successful in growing our business
 then we may have to
                  scale back or even cease our ongoing business operations;




    



          

              


if our intellectual property is not adequately protected
 then we may&#160;not be able to compete effectively and we
                  may&#160;not be profitable;
              
                





      

        

        



    



          

              


if we are the subject of an intellectual property infringement claim
 the cost of participating in any
                  litigation could impact our ability to stay in business;




    



          

              


we could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect any of our food and nutritional products
                  and intellectual property rights against infringement
 and any related litigation could be time-consuming and costly;




    



          

              


if we fail to effectively manage our growth our future business results could be harmed and our managerial and
                  operational resources may be strained;




    



          

              


if we fail to effectively manage our growth our future business results could be harmed and our managerial and
                  operational resources may be strained;




    



          

              


our services may become obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to respond adequately to rapidly changing
                  technology and customer demands;




    



          

              


our failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product
                  enhancements could significantly harm product sales and harm our financial condition and operating results;




    



          

              


if we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to adequately meet the changing needs of our customers
                  some of our products could fail in the marketplace
 which could negatively impact our revenues
 financial condition and operating results.





      




          

              


we are affected by laws and governmental regulations with potential penalties or claims
 which could harm our
                  financial condition and operating results;




    



          

              


since we rely on independent third parties for the manufacture and supply of certain of our products
 if these
                  third parties fail to reliably supply products to us at required levels of quality and which are manufactured in compliance with applicable laws
 then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed;




    



          

              


we may incur material product liability claims
 which could increase our costs and harm our financial condition
                  and operating results;




    



          

              


unless we can generate sufficient cash from operations or additional raise funds
 we may not be able to meet our
                  debt obligations;




    



          

              


              




    



          

              


if we do not manage our supply chain effectively
 our operating results may be adversely affected;




    



          

              


our stock price may be volatile
 which may result in losses to our shareholders;




    



          

              


our common shares are thinly traded and our shareholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices
 or at all;




    


      

        

        





          

              


the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small and
                  developing company
 which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Our shareholders may be unable to sell their common stock at or above their purchase price if at all
 which may result in substantial losses to you;




    



          

              


              




    



          

              


we are listed on the OTCQB quotation system and our common stock is subject to &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules which could
                  negatively impact our liquidity and our shareholders&#8217; ability to sell their shares;




    



          

              


              




    



          

              


the elimination of monetary liability against our directors
 officers and employees under Nevada law and the
                  existence of indemnification rights of our directors
 officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors
 officers and employees;




    



          

              


our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have
                  increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.




    

Consequently all forward-looking statements made herein are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no
        assurance that our actual results or the developments we anticipate will be realized. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this
        report. For a more detailed discussion of the principal factors that could cause actual results to be materially different
 you should read our risk factors in Item 1A

Trident Brands Incorporated was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 5
 2007 as Sandfield Ventures Corp. Its
        primary business was resource exploration in that state but after a period of time management of the Company decided to take a new direction for the business and focus on consumer goods with a focus on nutritional products and ingredients.&#160; We are
        currently in the product introduction and commercialization phase of this business focus.
    

On June 12
 2013 the Board of Directors approved an agreement and plan of merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary called
        Trident Brands Incorporated.&#160; At that point we changed our name from Sandfield Ventures Corp. to Trident Brands Incorporated and Mark Holcombe assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer
 President
 Secretary and Treasurer.
    

Following that
 on July 9
 2013
 our Board of Directors approved a resolution to affect a 4 for 1 forward stock split.
        Upon effect of the forward split
 our authorized capital increased from 75
000
000 to 300
000
000 shares of common stock and correspondingly
 our issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from 7
000
000 to 28
000
000 shares of common
        stock
 all with a par value of $0.001
    

On August 1
 2013
 our directors approved the adoption of our 2013 Stock Option Plan which permits us to issue up to
        4
200
000 shares of our common stock to directors
 officers
 employees and consultants of our company upon the exercise of stock options granted under the 2013 Stock Option Plan.
    

On December 23
 2013
 we signed a 15 year license agreement (including a ten year extension option) with Everlast&#174; World&#8217;s
        Boxing Headquarters Corp.
 International Brand Management &amp; Licensing
 to market and sell products in the nutritional foods and supplements category under the Everlast&#174; brand. This licensing agreement enables us to introduce a portfolio of
        nutritional products in categories such as supplements and functional foods using this brand mark.
    

On March 21
 2014
 we appointed the following individuals as officers and directors:
    



          

              


Donald MacPhee was appointed to our Board of Directors
 Chair of the Audit Committee and as a member of the
                  Corporate Governance Committee.




    



          

              


Scott Chapman was appointed to our Board of Directors
 Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee
 member of
                  the Audit Committee and member of the Compensation Committee.




    



          

              


Michael Browne was appointed as our President
 Chief Financial Officer
 Treasurer and Secretary.




    



          

              


              




    

At the same time Mark Holcombe resigned as Chief Executive Officer
 President
 Secretary and Treasurer
 and was appointed
        as Chair of the Board of Directors and Chair of the Compensation Committee. Mr. Holcombe's resignation as Chief Executive Officer
 President
 Secretary and Treasurer was not the result of any disagreement with our Company regarding its operations
        policies
 practices or otherwise.
    
      

      

        

        



On May 5

        pre-qualified and must meet our stringent quality and performance standards.
    

    
    

    
    

We compete in the highly competitive branded nutritional products and functional foods market segments. These markets are
        highly competitive with many companies
 large and small
 competing for market share. The nutritional products market is one of the fastest growing markets in the world producing close to 32 billion dollars in revenue in 2012
 and is projected to
        double
 producing revenues exceeding 60 billion dollars by 2021 according to the Nutritional Business Journal. With the combination of high quality
 scientifically designed and cost competitive products
 and the equity in our brands
 we believe we
        will be able to gain market share in rapidly growing markets.
    

    
    

Our operations
 supply chain and products are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various
        regions where we operate
 including the U.S. and Canada.&#160; These laws
 regulations and policies are implemented
 as applicable in each jurisdiction
 on the national
 federal
 state
 provincial and local levels.&#160; We believe we have processes and
        systems in place throughout our supply chain to meet the requirements of these regulations.

We operate our business via resources that provide services to the Company on a contractual basis.&#160; We feel this is most

 health
 annuity
 insurance
 profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however
 we may adopt such plans in the future. Except for our stock option plan
 there are
          presently no personal benefits available to our officers and directors.
    

    
    

We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders.&#160; We will make our financial
        information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules of Regulation S-K for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.&#160; We are subject to disclosure filing
        requirements
 including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly.&#160; In addition
 we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required.&#160; We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the
        event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act.&#160; The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 (SEC)
 at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street
        NE
 Washington
 DC 20549.&#160; The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.&#160; The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports
 proxy and information
        statements
 and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
    


      

        

        



    
    

    
    

You should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report
        before making an investment decision with regard to our securities. The statements contained in or incorporated into this current report on Form 10-K that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
        uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur
 our business
 financial condition or results of operations could be
        harmed. In that case
 the trading price of our common stock could decline
 and you may lose all or part of your investment.
    

We have a limited operating history with significant losses and expect losses to
        continue for the foreseeable future.
    
We have yet to establish a history of profitable operations
        and
 as at November 30
 2018
 have an accumulated deficit of $22
025
441
since our inception on November 5
 2007.&#160; Early in the prior years we have
        generated only nominal revenues since our inception and thus have incurred operating losses.&#160; Our profitability will require the successful commercialization and sales of our planned products at acceptable margins.&#160;We may not be able to
        successfully achieve any of these requirements.
    
      
We could face intense competition
 which could result in lower revenues and higher
        expenditures and could adversely affect our results of operations.
    

Unless we keep pace with changing market demands
 we could lose existing customers and more importantly fail to win new
        and retain any future customers. In order to compete effectively in the food and nutritional products industry
 we must continually design
 develop implement and market new and/or enhanced products and strategies. Our future success will depend
 in
        part
 upon our ability to address the changing and sophisticated needs of the marketplace. Our strategy of expanding our food and nutrition business may not be successful and could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.
    

Further
 our plan to pursue sales of our product in international markets may be limited by risks related to conditions in
        such markets.
    


We are governed by only three persons serving as directors and two of them act as
          officers of the company which may lead to faulty corporate governance.
      

Currently our board includes only one independent director and as a result not all of our committees are independent.
          This could lead to less than preferable governance practices due to this lack of total independence.
      

      
      

Success depends on the acquisition of key personnel. We will have to compete with other companies both within and
          outside the food and nutritional products industry to recruit and retain competent employees and contract resources. If we cannot maintain qualified resources to meet the needs of our anticipated growth
 this could have a material adverse effect
          on our business and financial condition.

    

Our business and operating results could be harmed if we fail to manage our growth
        or change.
    

Our business may experience periods of rapid change and/or growth that could place significant demands on our personnel
        operating and financial resources.&#160;To manage possible growth and change
 we must continue to locate skilled professionals in the food and nutritional products industries and adequate funds in a timely manner.
    
We have a limited operating history and if we are not successful in growing our
        business
 then we may have to scale back or even cease our ongoing business operations.
    

      

        

        



    
      
There can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. We have a limited operating history. Our success is
        significantly dependent on the successful marketing and sales of our food and nutritional products
 which cannot be guaranteed. Our operations will be subject to all the risks inherent in the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant
        operating history. We may be unable profitably sell our food and nutritional products and thus operate on a profitable basis. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by enterprises in the development stage. If
        our business plan is not successful
 and we are not able to operate profitably
 investors may lose some or all of their investment in our company.
    
If our intellectual property is not adequately protected
 then we may&#160;not be able
        to compete effectively and we may&#160;not be profitable.
    
Our commercial success may depend
 in part
 on obtaining and maintaining patent protection
 trade secret protection and
        regulatory protection of our technologies and products as well as successfully defending third-party challenges to such technologies and products. We will be able to protect our technologies and product from use by third parties only to the extent
        that valid and enforceable patents
 trade secrets or regulatory protection cover them and we have exclusive rights to use them. The ability of our licensors
 collaborators and suppliers to maintain their patent rights against third-party challenges
        to their validity
 scope or enforceability will also play an important role in determining our future.
    

The patent positions of technology related companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual
        questions that include unresolved principles and issues. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed regarding such companies&#8217; patents has emerged to date in the United States
 and the patent situation outside the United States is
        even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly
 we cannot predict with any certainty the range of
        claims that may be allowed or enforced concerning our patents.
    
We may also rely on trade secrets to protect our technologies
 especially where we do not believe patent protection is
        appropriate or obtainable. However
 trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we seek to protect confidential information
 in part
 through confidentiality agreements with our employees
 consultants and scientific and other advisors
 they may
        unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim against a third party related to the illegal acquisition and use of trade secrets can be expensive and time consuming
 and the outcome is often unpredictable.
        If we are not able to maintain patent or trade secret protection on our technologies and products
 then we may not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing products
 and we may not be able to operate profitability.
    
If we are the subject of an intellectual property infringement claim
 the cost of
        participating in any litigation could impact our ability to stay in business.
    
There has been
 and we believe that there will continue to be
 significant litigation and demands for licenses in our
        industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Although we anticipate having a valid defense to any allegation that our current products
 production methods and other activities infringe the valid and enforceable intellectual
        property rights of any third parties
 we cannot be certain that a third party will not challenge our position in the future. Other parties may own patent rights that we might infringe with our products or other activities
 and our competitors or
        other patent holders may assert that our products and the methods we employ are covered by their patents. These parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial litigation expenses and
 if successful
 may require us to
        pay substantial damages. Some of our potential competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation
 and depending on the circumstances
 we could be forced to stop or delay our research
 development
 manufacturing or
        sales activities. The impact of this could impact our ability to stay in business.
    

We could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect any of our
        food and nutritional products and intellectual property rights against infringement
 and any related litigation could be time-consuming and costly.
    

Our success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree on our licenses and the ability to use our food and
        nutritional products. If any of our competitor&#8217;s copies or otherwise gains access to any of our competitive advantages or develops similar products independently
 our ability to compete would be negatively impacted.
    


      

        

        



We also consider our assigned trademarks invaluable to our ability to continue to develop and maintain the goodwill and
        recognition associated with our brands. These and any other measures that we may take to protect our intellectual property rights
 which presently are based upon a combination of copyright
 trade secret and trademark laws
 may not be adequate to
        prevent their unauthorized use.
    
Further
 the laws of foreign countries may provide inadequate protection of such intellectual property rights. We may need
        to bring legal claims to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights. Any litigation
 whether successful or unsuccessful
 could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources. In addition
 notwithstanding any rights we have
        secured in our intellectual property
 other persons may bring claims against us that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights
 including claims based upon the content we license from third parties or claims that our intellectual
        property right interests are not valid. Any claims against us
 with or without merit
 could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate
 divert our attention and resources
 result in the loss of goodwill associated with our service marks or
        require us to make changes to our website or other of our technologies.
    

If we fail to effectively manage our growth our future business results could be
        harmed and our managerial and operational resources may be strained.
    

As we proceed with the commercialization of our portfolio
 we expect to experience significant and rapid growth in the
        scope and complexity of our business. We will need to add resources to market our services
 manage operations
 handle sales and marketing efforts and perform finance and accounting functions. We will be required to hire a broad range of additional
        personnel in order to successfully advance our operations. This growth is likely to place a strain on our management and operational resources. The failure to develop and implement effective systems
 or to hire and retain sufficient personnel for
        the performance of all of the functions necessary to effectively service and manage our potential business
 or the failure to manage growth effectively
 could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
    

Our services may become obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to respond
        adequately to rapidly changing technology and customer demands.
    

Our industry is characterized by rapid changes in market demands. As a result
 our products may quickly become obsolete
        and unmarketable. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to and anticipate market demands
 develop new products and enhance our current products on a timely and cost-effective basis. Further
 our products must remain competitive
        with those of other companies with substantially greater resources. We may experience technical or other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development
 introduction or marketing of new products or enhanced versions of existing products.
        Also
 we may not be able to adapt new or enhanced services to comply with emerging industry or governmental standards.
    

Our failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand
        for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm product sales and harm our financial condition and operating results.
    

Our business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and
        respond to these changes
 and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes. The nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand new product introductions and
        enhancements. Our failure to predict these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of our products and thus commercial success.
    

If we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to adequately meet the
        changing needs of our customers
 some of our products could fail in the marketplace
 which could negatively impact our revenues
 financial condition and operating results.
    


      

        

        



The business of marketing of food and nutritional products is highly competitive and sensitive to the introduction of new
        products
 including various prescription drugs
 which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. These market segments include numerous manufacturers
 distributors
 marketers
 retailers and physicians that actively compete for the
        business of consumers.&#160; We must continually adapt to marketplace demands in order to avoid negatively impacting our results.
    

We are affected by laws and governmental regulations with potential penalties or
        claims
 which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
    

The formulation
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 distribution
 advertising
 licensing
 sale and storage of our
        products are affected by laws and governmental regulations.
    

New regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or
        discontinuation of product sales and may negatively impact the marketing of our products
 resulting in loss of revenues.&#160; We are subject to FDA rules for current good manufacturing practices
 or GMPs
 for the manufacture
 packing
 labeling and
        holding of nutritional products distributed in the United States.&#160; We have retained supply partners that maintain a comprehensive quality assurance program designed to address these regulations.
    

If these supply partners fail to comply with the GMPs and regulations
 this could negatively impact our reputation and
        ability to sell products even though we are not directly liable under the GMPs and regulations for such compliance.
    

Since we rely on independent third parties for the manufacture and supply of
        certain of our products
 if these third parties fail to reliably supply products to us at required levels of quality and which are manufactured in compliance with applicable laws
 then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed.
    

We cannot be assured that our outside contract manufacturers will continuously
&#160; reliably supply products to us at the
        levels of quality
 or the quantities
 we require
 and in compliance with applicable laws
 including under the FDA&#8217;s GMP regulations.&#160; Additionally
 while we are not presently aware of any current liquidity issues with our suppliers
 we cannot be
        assured we will not experience financial hardship or capacity constraints in future that could interrupt supply and thus our ability to profitably market our products.
We may incur material product liability claims
 which could increase our costs and
        harm our financial condition and operating results.
    

We rely upon published and unpublished safety information including clinical studies on ingredients used in our products.
        Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur. As a marketer of dietary and nutritional supplements and other products that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies
 we may be
        subjected to various product liability claims
 including that the products contain contaminants
 the products include inadequate instructions as to their uses
 or the products include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions
        with other substances. It is possible that widespread product liability claims could increase our costs
 and adversely affect our revenues and operating income. Moreover
 liability claims arising from a serious adverse event may increase our costs
        through higher insurance premiums and deductibles
 and may make it more difficult to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future.
    

    
    

Many of our customers buy from us under purchase orders
 and we generally do not have long-term agreements with or
        commitments from these customers for the purchase of products.&#160; We cannot provide assurance that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our
        existing customer base.&#160; Decreases in our customers&#8217; sales volumes or orders for products supplied by us may have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition or results of operations.
    
      

      

        

        



    

If we do not manage our supply chain effectively
 our operating results may be
        adversely affected
    

Our supply chain is complex. &#160;We rely on suppliers for our raw materials and for the manufacturing
 processing
 packaging
        and distribution of many of our products. &#160;The inability of any of these suppliers to deliver or perform for us in a timely or cost-effective manner could cause our operating costs to rise and our margins to fall. &#160;We must continuously monitor our
        inventory and product mix against forecasted demand or risk having inadequate supplies to meet consumer demand as well as having too much inventory that may reach its expiration date. &#160;If we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently and
        ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand
 our operating costs could increase and our margins could fall.
    

    
    
Our stock price may be volatile
 which may result in losses to our shareholders.
    
The stock markets have experienced
          significant price and trading volume fluctuations
 quotation system in which shares of our common stock
          are listed
 have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors
 including the
          following
 some of which are beyond our control:
    



          

              


              




    



          

              


changes in expectations of our future financial performance
 including financial estimates by securities
                  analysts and investors;




    



          

              


              




    



          

              


              




    



          

              


              




    
Domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations
        as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance
 may adversely affect the price of our common stock.
    

Our common shares are thinly traded and our shareholders may be unable to sell at
        or near ask prices
 or at all.
    

We cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for trading our common stock will be sustained. Our shares
        have historically been sporadically or &#8220;thinly-traded&#8221; meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at certain given time may be relatively small or non-existent.
    

This situation is attributable to a number of factors
 including the fact that we are a small company in its development
        phase which is relatively unknown to stock analysts
 stock brokers
 institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume. Even if we came to the attention of such persons
 those persons may be
        reluctant to follow
 purchase
 or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence
 there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in
        our shares is minimal or non-existent
 as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous trades without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot be assured that a
        broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained
 or that current trading levels will be sustained.
    


      

        

        



The market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as
        a relatively small and developing company
 which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Our shareholders may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all
 which may result in substantial losses to you.
    

Shareholders should be aware that
 according to SEC Release No. 34-29093
 the market for penny stock/over the counter
        stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices
        through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and
        undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level
 along with the resulting inevitable
        collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price and there can be no assurance that our shares could not be impacted by these practices.
    

We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common shareholders and as a
        result shareholders may only realize a return when the shares are sold.
    

We presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future. If payment
        of dividends does occur at some point in the future
 it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings
 if any
 capital requirements
 and general financial condition. The payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of
        our Board of Directors. We presently intend to retain all earnings to implement our business plan; accordingly
 we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future.
    

We are listed on the OTCQB quotation system and our common stock is subject to
        &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules which could negatively impact our liquidity and our shareholders&#8217; ability to sell their shares.
    

Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB. We must comply with numerous NASDAQ MarketPlace rules in order to
        maintain the listing of our common stock on the OTCQB. There can be no assurance that we can continue to meet the requirements to maintain the quotation on the OTCQB listing of our common stock. If we are unable to maintain our listing on the
        OTCQB
 the market liquidity of our common stock may be severely limited.
    
    
    

The market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers
 and we
        expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past
 plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the
        market price of its securities. We may
 in the future
 be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management&#8217;s attention and resources and impact our ability to
        operate as a going concern.
    

 officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors
 officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company
        and may discourage lawsuits against our directors
 officers and employees.
    

 we are prepared to give such indemnification to our
        directors and officers to the extent provided for by Nevada law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company
        incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers
 which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit
        against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties
 and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions
 if successful
 might otherwise
        benefit our company and shareholders.
    


      

        

        



    

Our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and
        public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.
    
Because our common stock is publicly traded
 we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal
 state and
        financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities
 including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
 the SEC and FINRA
 have issued
        requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress
 most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these regulations
        have resulted in
 and are likely to continue resulting in
 increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Because new and modified laws
        regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity
 their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may
        result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.

Item 3. Legal
            Proceedings
    




 2019
 the Company filed a lawsuit against Everlast World&#8217;s Boxing Headquarters Corp. (&#8220;Everlast&#8221;). This action involves
          Everlast&#8217;s deceptive attempts to prevent the Company from exercising its right to terminate a License Agreement between the parties pursuant to which Trident had the right to market certain Everlast-branded products. In reliance on both
          Everlast&#8217;s promises to modify the royalty structure under the License agreement to support Trident&#8217;s changes to the business model for marketing and selling Everlast-branded products
 the Company refrained from terminating the hugely unprofitable
          License Agreement. However
 unbeknownst to the Company
 Everlast had no intent of honoring its promises
 intending only to deceptively induce Trident to continue incurring minimum royalties after the Company had informed Everlast that the
          business model was broken and should be discontinued. Everlast pretended to support restructuring of the business model and royalty structure to induce the Company to continue paying royalties rather than terminate the License Agreement
          altogether. During that time
 Trident also expended further capital to develop
 market and sell Everlast-branded products when in truth Everlast had no intention of supporting a modified royalty structure. If Trident had known that Everlast had
          no intention of actually right-sizing the royalty structure under the License Agreement
 Trident would have terminated the License Agreement and stopped throwing good money after bad. Trident now brings this suit to enforce Everlast&#8217;s promises


On January 17
 2019
 Everlast World&#8217;s Boxing Headquarters Corp.
              (&#8220;Everlast&#8221;) filed a counter civil lawsuit against the Company and other defendants. In that lawsuit
 Everlast seeks payment from the defendants under a License Agreement dated June 4
 2013
 for $425
555 in unpaid royalties allegedly due and
              owing under the License Agreement and interest on the allegedly unpaid royalties of $96
265
 which interest allegedly continues to accrue. Everlast has also sought all costs
 expenses
 and legal fees incurred by Everlast in collecting monies
              that it claims are due under the License Agreement. The case is at an early stage
 and the defendants (including the Company) have not yet appeared or answered in the case.

The OTCQB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes
 last sale prices and volume information in
        over-the-counter (OTC) securities.&#160; The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service
 market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements per se
 to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB
 issuers must remain current in their
        filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. Market Makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their
        required filings will be removed following a 30 or 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future
 we intend to retain any
        earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business
 and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be
        dependent upon then existing conditions
 including our financial condition and results of operations
 capital requirements

 and other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant.
    

Section Rule 15(g) of
            the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
    

The Company's shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended that imposes
        additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5
000
000 or individuals with net worth in
        excess of $1
000
000 or annual income exceeding $200
000 or $300
000 jointly with their spouses). For transactions covered by the Rule
 the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase and have received the
        purchaser's written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently
 the Rule may affect the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities and also may affect your ability to sell your shares in the secondary market.
    

Section 15(g) also imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell penny securities. These rules
        require a one page summary of certain essential items. The items include the risk of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary marketing; terms important to in understanding of the function of the penny stock market
 such as
        bid and offer quotes
 a dealers spread and broker/dealer compensation; the broker/dealer compensation
 the broker/dealers duties to its customers
 including the disclosures required by any other penny stock disclosure rules; and the customers
        rights and remedies in causes of fraud in penny stock transactions.

 they may prove to be incorrect.&#160; Forward-looking statements are also subject to certain factors


    


        

            


        
          

        

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S.
                GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 related revenues and expenses
 and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial
                statements.&#160; The estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on our experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.&#160; We continually evaluate the information
                that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes.&#160; The following are the accounting estimates which we believe to be most important to our business.


        
          

        

            


        

            


        

Accounts receivable are recorded at their original invoice amounts. We regularly review collectability and
                establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts as necessary.


        
          


    


      

        

        



    


        

            


        
          

        

Inventory is our largest current asset other than cash and consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods
                held for sale.&#160; Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
 measured on a first-in
 first out basis
 or estimated net realizable value.&#160; In order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date
 we evaluate a number of
                factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory.&#160; These factors include the age of inventory
 the amount of inventory held by type
 future demand for products
 and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by
                selling the inventory.&#160; Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time
 using available information
 expected business plans
 and expected market conditions.&#160; As a result
 the actual amount received on sale could
                differ from our estimated value of inventory.


        
          

        

            



    

        

We review our long-lived assets
 to include intangible assets subject to amortization
 for recoverability whenever
                events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets (collectively referred to as the asset) may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include
 but are not limited
                to:

 the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.&#160;



    

        

We continually evaluate whether such events and circumstances have occurred. When such events or circumstances
                exist
 the recoverability of the asset's carrying value shall be determined by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows (cash inflows less associated cash outflows) that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a
                direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset. To date
 no such impairment has occurred. To the extent such events or circumstances occur that could affect the recoverability of our long-lived assets
 we may incur charges
                for impairment in the future.


        
          

        

            


        
          

        

We recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following have occurred:&#160; a sales
                agreement is in place; price is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured. Agreed trading terms with customers such as value incentives
 rebates
 early payment discounts and other discounts are recorded as reductions to
                revenues at the time of sale.


        
          

        

            



    


        

            


        
          



      

        

        




        

            




        
          

        

We maintain a stock incentive plan under which stock options and other stock-based awards may be granted to
                selected officer
 directors and service providers.&#160; For grants of stock options
 we are required to estimate a number of inputs at each grant date
 such as the estimated life of the option
 future stock price volatility
 and the forfeiture
                rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non-employee directors.&#160;&#160; Once determined at the grant date
 the fair value of the stock option award is recorded over the
                vesting period of the options granted.


        
          

        

            


        
          

        

We are liable for income taxes in jurisdictions where we operate.&#160; Our effective tax rate may differ from the
                statutory tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of any permanent differences
 investment and other tax credits
 as well as the provision for income taxes at different rates in various jurisdictions.&#160; In making an
                estimate of our income tax liability
 we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction.&#160; This process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of
                the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes.&#160; These differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses may result in deferred
                income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet.&#160; We also estimate the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to
                reduce future taxes payable.&#160;&#160; We assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they
                can be applied
 the number of years based on management&#8217;s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances.&#160; Given our history of operating losses we have taken a valuation allowance to offset the potential
                future value of loss carry-forwards.

While still in the early stages of
          commercialization
 our revenues increased 19% in 2018 to $5
655
431 versus $4
743
421 in the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily attributed to our Trident Sports Nutrition operating subsidiary
 associated with a private label supply

929 or 6.2% of revenues versus $95
399 or 2.0% of revenues in the prior year. The improvement in margin percentage reflects initial market
        commercialization of both Brain Armor&#174; and P2N Peak Performance Nutrition&#174; branded products.

Operating expenses for the year ended November 30
 2018 were $6
152
660 as compared
          to $3
323
369 for the comparative period in 2017
The increase in our operating expenses is primarily due to increased general and administrative costs as we invest in the operational
          infrastructure necessary to build out our organization to support current and future growth. Significant increases were in non-cash options expense of $1
194
775
 non-cash provision of bad debts of $617
010 and legal expenses of $430
983. 
The Company incurred an impairment loss of

Liquidity and Capital
            Resources
    

Our cash and cash equivalents balance at November 30
 2018 was $3
133
303. Management believes the current funds available
        to the company will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the date the financial statements are issued.
    

On January 29
 2015
 we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a non-US institutional investor whereby we
        agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $2
300
000 of senior secured convertible debentures
 convertible into shares of the company&#8217;s common stock.&#160; We received $1
800
000 of the funds from the transaction on February 5
 2015 and the
        balance of $500
000 on May 14
 2015.&#160; On September 26
 2016
 we entered into a Convertible Promissory Note Amendment Agreement with this investor whereby we agreed to extend the maturity date and amend the interest payable on the senior secured
        convertible debentures
 whereby we extended the term of the notes through September 30
 2019 and interest rate was increased from 6% per annum to 8% per annum.&#160;&#160; The convertible debentures are convertible into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock
        at an initial conversion price of $.71 per share for an aggregate of up to 3
239
437 shares.
On September 26
 2016
pursuant to which
 in consideration for proceeds of
        $4
100
000
 we issued a secured convertible promissory note in the amount of $4
100
Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement
 the investor has agreed
 from time to time after January 1
 2017
 to
        make additional investments at our request of up to $5
900
000 ($10
000
000 in the aggregate) in one or more tranches of not less than one tranche during any 60 day period. The funding of any tranche under the agreement (other than the first
        $4
100
000 which has been funded) is subject to the mutual agreement of the parties as to the use of funds. The parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to pre-approve use of funds within 120 days following September 26
On May 9
 2017
 the Company received the second tranche of funding with proceeds of $4
400
000 and on May 16
 2018 the third tranche of funding with proceeds of $1
500
000 for a total investment by the investor
        of $10
000
000. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the secured convertible note for general working capital purposes including
 without limitation
 settlement of accounts payable and repayment of mature loans. In consideration of each
        advance made by the investor pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement
 we will issue to the investor a convertible promissory note of equal value
 maturing three years after issuance
 and bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum. Each note
        will be secured in first priority against the present and after acquired assets of the Company
 and will be convertible in whole or in part at the option of the holder into common shares of the Company at a conversion price per share of $.60
 equal
        to a 25% discount to the 10 day average closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock for the period immediately preceding the issuance of the applicable note. 
    


 2018 the Company and Fengate entered into a Securities Purchase Amendment Agreement pursuant to which the Company has
        agreed to issue to Fengate an additional convertible promissory (the &#8220;2018 Convertible Note&#8221;) of up to $10
000
000
 subject to certain terms and conditions.&#160; Each portion of the principal amount advanced pursuant to the 2018 Convertible Note will
        bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and will be payable monthly in arrears to Fengate.&#160; Outstanding principal and interest will continue to be secured by the general security agreement dated September 26
 2016
 which forms a
        part of the Agreement.&#160; The holder of the note may also elect from time to time to convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal and interest into common shares of the Company at a 25% discount to the average closing price of the common
        shares during the 10 trading days immediately prior to the applicable conversion date.&#160;&#160; The 2018 Convertible Note will mature on November 30
 2019
 provided that Fengate may unilaterally postpone the maturity date to May 31
 2020.

          
            
On November 30
 2018 the Company received the first tranche of funding with proceeds of $3
400
780. The Company intends
              to use the proceeds of the secured convertible note for general working capital purposes including
 without limitation
 product development
 inventory
 and marketing and selling expenses.
          
            
On March 11
 2019
 each convertible note including the 2018 Convertible Note disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated
              financial statements were amended to extend the maturity dates to May 31
 2020.

Evaluation of
              Disclosure Controls and Procedures
      

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and the
          principal financial officer
 we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
 as
          of the end of the period covered by this report.&#160; Based on this evaluation
 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to
          the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting&#8221;. However
 the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission
          reports is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive and financial officer
 recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company
          particularly during the period when this report was being prepared.
      


Management's Annual
            Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
    

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such
        term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act
 for the Company.&#160; Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
        accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
        acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
    

Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control
 and
        accordingly
 even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. In addition
 effective internal control at a point in time may
        become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.
    

A material weakness is a significant deficiency
 or combination of significant deficiencies
 that results in there being a
        more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
    

Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 management
        conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 as of November 30
 2018
 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
        Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).&#160; Based on its evaluation under this framework
 management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of November 30
 2018 and identified the following material
        weaknesses:
    

We
        have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting.
    

Inadequate Segregation of
          Duties
    

Lack of Audit Committee

 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and
        monitoring of required internal controls and procedures.
    

Management is committed to improving its internal controls and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address
        shortfalls in staffing and to assist the Company with accounting and finance responsibilities
 (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are
        sufficient personnel and (3) may consider appointing outside directors and audit committee members in the future.
    


      

        

        



Management has discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to
        the nature of this material weakness
 there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected.
    

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal
        control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report.
    

Changes in Internal Controls Over
            Financial Reporting
    

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter
        for our fiscal year ended November 30
 2018 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

      &#160;

    
    

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 requires our executive officers and directors and
        persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership
 reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our shares of common
        stock and other equity securities
 on Forms 3
 4 and 5
 respectively. Executive officers
 directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.
    


      

        

        



Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us
 or written representations from certain
        reporting persons
 we believe that during fiscal year ended November 30
 2016
 all filing requirements applicable to our officers
 directors and greater than 10% percent beneficial owners were complied with.
    

    
    

that
          applies to our officers
 directors and employees. When we do adopt a code of ethics
 we will disclose it in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
    

    
    

Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a member of its audit committee that qualifies as an &#8220;audit
        committee financial expert&#8221; as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K
 and is &#8220;independent&#8221; as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended.
    

We believe that our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and
        understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an &#8220;audit committee financial expert&#8221; would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our
        circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
 and Director
            Independence
    

The following includes a summary of transactions since the beginning of the November 30
 2018 fiscal year
 or any
        currently proposed transaction
of $120
000 or one percent
        of the average of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years
 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than compensation described under &#8220;Executive Compensation&#8221;). We
        believe the terms obtained or consideration that we paid or received
 as applicable
 in connection with the transactions described below were comparable to terms available or the amounts that would be paid or received
 as applicable
 in
        arm&#8217;s-length transactions.
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

Mark Holcombe
 who is one of three directors of our company
 was our only promoter in the past five fiscal years. Mr.
        Holcombe has not received
 nor will he receive
 anything of value from us
 directly or indirectly in his capacity as promoter. However
 he holds 500
000 or approximately 1.55% of our issued and outstanding common shares.&#160; Additionally
 Mr. Holcombe
        receives fees for his service on our Board of Directors plus fees as a contracted service provider for the Company.&#160; As of November 30
 2018 Mr. Holcombe also has the following options:

We currently act with three directors
 consisting of Mark Holcombe
 Anthony Pallante and Scott Chapman.&#160; Only Scott
        Chapman is independent.
    

We have an Audit Committee
 Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance Committee.
    

However
 all of the members of the committees are not independent. We believe that our board of directors is capable of
        analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The board of directors of our company does not believe that it is necessary to have a completely independent audit
        compensation or corporate governance committee at this time because we believe that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the existing board of directors. Additionally
 we believe that retaining independent directors would
        be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trident Brands Incorporated and its subsidiaries
              (collectively
 the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&#8217; deficit
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to
              as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of their operations and their cash
              flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
          

          
          

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an
              opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the
              Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
          

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
              perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its
              internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
              internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.
          

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
              whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
              evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Trident Brands Incorporated (f/k/a Sandfield Ventures Corp.) (&#8220;we&#8221;
 &#8220;our&#8221;
 &#8220;the Company&#8221;) was incorporated under the
              laws of the State of Nevada on November 5
 2007. The Company was formed to engage in the acquisition
 exploration and development of natural resource properties.
          

The Company is now focused on the development of high growth branded and private label consumer products and
              ingredients within the nutritional supplement
 life sciences and food and beverage categories. The Company is in its early growth stage and has transitioned out of its shell status with the Super-8 filing at the end of August
 2014.
              Activities to date have focused on capital formation
 organizational development and execution of its branded and private label consumer products and ingredients business plan.
          

          
          

Basis of
                  Accounting
          

The Company&#8217;s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a
              November 30
 year-end.
          

Use of Estimates
                  and Assumptions
          

          
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
              disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In accordance with ASC
              No. 250 all adjustments are normal and recurring.
          

Principal of
                  Consolidation
          

The Company consolidated financial statements as of November 30
 2018 include the accounts of Trident Brands
              Incorporated and its subsidiaries: Trident Brands Canada Ltd
 Sports Nutrition Products Inc.
 Brain Armor Inc.
 Trident Sports Nutrition Inc. and Trident Brands International Ltd.
          

Earnings (Loss)
                  Per Share
          

The Company follows the guidance in ASC No. 260
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221;
 which specifies the computation
 presentation
              and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock.
          

Basic net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average
              number of common shares outstanding. Due to net losses during the years ended November 30
 2018 and 2017
 diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as the basic earnings (loss) per share since inclusion of common stock equivalents would
              have been anti-dilutive.
          

          
          

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
              cash equivalents.
          

Accounts
                  Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
          
Accounts receivable are recorded at their original invoice amounts. We regularly review collectability and establish

 2018 and 2017
 the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable was netted against an allowance of $32
383
                and $29
852 respectively.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the
              first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method. We regularly review inventory for obsolete and slow moving inventory and write it off as necessary.
          

Cost Method
                  Investment
          

Our cost method investment consists of an investment in a private company in which we do not have the ability to
              exercise significant influence over its operating and financial activities. The investment is tested for impairment
 at least annually
 and more frequently upon the occurrences of certain events.
          
              
The Company recognized an impairment on
                its cost method investment of $440
542 during the year ended November 30
 2018.
          

          
          
We review our long-lived assets
 including intangible assets subject to amortization
 for recoverability whenever
              events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets (collectively referred to as the asset) may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include
 but are not limited to:
          



                

                    


                    






                

                    


                    






                

                    


                    






                

                    


                    






                

                    


a current expectation that
 more likely than not
 the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before
                        the end of its previously estimated useful life.&#160;




          
We continually evaluate whether such events and circumstances have occurred. When such events or circumstances exist
              the recoverability of the asset's carrying value shall be determined by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows (cash inflows less associated cash outflows) that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct
              result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
          


            

          


              amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life

            
The Company reviews its Indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in
                circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized only if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

          
                
Beneficial
                  Conversion Features
          

The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable
 which is not
              bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion
 is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of
              issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term
the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In
              general
 the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price
 after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction
 if any
 to the fair value of the
              common shares at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.

Fair Value of
                  Financial Instruments
          

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 820
 &#8220;Fair
              Value Measurements and Disclosures&#8221;. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair value
 and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
          

Level 1&#8211; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
              Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in&#160; sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as
              exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities and listed equities.
          

Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either
              directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various
              assumptions
 including&#160; quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market andcontractual prices for the underlying instruments
 as well as other relevant economic measures.
          

Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
              can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest
              rate swaps
 options and collars.
          

Level 3&#8211;Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable fromobjective sources. These
              inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result&#160; in management&#8217;s best estimate of fair value.
          

            nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and note payable. The fair value of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt is estimated based on current rates that would be
            available for debt of similar terms which is not significantly different from its stated value. As of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company&#8217;s
            consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis
 except for a derivative liability
 related to the embedded conversion option on the 2018 convertible note
 with a fair value as of November 30
 2018 of $892
000. The derivative liability was

          

Derivative
                  Financial Instruments
          

Fair value accounting requires
                bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In assessing the convertible debt instruments
 management
                determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt under ASC
                470
 the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments under ASC 815. The Company applies the guidance in ASC 815-40-35-12 to determine the order in which each convertible instrument
                would be evaluated for derivative classification. The Company&#8217;s sequencing policy is to evaluate for reclassification contracts with the earliest inception date first.

The Company markets a range of branded and private label consumer products in the active nutrition and dietary
              supplement categories including Brain Armor&#174; and P2N Peak Performance Nutrition&#174;.
          

Two customers accounted for 90.5% and 5.2% of total revenue
 compared to 94.3% and 3.7% in the prior year. Two
              customers accounted for 59.7% and 17.4% of total accounts receivable
 compared to 82.3% and 16.4% in the prior year.
          

The Company records revenue when all of the following criteria are met: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement with
              the customer exists
 b) the price to the customer is fixed and determinable
 c) product is shipped or delivery is complete (depending on the terms) and d) collection probability is reasonably assured.

Employee
                  Stock-Based Compensation
          

The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC-718
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock
              Compensation&#8221;. ASC-718 requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
 including stock options
 based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize it as
              compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
 usually the vesting period.
          

Non-Employee
                  Stock-Based Compensation:
          

The Company accounts for non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505-50
              &#8220;Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 505-50&#8221;)
 which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as
              the underlying equity instruments vest.
          

          
          

Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740
 Accounting for Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or
              liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
          

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than
              not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company includes interest and
              penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Recent Accounting
                  Pronouncements
          

The Company has evaluated the following recent accounting pronouncements through the date the financial statements
              were issued and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and believe that none of them will have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements:
          

In May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12
&#160;Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope
              Improvements and Practical Expedients.&#160;The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
              services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic
              606
 but instead affect only the narrow aspects noted in Topic 606.&#160;Topic 606 became effective for the Company on December 1
and
              
          
            
In May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
 Scope of Modification
              Accounting. The amendments in this Update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this Update are
              effective for all entities for annual periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December&#160;15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period
 for (1)&#160;public business entities for
              reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2)&#160;all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance.
          

In July 2017
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;)
              No.&#160;2017-11
 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked
              financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity
              classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result
 a freestanding equity-linked financial
              instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments
 the amendments
              require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common
              shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20
 Debt&#8212;Debt with
              Conversion and Other Options)
 including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the
              Codification
 to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
              beginning after December&#160;15
 2018. For all other entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2019
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2020.
              Early adoption is permitted for all entities
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
 any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes
              that interim period.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a
              going concern
 which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with Financial
              Accounting Standards Board
 or the FASB
 Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15
 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 our management evaluates whether there are conditions or events
 considered in
              aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
          

As of November 30
 2018
 the Company had $3
133
303 in cash. However
deficit as of November 30
 2018. The Company&#160; completed additional long term financing with the non-US institutional investor
 receiving proceeds
              of $3
400
780 through the issuance of secured convertible promissory notes. The investor has agreed to make additional investments of $2
804
187 and $3
795
033 ($10
000
000 in the aggregate). Management believes that substantial doubt of our
              ability to meet our obligations for the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued has been alleviated due to
 but not limited to
 i) the approval of new financing available to the Company of up to $10
000
000
 ii)
              continued growth of product sales from our current customer base and new customers
 iii) introduction of higher margin products; and iv) controlling of our expenses. We believe that our present and available financial resources will be
              sufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s obligations and fund our operations at least through the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued.

 own any
              real or personal property. The Company is paying a director $750 per month rent for use of office space and services.
          

          
          

On January 29
 2015
 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a non-US institutional investor
              whereby it agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $2
300
000 of senior secured convertible debentures
 convertible into shares of the company&#8217;s common stock.
          

The Company received $1
800
000 of the funds from the transaction on February 5
 2015. The balance of $500
000 was
              received on May 14

 2017.
          

The convertible debentures are convertible into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an initial conversion price
              of $0.71 per share
 for an aggregate of up to 3
239
437 shares. The debentures originally accrued interest at 6% per annum. On September 26
 2016 the Company entered into an amendment agreement related to these convertible debentures whereby
              the applicable interest rate was increased from 6% to 8% and provisions added to allow the investor to transfer
 sell or hypothecate the convertible notes subject to applicable securities laws. The maturity date of the notes was also extended
              through September 30
 2019. We considered ASC Topic 470-50
 Debt Modifications and Extinguishments
 and determined that the modification was not deemed substantial.
          

          

Due to the note being convertible to common shares of the Company
 a beneficial conversion feature analysis was
              performed. The intrinsic value of the conversion feature was $647
888 which was recognized as debt discount. As of November 30
 2017
 the full amount of the debt discount has been amortized.
          

On September 26
 2016
 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a non-US institutional investor
              pursuant to which
 in consideration for proceeds of $4
100
000
 the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note in the amount of $4
100
000. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement
 the investor has agreed
 from time to time
              after January 1
 2017
 to make additional investments at the Company&#8217;s request of up to $5
900
000 ($10
000
000 in the aggregate) in one or more tranches of not less than one tranche during any 60 day period. The funding of any tranche under
              the agreement (other than the first $4
100
000 which has been funded) is subject to the mutual agreement of the parties as to the use of funds.
          

On May 9
 2017
 the Company received the second tranche of funding with proceeds of $4
400
000 and on May 16
 2018
              the third tranche of $1
500
000 for a total investment by the investor of $10
000
000.
          

The Company used the proceeds of the secured convertible note for general working capital purposes including
              settlement of accounts payable and repayment of mature loans.
          

In consideration of each advance made by the investor pursuant to the securities purchase agreement
 the Company
              issued to the investor a convertible promissory note of equal value


 and bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum. Each
              note is secured in first priority against the present and after acquired assets of the Company and is convertible in whole or in part at the option of the holder into common shares of the Company at a conversion price of $0.60 per share
 for
              an aggregate of up to 16
666

 2017.
          

Due to the notes being convertible to common shares of the Company
 a beneficial conversion feature analysis was
              performed. The intrinsic value of the conversion feature of the notes amounted to $3
333
and was recognized as a debt discount. Amortization of the debt
              discount charged to interest amounted to $1
263
 and $797
 for the
              years ended November 30
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. As of November 30
 2018 and 2017 the unamortized discount amounted to $1
190
 and $1
954
59
 respectively.
          


            

              

              
              
November 30
 2018 and 2017
              

              



On November 30
 2018 the Company and Fengate entered into a Securities Purchase Amendment Agreement pursuant to which
              the Company has agreed to issue to Fengate an additional convertible promissory note (the &#8220;2018 Convertible Note&#8221;) of up to $10
000
000
 subject to certain terms and conditions. Each portion of the principal amount advanced pursuant to the
              2018 Convertible Note will bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and will be payable monthly in arrears to Fengate. Outstanding principal and interest will continue to be secured by the general security agreement dated
              September 26
 2016
 which forms a part of the Agreement. The holder of the note may also elect from time to time to convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal and interest into common shares of the Company at a 25% discount to the
              average closing price of the common shares during the 10 trading days immediately prior to the applicable conversion date. The 2018 Convertible Note will mature on November 30
 2019
 provided that Fengate may unilaterally postpone the
              maturity date to May 31
 2020.
          

On November 30
 2018 the Company received the first tranche of funding with proceeds of $3
400
 tranche of $2
804
187 will be made available to the Company once certain funding conditions have been met while the balance of $3
795
033 shall be funded and issued in one or more tranches within 30 days of receipt of written
                request from the Company.
          

The Company intends to use the proceeds of the secured convertible note for general working capital purposes
              including
 without limitation
 product development
 inventory
 and selling expenses.
          

The Company used the Black-Scholes model to value the embedded conversion
                option at $892
The assumptions used were a discount rate of 2.8%
 volatility of 79.57% and a term of 1.5 years
          

          
          

          
          

On December 23
 2013
 the Company entered into a Deed of Assignment Agreement with Everlast
          

World&#8217;s Boxing Headquarters Corporation
 International Brand Management Limited
 Sports Nutrition Products
              Incorporated and Manchester Capital Incorporated wherein Everlast
 International Brand
 Sports Nutrition and Manchester Capital are parties to a trade mark license and Sports Nutrition
 a New York corporation
 has assigned its interest in the
              trade mark license to the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreement
 Sports Nutrition Products Incorporated
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident Brands Incorporated
 assigned all of its rights
&#160; title
 interest and benefit
              to the trade mark license to the Company effective December 23
 2013 and the Company assumed all of the obligations of Sports Nutrition Products Incorporated under the license agreement. The Company shall remain responsible to Everlast and
              International Brand for all acts and omissions of the subsidiary
 Sports Nutrition Products Inc.
          

The Everlast License Agreement includes a clause stating that Manchester Capital Incorporated will guarantee that the
              Licensee shall perform all of its obligations and duties under the Licence Agreement. If the Licensee defaults in the payment when due of any amount it is obliged to pay to Licensor under the Licence Agreement
 or arising from its
              termination
 Manchester Capital is unconditionally responsible to pay that amount to Licensor in the manner prescribed in the Licence Agreement as if it were the Licensee.

              60% of Direct Response Sales Revenue; in 2014
 8% of Net Retail Sales and 8% of 60% of Direct Response Sales Revenue; in 2015
 9% of Net Retail Sales and 9% of 60% of Direct Response Sales Revenue; in 2016 onwards

              Year's Royalty Calculation or the&#160;previous Year's Annual Minimum Guaranteed Royalty plus 10%
 whichever is greater.

            

              

              
              
November 30
 2018 and 2017
              

              



The agreement was terminated on Dec 31
 2017. On January 17
 2019 Everlast filed a civil lawsuit against the Company.
              In that lawsuit
 Everlast seeks payment under the License Agreement for $425

 2018
          

          
          

The Company may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The
              Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably
              estimated. If any legal matter
 that may arise
 were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#8217;s expectations
 the Company&#8217;s would reflect any potential claim in the consolidated financial
              statements for that reporting period.

As of November 30
 2018
 the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $
          

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that
              deductible temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. As the achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain
 the Company has recorded a valuation allowance.
          

Due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 2018
 the corporate tax rate for those tax years beginning with 2018
              was reduced to 21%.
          

          
          

On March 11
 2019
were amended to extend
                the maturity dates to May 31
 2020.

 &amp;#8220;the Company&amp;#8221;) was incorporated&#13;under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 5
 2007. The Company was formed to engage in the acquisition

 life sciences and food and beverage categories. The Company is in its early growth stage and has transitioned&#13;out of its shell status with the Super-8 filing at the end of August
 2014. Activities to date have focused on capital formation


&#13;which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business within one year&#13;after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
 or the&#13;FASB
 Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15

 our management&#13;evaluates whether there are conditions or events
 considered in aggregate

 2018
 the Company had $3
133
303 in cash. However
 the Company has generated losses and has an accumulated deficit&#13;as of November 30
 2018. The Company&amp;#160; completed additional long term financing with the non-US institutional investor
 receiving&#13;proceeds of $3
400
780 through the issuance of secured convertible promissory notes. The investor has agreed to make additional&#13;investments of $2
804
187 and $3
795
033 ($10
000
000 in the aggregate). Management believes that substantial doubt of our ability&#13;to meet our obligations for the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued has been alleviated due&#13;to
 but not limited to
 i) the approval of new financing available to the Company of up to $10
000
000
 ii) continued growth of&#13;product sales from our current customer base and new customers

000&#13;in cash and 500
000 of our common shares valued at $360
000 based on our stock price on September 6

 Trident International&#13;purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of StreamPak. As a result of the share purchase StreamPak became a&#13;wholly owned subsidiary of Trident International. The acquisition was not deemed an acquisition of a business but rather an acquisition&#13;of a finite-lived intangible asset. The total consideration of $485
000 was recognized as an intangible asset related to intellectual&#13;property with an estimated useful life of 10 years. As of July 31
 2018
 $44
458 was amortized of which $32
333 was amortized&#13;during the current 9 month period and $12
125 in the prior period. The unamortized amount is $440

 entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Packaging Lab&#13;SAS (&amp;#8220;Packaging Lab&amp;#8221;)
 whereby Trident International sold all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of StreamPak
&#13;a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident International
 to Packaging Lab in consideration of 1
000 common shares representing 10%&#13;of fully diluted shares in Packaging Innovation Lab.

The&#13;investment balance of $440
542 was fully impaired as of November 30

The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments&#13;(or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as&#13;liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument&#13;is indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified&#13;instruments. As a result
 a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be&#13;accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity&#13;classified financial instruments
 the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic&#13;260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction&#13;of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS.

 the Company agreed to meet certain conditions
 that when satisfied will have an equivalent value&#13;of $400

 subject to certain terms&#13;and conditions. Each portion of the principal amount advanced pursuant to the 2018 Convertible Note will bear interest at the&#13;rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and will be payable monthly in arrears to Fengate. Outstanding principal and interest will&#13;continue to be secured by the general security agreement dated September 26

Nov. 30
 2018







Basis
of Accounting

The
Company&#8217;s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a November 30
year-end.

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In accordance with ASC No. 250 all adjustments are normal and recurring.

Principal
of Consolidation

The
Company consolidated financial statements as of November 30
 2018 include the accounts of Trident Brands Incorporated and its
subsidiaries: Trident Brands Canada Ltd
 Sports Nutrition Products Inc.
 Brain Armor Inc.
 Trident Sports Nutrition Inc. and Trident
Brands International Ltd.

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share

The
Company follows the guidance in ASC No. 260
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221;
 which specifies the computation
 presentation and
disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock.

Basic
net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Due to net losses during the years ended November 30
 2018 and 2017
 diluted earnings (loss) per share are
the same as the basic earnings (loss) per share since inclusion of common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.

Cash
Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts
receivable are recorded at their original invoice amounts. We regularly review collectability and establish an allowance for uncollectible
amounts as necessary. As of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable was netted against an allowance
of $32
383 and $29
852 respectively.



Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method.
We regularly review inventory for obsolete and slow moving inventory and write it off as necessary.

Cost
Method Investment

Our
cost method investment consists of an investment in a private company in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over its operating and financial activities. The investment is tested for impairment
 at least annually
 and more frequently
upon the occurrences of certain events.

The
Company recognized an impairment on its cost method investment of $440
542 during the year ended November 30
 2018.

Long-Lived
Assets

We
review our long-lived assets
 including intangible assets subject to amortization
 for recoverability whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets (collectively referred
to as &#34;the asset&#34;) may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include
 but are not limited to:



    
a
    significant decrease in the market price of the asset;

    
    

    
a
    significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used;




    
a significant
    change in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;

    
    

    
a current period
    loss combined with projection of continuing loss associated with use of the asset; and




    
a current
    expectation that
 more likely than not
 the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated
    useful life.&#160;


We
continually evaluate whether such events and circumstances have occurred. When such events or circumstances exist
 the recoverability
of the asset's carrying value shall be determined by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows (cash inflows less associated
cash outflows) that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition
of the asset.

Intangible
Assets

Intangible&#160;assets
have either an identifiable or indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their economic or legal life
 whichever is shorter The Company currently does not have any amortizable intangible assets.
The Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks.

The Company
reviews its Indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized only if the carrying amount
exceeds its fair value.

Beneficial
Conversion Features

The
intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable
 which is not bifurcated and accounted
for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion
 is treated as a discount to the
convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using
the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term
the unamortized discount
is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general
 the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing
the effective conversion price
 after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing
transaction
 if any
 to the fair value of the common shares at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures&#8221;. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair value
 and establishes
a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level
1&#8211; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in&#160; sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities
and listed equities.

Level
2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions
 including&#160; quoted forward prices for
commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market andcontractual prices for the underlying instruments
 as well
as other relevant economic measures.

Substantially
all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable
data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category
generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.

Level
3&#8211;Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable fromobjective sources. These inputs may be
used with internally developed methodologies that result&#160; in management&#8217;s best estimate of fair value.

The
carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and note
payable. The fair value of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt is estimated based on current rates that would be available for
debt of similar terms which is not significantly different from its stated value. As of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 the Company
did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance
sheets on a recurring basis
 except for a derivative liability
 related to the embedded conversion option on the 2018 convertible
note
 with a fair value as of November 30
 2018 of $892
000. The derivative liability was fair valued using Level 3 inputs.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

Fair
value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity
instruments and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In assessing the convertible debt instruments
 management
determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion
feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt under ASC 470
 the Company will
continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments under ASC 815. The Company applies the
guidance in ASC 815-40-35-12 to determine the order in which each convertible instrument would be evaluated for derivative classification.
The Company&#8217;s sequencing policy is to evaluate for reclassification contracts with the earliest inception date first.



The
Company markets a range of branded and private label consumer products in the active nutrition and dietary supplement categories
including Brain Armor&#174; and P2N Peak Performance Nutrition&#174;.

Two
customers accounted for 90.5% and 5.2% of total revenue
 compared to 94.3% and 3.7% in the prior year. Two customers accounted
for 59.7% and 17.4% of total accounts receivable
 compared to 82.3% and 16.4% in the prior year.

The
Company records revenue when all of the following criteria are met: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer
exists
 b) the price to the customer is fixed and determinable
 c) product is shipped or delivery is complete (depending on the
terms) and d) collection probability is reasonably assured.

We&#160;
record a reduction to gross sales based on estimated customer returns and allowances.

Cost
of Sales

Cost
of sales includes the direct purchase cost of the product based on the FIFO method.

The Company purchased 97% of its
products from one vendor for the year ended November 30
 2018 and one vendor provided 99% of the Company's products for the year
ended November 30
 2017.

Employee
Stock-Based Compensation

The
Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC-718
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#8221;.
ASC-718 requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
 including
stock options
 based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
 usually the vesting period.

Non-Employee
Stock-Based Compensation:

The
Company accounts for non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505-50
 &#8220;Equity Based
Payments to Non-Employees&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 505-50&#8221;)
 which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their
fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying
equity instruments vest.

Income
Taxes

Income
taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740
 Accounting for Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded
for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit)
results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion
of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes
in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income
taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 the Company had no accrued
interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Related
Parties

A
party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries
 controls
is controlled by
 or is under common control with the Company.

Related
parties also include principal owners of the Company
 its management
 members of the immediate families of principal owners of
the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence
the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully
pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting
parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent
that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related
party.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

The
Company has evaluated the following recent accounting pronouncements through the date the financial statements were issued and
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and believe that none of them will have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s
financial statements:

In
May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12
&#160;Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients.&#160;The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the guidance in Topic
606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments
in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606
 but instead affect only the narrow aspects noted
in Topic 606.&#160;Topic 606 became effective for the Company on December 1
 2018. Management evaluated Topic 606 &#160;and the
modified retrospective adoption of ASU 2016-12 did not have any material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial
statements.

In
May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
 Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments
in this Update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity
to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual periods
and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December&#160;15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including
adoption in any interim period
 for (1)&#160;public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have
not yet been issued and (2)&#160;all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made
available for issuance.

In
July 2017
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;)
No.&#160;2017-11
 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging
(Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments
(or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as
liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument
is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified
instruments. As a result
 a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be
accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity
classified financial instruments
 the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic
260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction
of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down
round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20
Debt&#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options)
 including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of
this Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content
in the Codification
 to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities
 the
amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after
December&#160;15
 2018. For all other entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December&#160;15
 2019
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2020. Early adoption is
permitted for all entities
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business within one year
after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
 or the
FASB
 Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15
 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 our management
evaluates whether there are conditions or events
 considered in aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.

As
of November 30
 2018
 the Company had $3
133
303 in cash. However
 the Company has generated losses and has an accumulated deficit
as of November 30
 2018. The Company&#160; completed additional long term financing with the non-US institutional investor
 receiving
proceeds of $3
400
780 through the issuance of secured convertible promissory notes. The investor has agreed to make additional
investments of $2
804
187 and $3
795
033 ($10
000
000 in the aggregate). Management believes that substantial doubt of our ability
to meet our obligations for the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued has been alleviated due
to
 but not limited to
 i) the approval of new financing available to the Company of up to $10
000
000
 ii) continued growth of
product sales from our current customer base and new customers
 iii) introduction of higher margin products; and iv) controlling
of our expenses. We believe that our present and available financial resources will be sufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s
obligations and fund our operations at least through the next twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued.

On
September 12
 2017 we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement&#160;dated September 6
 2017&#160;among our wholly owned subsidiary
Trident Brands International Ltd. (&#8220;Trident International&#8221;)
 a Bahamas corporation
 StreamPak Ltd. (&#8220;StreamPak&#8221;)
an Anguilla corporation
 and&#160;the sole shareholder of StreamPak
 pursuant to which
 in consideration for the payment of $125
000
in cash and 500
000 of our common shares valued at $360
000 based on our stock price on September 6
 2017
 Trident International
purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of StreamPak. As a result of the share purchase StreamPak became a
wholly owned subsidiary of Trident International. The acquisition was not deemed an acquisition of a business but rather an acquisition
of a finite-lived intangible asset. The total consideration of $485
000 was recognized as an intangible asset related to intellectual
property with an estimated useful life of 10 years. As of July 31
 2018
 $44
458 was amortized of which $32
333 was amortized
during the current 9 month period and $12
125 in the prior period. The unamortized amount is $440
542.

On
July 31
 2018
 our wholly owned subsidiary
 Trident International
 entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Packaging Lab
SAS (&#8220;Packaging Lab&#8221;)
 whereby Trident International sold all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of StreamPak
a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident International
 to Packaging Lab in consideration of 1
000 common shares representing 10%
of fully diluted shares in Packaging Innovation Lab. The investment in Packaging Lab was recorded using the cost method of accounting.
The Company elected to measure the nonmonetary transaction based on the recorded amount of StreamPak using the guidance of ASC
No. 845 &#8220;Non Monetary Transactions&#8221; since it was determined that the transaction lacked commercial substance. The
investment balance of $440
542 was fully impaired as of November 30
 2018.

to which
 in consideration for the issuance of 811
887 of our common shares to Fengate
 we purchased outstanding secured convertible
promissory notes of Mycell Technologies LLC having an aggregate balance due and payable of $511
141 in&#160;principal and $94

 2016
 February 5
 2016
&#160;and May 19
 2016
 bear simple interest on unpaid principal at the rate of ten

of Mycell.&#160;The accrued interest as at November 30
 2018 is $105
869. The Company reserved a full allowance of $617
010 as
of November 30

On
December 22
 2017
 Trident exercised&#160;its option under our Exclusive License Agreement (dated&#160;March 1
 2015) to&#160;purchase
the Brain Armor&#174; brand from DSM Nutrition Products LLC (&#8220;DSM&#8221;). Subsequently
&#160;the&#160;parties have executed
applicable trademark assignment and purchase agreements necessary&#160;to transfer all&#160;global&#160;intellectual property
rights in the Brain Armor brand to&#160;Trident. In lieu of a $400
000USD cash payment to DSM for the value of the Brain Armor&#174;
brand as initially intended
 the Company agreed to meet certain conditions
 that when satisfied will have an equivalent value
of $400
000USD. The costs incurred to meet these conditions are being charged to intangible assets. As of November 30
 2018
 the
Company has recorded $393
580 of costs to the asset account. Of this amount $200
000 will be paid over time as the Company purchases
omega-3 oil from DSM pursuant to its exclusive supply agreement. During the 12 months ended November 30
 2018
 payments of $49
680
were made to DSM in connection with this liability.

On
December 23
 2013
 the Company entered into a Deed of Assignment Agreement with Everlast

World&#8217;s
Boxing Headquarters Corporation
 International Brand Management Limited
 Sports Nutrition Products Incorporated and Manchester
Capital Incorporated wherein Everlast
 International Brand
 Sports Nutrition and Manchester Capital are parties to a trade mark
license and Sports Nutrition
 a New York corporation
 has assigned its interest in the trade mark license to the Company. Pursuant
to the terms of the assignment agreement
 Sports Nutrition Products Incorporated
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident Brands
Incorporated
 assigned all of its rights
&#160; title
 interest and benefit to the trade mark license to the Company effective
December 23
 2013 and the Company assumed all of the obligations of Sports Nutrition Products Incorporated under the license agreement.
The Company shall remain responsible to Everlast and International Brand for all acts and omissions of the subsidiary
 Sports
Nutrition Products Inc.

The
Everlast License Agreement includes a clause stating that Manchester Capital Incorporated will guarantee that the Licensee shall
perform all of its obligations and duties under the Licence Agreement. If the Licensee defaults in the payment when due of any
amount it is obliged to pay to Licensor under the Licence Agreement
 or arising from its termination
 Manchester Capital is unconditionally
responsible to pay that amount to Licensor in the manner prescribed in the Licence Agreement as if it were the Licensee.

The
Royalty Calculation
 as per the terms of the agreement
&#160;are as follows: In 2013
 7% of Net Retail Sales and 7% of 60% of
Direct Response Sales Revenue; in 2014
 8% of Net Retail Sales and 8% of 60% of Direct Response Sales Revenue; in 2015
 9% of
Net Retail Sales and 9% of 60% of Direct Response Sales Revenue; in 2016 onwards

 2019 Everlast filed a civil lawsuit against the Company. In that lawsuit
Everlast seeks payment under the License Agreement for $425
555 in unpaid royalties and interest on the unpaid royalties. The
Company has accrued the unpaid royalties as of November 30
 2018.



The
Company may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records
a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment
required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. If any legal matter
that may arise
 were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#8217;s expectations
the Company&#8217;s would reflect any potential claim in the consolidated financial statements for that reporting period.

Realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences
and carryforwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. As the achievement of required future taxable income

The
Company&#8217;s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a November 30
year-end.




The

make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In accordance with ASC No. 250 all adjustments are normal
and recurring.




The
Company consolidated financial statements as of November 30
 2018 include the accounts of Trident Brands Incorporated and its
subsidiaries: Trident Brands Canada Ltd
 Sports Nutrition Products Inc.
 Brain Armor Inc.
 Trident Sports Nutrition Inc. and Trident
Brands International Ltd.




The
Company follows the guidance in ASC No. 260
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221;
 which specifies the computation
 presentation and
disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock.

Basic
net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Due to net losses during the years ended November 30
 2018 and 2017
 diluted earnings (loss) per share are
the same as the basic earnings (loss) per share since inclusion of common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.




The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.




Accounts
receivable are recorded at their original invoice amounts. We regularly review collectability and establish an allowance for uncollectible
amounts as necessary. As of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable was netted against an allowance
of $32
383 and $29
852 respectively.




Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method.
We regularly review inventory for obsolete and slow moving inventory and write it off as necessary.




Our
cost method investment consists of an investment in a private company in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over its operating and financial activities. The investment is tested for impairment
 at least annually
 and more frequently
upon the occurrences of certain events.

The
Company recognized an impairment on its cost method investment of $440
542 during the year ended November 30
 2018.




We review our long-lived assets
 including intangible
assets subject to amortization
 for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of such long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets (collectively referred to as &#34;the asset&#34;) may not be recoverable.
Such circumstances include
 but are not limited to:



    
    

    
    

    
    




    
    

    
    

    
    




    
a current expectation that
 more likely than not
 the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.&#160;



have occurred. When such events or circumstances exist
 the recoverability of the asset's carrying value shall be determined by
estimating the undiscounted future cash flows (cash inflows less associated cash outflows) that are directly associated with and
that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset.





Intangible&#160;assets have either
an identifiable or indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis
over their economic or legal life
 whichever is shorter The Company currently does not have any amortizable intangible assets.
The Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks.

The Company
reviews its Indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized only if the carrying amount
exceeds its fair value.




The
intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable
 which is not bifurcated and accounted
for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion
 is treated as a discount to the
convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using
the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term
the unamortized discount
is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general
 the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing
the effective conversion price
 after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing
transaction
 if any
 to the fair value of the common shares at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.




The
Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures&#8221;. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair value
 and establishes
a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level
1 &#8211; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in&#160; sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities
and listed equities.

Level
2 &#8211; Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or
indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other
valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions
including&#160; quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual
prices for the underlying instruments
 as well as other relevant economic measures.

Substantially
all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable
data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category
generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.

Level
3 &#8211; Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs
may be used with internally developed methodologies that result&#160; in management&#8217;s best estimate of fair
value.

The
carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and note
payable. The fair value of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt is estimated based on current rates that would be available for
debt of similar terms which is not significantly different from its stated value. As of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 the Company
did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance
sheets on a recurring basis
 except for a derivative liability
 related to the embedded conversion rate
 with a fair value as
of November 30
 2018 of $892
000. The derivative liability was fair valued using Level 3 inputs.




Fair
value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity
instruments and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In assessing the convertible debt instruments
 management
determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion
feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt under ASC 470
 the Company will
continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments under ASC 815. The Company applies the
guidance in ASC 815-40-35-12 to determine the order in which each convertible instrument would be evaluated for derivative classification.
The Company&#8217;s sequencing policy is to evaluate for reclassification contracts with the earliest inception date first.




The
Company markets a range of branded and private label consumer products in the active nutrition and dietary supplement categories
including Brain Armor&#174; and P2N Peak Performance Nutrition&#174;.

Two
customers accounted for 90.5% and 5.2% of total revenue
 compared to 94.3% and 3.7% in the prior year. Two customers accounted
for 59.7% and 17.4% of total accounts receivable
 compared to 82.3% and 16.4% in the prior year.

The
Company records revenue when all of the following criteria are met: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer
exists
 b) the price to the customer is fixed and determinable
 c) product is shipped or delivery is complete (depending on the
terms) and d) collection probability is reasonably assured.

Returns
and allowances are deducted from revenue when received.




Cost of
sales includes the direct purchase cost of the product based on the FIFO method.

The
Company purchased 97% of its products from one vendor for the year ended November 30
 2018 and one vendor provided 99% of the
Company's products for the year ended November 30
 2017.




The
Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC-718
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#8221;.
ASC-718 requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
 including
stock options
 based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
 usually the vesting period.




The
Company accounts for non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505-50
 &#8220;Equity Based
Payments to Non-Employees&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 505-50&#8221;)
 which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their
fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying
equity instruments vest.




Income
taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740
 Accounting for Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded
for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit)
results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion
of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes
in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income
taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 the Company had no accrued
interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.




A
party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries
 controls
is controlled by
 or is under common control with the Company.

Related
parties also include principal owners of the Company
 its management
 members of the immediate families of principal owners of
the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence
the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully
pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting
parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent
that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related
party.




The
Company has evaluated the following recent accounting pronouncements through the date the financial statements were issued and
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and believe that none of them will have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s
financial statements:

In
May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12
&#160;Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients.&#160;The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the guidance in Topic
606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments
in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606
 but instead affect only the narrow aspects noted
in Topic 606.&#160;Topic 606 became effective for the Company on December 1
 2018. Management evaluated Topic 606 &#160;and the
modified retrospective adoption of ASU 2016-12 did not have any material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial
statements.

In
May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
 Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments
in this Update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity
to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual periods
and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December&#160;15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including
adoption in any interim period
 for (1)&#160;public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have
not yet been issued and (2)&#160;all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made
available for issuance.

In
July 2017
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;)
No.&#160;2017-11
 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging
(Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments
(or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as
liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument
is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified
instruments. As a result
 a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be
accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity
classified financial instruments
 the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic
260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction
of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down
round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20
Debt&#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options)
 including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of
this Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content
in the Codification
 to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities
 the
amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after
December&#160;15
 2018. For all other entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December&#160;15
 2019
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2020. Early adoption is
permitted for all entities
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.

Tabular disclosure for stock option plans. Includes
 but is not limited to
 outstanding awards at beginning and end of year
 grants
 exercises
 forfeitures
 and weighted-average grant date fair value.




























Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.
