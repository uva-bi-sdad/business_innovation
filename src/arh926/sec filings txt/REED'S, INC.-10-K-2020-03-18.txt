PART

Item
1. Business



Reed&rsquo;s
Inc.
 a Delaware corporation (&ldquo;Reed&rsquo;s&rdquo;
 the &ldquo;Company
&rdquo; &ldquo;we
&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo; throughout
this report) owns a leading portfolio of handcrafted
 all-natural beverages that is sold in over 30
000 outlets nationwide (including
the natural and specialty food channel
 grocery stores
 mass merchants
 drug stores
 convenience stores
 club stores and on-premise
locations including bars and restaurants). Reed&rsquo;s two core brands are Reed&rsquo;s Craft Ginger Beer and Virgil&rsquo;s
Handcrafted soda. Reed&rsquo;s Craft Ginger Beers are unique due to the proprietary process of using fresh ginger root combined
with a Jamaican inspired recipe of natural spices
 honey and fruit juices. Reed&rsquo;s uses this same handcrafted approach in
its Virgil&rsquo;s line of great tasting
 bold flavored craft sodas
 including its award-winning Virgil&rsquo;s Root Beer.

Reed&rsquo;s
is the leading ginger beer in the US; Virgil&rsquo;s is the leading independent (not aligned with Coca-Cola
 Pepsi or Keurig
Dr. Pepper) all-natural full line craft soda and is ranked fourth in the craft soda category.

Industry
Overview

Reed&rsquo;s
offers its portfolio of natural hand-crafted beverages in the craft specialty foods industry as natural alternatives to the estimated
$90 billion mainstream carbonated soft drinks (&ldquo;CSD&rdquo;) market in the United States. Reed&rsquo;s products are sold
across the country and internationally in the following major channels: natural food
 specialty food
 grocery
 mass merchant
convenience
 club
 drug
 and on-premise bars and restaurants.

While
Reed&rsquo;s is a top-seller in natural food store markets
 it also sells nationally to major grocery chains. Sales growth of
natural food and beverage products is presently outpacing sales growth for conventional products in every region in the United
States. The trend in grocery stores is to expand offerings of natural products. We believe that as we continue to invest our attention
and resources in driving accelerated growth and building our brands
 we will have the ability to scale our business and continue
to build our presence and distribution across all retail channels.


    
    


Carbonated
Soft Drink Industry Overview

The
CSD market continues to be a large category in the overall American consumer beverage industry. According to Chicago-based Mintel
in April 2017
 carbonated soft drinks enjoyed about a 90% household penetration. However
 years of CSD decline (13 years of decline
through 2018 according to Mintel) have resulted in an urgency to innovate within this category. The ginger ale category
has experienced steady CAGR growth of more than 5% over the last 4 years and more than 3% over the latest 52 weeks (based
on SPINS MULO/Natural/Specialty Sales ending 2/23/20. Consumers continue to increasingly embrace ginger ingredients and
ginger products. More consumers are focused on digestive health and are likely opting for the functional and digestive health
benefits of ginger-based beverages. While many consumers clearly still want to indulge in soft drinks
 they are turning to ginger
beverages as a way to impart some health benefits.

The
biggest shift seen over the last decade is a redefinition of what it means to eat and drink healthfully. More consumers are opting
for naturally healthful products touting organic and natural appeals. In addition
 as the craft and natural soda segment is still
underdeveloped at only 1% of the total CSD market
 we believe there is significant growth potential to continue to market and
sell our portfolio of branded products and encourage consumers to switch away from mainstream beverages that contain artificial
colors
 flavors
 sweeteners and preservatives to great tasting natural alternatives.

Consumer
Trends Driving Growth for Our Products

The
following is a list of consumer trends that act as tailwinds as we sell and market our portfolio of ginger beer and handcrafted
beverages:



    
    
Growing
    Consumer Interest in Better-for-You and Healthier Products
 consumers reported that &lsquo;healthy
    options
&rsquo; followed by &lsquo;natural ingredients&rsquo; were the two top factors when considering purchasing new products.

    
    
    

    
    
Reducing
    Sugar and Artificial Sweeteners

    
    
    

    
    
Authentic
    and Distinct Brands
 cross-generational appeal (Millennials and Boomers alike) for brands with an authentic
    story
 proprietary processes
 higher quality ingredients and unique packaging.

    
    
    

    
    
Trading
    up to Premium and Craft
    for small batch
 handcrafted brands that offer higher quality products and authentic bold flavors.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    Craft Soda Category is Underdeveloped
    beverage categories; it is currently less than 1% of the overall CSD category while craft beer accounts for over 20% of the
    total beer category.

    
    
    

    
    
Ginger
    Use in Beverages is Growing: 
 and we believe its momentum will continue.

    
    
    

    
    
Growth
    in Non-Alcoholic Alternatives (Mocktails) in On-Premise
    and unique flavors when they go out to bars and restaurants.

    
    
    

    
    
Demand
    for Premium Mixed Drinks
 growing 30% year
    over year in on-premise sales. They are now in the top five most popular cocktails in the United States according to both
    Nielsen and Cheers Magazine.


Our
strategies will remain responsive to these macro consumer trends as we concentrate our efforts on developing the Company&rsquo;s
sales and marketing functions.


    
    


Our
Products

Our
hand-crafted natural beverages use only premium natural ingredients. Our products are free of genetically modified organisms (&ldquo;GMOs&rdquo;)
and are gluten free. Over the years
 Reed&rsquo;s has developed several product offerings. In 2019
 we streamlined our
focus to our core product offerings of Reed&rsquo;s Craft Ginger Beer and Virgil&rsquo;s Craft Sodas and launched a new line of
Virgil&rsquo;s Zero Sugar Sodas in twelve ounce cans.

Reed&rsquo;s
Craft Ginger Beer

Reed&rsquo;s
Craft Ginger Beer is distinguished from other ginger beers by its proprietary process of brewing fresh ginger root
 its exclusive
use of all-natural ingredients
 and its authentic Jamaican-inspired recipe. We do not use preservatives
 artificial flavors
 or
colors
 and our Ginger Beer is certified kosher. We offer different levels of fresh ginger content
 ranging from our lightest-spiced
Original
 to our medium-spiced Extra
 and finally to our spiciest Strongest. We also offer two sweetener options: one with cane
sugar
 honey and fruit juices and another without sugar (Zero Sugar) made from an innovative blend of natural sweeteners (developed
in 2018 and commercialized in 2019).

As
of the end of 2019
 the Reed&rsquo;s Craft Ginger Beer line included four major varieties in restaged packaging:



    
    
Reed&rsquo;s
    Original Ginger Beer &ndash;

                                         uses a proprietary natural sweetening system that has no added sugars.



Virgil&rsquo;s
Handcrafted Sodas

Virgil&rsquo;s
is a premium handcrafted soda that uses only all-natural ingredients to create bold renditions of classic flavors. We don&rsquo;t
use any preservatives
 any artificial colors
 or any GMO-sourced ingredients
 and our Virgil&rsquo;s line is certified kosher.

The
Virgil&rsquo;s line includes the following products:

Handcrafted

root beer ever produced and has since won numerous awards. Virgil&rsquo;s difference is using all-natural ingredients to craft
bold
 classic soda flavors. Virgil&rsquo;s Handcrafted line includes Root Beer

Our
Primary Markets

Our
Distribution Network

Our
products are brought to market through an extremely flexible and fluid hybrid distribution model
 which is a mix of direct-store-delivery
customer warehouse
 and distributor networks. The distribution system used depends on customer needs
 product characteristics
and local trade practices.

Our
product reaches the market in the following ways:

Direct
to Natural &amp; Specialty Wholesale Distributors

Our
natural and specialty distributor partners operate a distribution network delivering thousands of SKUs of natural and gourmet
products to thousands of small
 independent
 natural retail outlets around the U.S.
 along with national chain customers
 both
conventional and natural. This system of distribution allows our brands far reaching access to some of the most remote parts of
North America.

Direct
to Store Distribution (&ldquo;DSD&rdquo;) Through Non-Alcoholic Beverage Distributor Network

Our
independent distributor partners operate DSD systems which deliver primarily beverages
 foods
 and snacks directly to retail stores
where the products are merchandised by their route sales and field sales employees. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum
visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products frequently restocked and responds to in-store promotion and merchandising.


    
    


Direct
to Store Warehouse Distribution

Some
of our products are delivered from our co-packers and warehouses directly to customer warehouses. Some retailers mandate we deliver
directly to them
 as it is more cost effective and allows them to pass savings along to their customers. Other retailers may not
mandate direct delivery
 but they recommend and prefer it as they have the capability to self-distribute and can realize significant
savings with direct delivery.

Wholesale
Distribution

Our
Wholesale Distributor network handles the wholesale shipments of our products. These distributors have a warehouse and distribution
center
 and ship Reed&rsquo;s and Virgil&rsquo;s products directly to the retailer (or to customers who opt for drop shipping).

International
Distribution

We
presently export Reed&rsquo;s and Virgil&rsquo;s brands throughout international markets via US based exporters. Some markets
where you&rsquo;ll find our brands present are France
 UK
 South Africa
 portions of the Caribbean
 Canada
 Spain
 Philippines
Israel and Australia. In the UK
 our Virgil&rsquo;s brands can be found at Pizza Hut
 Tesco Supermarket and Sainsbury.

International
sales to some areas of the world are cost prohibitive
 except for some specialty sales
 since our premium sodas were historically
packed in glass
 which drives substantial freight costs when shipping overseas. Despite these cost challenges
 we believe there
are good opportunities to expand internationally and we are increasing our marketing focus on these areas by adding freight friendly
packages such as aluminum cans. We are open to exporting and co-packing internationally and expanding our brands into foreign
markets
 and we have held preliminary discussions with trading companies and import/export companies for the distribution of our
products throughout Asia
 Europe
 Australia
 and South America. We believe these areas are a natural fit for Reed&rsquo;s ginger
products because of the popularity and importance of ginger in international markets
 especially the Asian market
 where ginger
is a significant part of the local diet and nutrition.

We
believe the strength of our brands
 innovation
 and marketing
 coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our
distribution network
 allows us to compete effectively.

Distribution
Agreements

We
have entered into agreements with some of our distributors that commit us to &ldquo;termination fees&rdquo; if we terminate our
agreements early or without cause. These agreements provide for our distributor partners to have the right to distribute
our products to a defined type of retailer within a defined geographic region. As is customary in the beverage industry
 if we
should terminate the agreement or not automatically renew the agreement
 we would be obligated to make certain payments to our
distributor partners. We constantly review our distribution agreements with our partners across North America.

Some
of our outside distributors are not bound by written agreements with us and may discontinue their relationship with us on short
notice. Most distributors handle a number of competitive products. In addition
 our products are sometimes a small part
of our distributors&rsquo; businesses.



Nonalcoholic
Beverages

The
nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry is highly competitive
 consisting of numerous companies ranging
from small or emerging to very large and well established. The principal areas of competition include pricing
 packaging
 development
of new products and flavors
 and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively
large number of manufacturers. Many of these brands have enjoyed broad
 well-established national recognition for years
 through
well-funded ad and other branding campaigns. Competitors in the ginger beer category include Goslings
 Fever Tree
 Bundaberg
Cock &lsquo;n Bull and Q Tonic; in the craft soda category we compete with brands such as Stewart&rsquo;s
 IBC
 Zevia
 Blue Sky
Hansen&rsquo;s
 Henry Weinhard&rsquo;s
 Boylan
 and Jones Soda; In the Ginger Ale category we compete with Canada Dry
 Schweppes
Seagram&rsquo;s and Zevia.


    
    


Important
factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of products
 trade and consumer promotions
rapid and effective development of new
 unique cutting-edge products
 attractive and different packaging
 branded product advertising
and pricing. We also compete for distributors who will concentrate on marketing our products over those of our competitors
 provide
stable and reliable distribution
 and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the soft drink category
could also cause our products to be unable to gain or even lose market share
 or we could experience price erosion.

Despite
our products having a relatively high price for a craft premium beverage product
 minimal mass media advertising to date
 and
a small but growing presence in the mainstream market compared to many of our competitors
 we believe our all-natural innovative
beverage recipes
 packaging
 use of premium ingredients
 and a proprietary ginger processing formula provide us with a competitive
advantage. Our commitments to the highest quality standards and brand innovation are keys to our success.

Shot
Category 

Our
ready Wellness Ginger Shot will be entering the energy shot category that many companies have already entered. A few mainstream
companies drive the shelf stable category
 but there is room for an all-natural alternative. Competition for market share and
acceptance of new products is significant. Main competitors are 5-Hour Energy
 Ginger Time
 and Rescue Ginger Shots.

Candy


Reed&rsquo;s
Craft Ginger is at the beginning of its restage. The category is small and there isn&rsquo;t a significant number of entrants.
Key competition are Chimes and Gin Gins.

Manufacturing
Our Products

Now
100% of Reed&rsquo;s product is produced by our co-pack partners
 which assemble our products and charge us a fee
 generally by
the case
 for the products produced. We have a long-standing relationship with a co-packer in Pennsylvania and
recently engaged an additional co-packer on the East Coast. Additionally
 in conjunction with the sale of our plant
 we entered
into a three-year co-packing agreement with CCB
 whereby CCB will produce Reed&rsquo;s Inc. beverages in glass bottles at prevailing
West Coast market rates. During the first quarter of 2019
 we also entered into a one-year co-packing agreement with Sonoma Beverage
Company
 also on the West Coast. We are in discussion and negotiations with additional co-packers to secure added capability
for future production needs. We periodically review our co-packing relationships to ensure that they are optimal with respect
to quality of production
 cost and location.

Raw
Materials



Substantially
all of the raw materials used in the preparation
 bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by Reed&rsquo;s or by our
contract packers in accordance with our specifications.

Generally
the raw materials used in our products are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers and many of the materials have multiple
reliable suppliers. This provides a level of protection against a major supply constriction or adverse cost or supply impacts.
Since our raw materials are common ingredients and supply is easily accessible
 we have few long-term contracts in place with
our suppliers.


    
    


A
significant component of our product cost is the purchase of glass bottles and aluminum cans. In December 2017
 we entered into
an exclusive strategic partnership with Owens-Illinois (glass)
 and in February 2018 we entered into a strategic partnership with
Crown Cork &amp; Seal for aluminum cans. Both suppliers provide expertise in emerging package and material innovation that
can be leveraged to further expand marketing and package offerings.



As
part of our ongoing initiative to simplify and streamline operations
 we have identified approximately thirty-five core products
on which to place our strategic focus. These core products consist of Reed&rsquo;s and Virgil&rsquo;s branded beverages
 which
accounted for approximately 96% of sales in 2019. Product innovation within these two major lines remains a top
priority.

Warehousing
and Distribution

Warehousing
and Logistics are a significant portion of the Company&rsquo;s operational costs. In order to drive efficiency and reduce costs
on February 1
 2019 we entered into a strategic partnership with Veritiv Logistics Solutions to manage all freight movement for
the Company. Veritiv is one of the largest distribution service providers in North America and has expertise that will provide
a competitive advantage in the movement of raw materials and finished goods. This partnership will support planning and execution
of all inventory movement
 assessment of storage needs and cost management.

We
follow a &ldquo;fill as needed&rdquo; model to the best of our ability and have no significant order backlog.

New
Product Development

While
we have simplified our business and have streamlined a significant number of SKUs in order to further our primary objective of
accelerating the growth of the Reed&rsquo;s and Virgil&rsquo;s core product offerings
 we believe significant opportunity remains
in the all-natural beverage space. Healthier alternatives will be the future for carbonated soft drinks. We will continue to drive
product development in the all-natural
 no and low sugar offerings in the &ldquo;better for you&rdquo; beverage categories. In
addition
 we believe there are powerful consumer trends that will help propel the growth of our brand portfolio including the
increased consumption of ginger as a recognized superfood
 the growing use of ginger beer in today&rsquo;s popular cocktail drinks
and consumers&rsquo; increased demand for higher quality
 all-natural handcrafted beverages.

Chris
Reed
 the Company&rsquo;s founder and Chief Innovation Officer continues to support our new product development efforts in 2020.
Mr. Reed possesses thirty years of product development and innovation experience. Recent innovations include our compelling line
of full flavor
 all-natural
 zero sugar
 zero calorie sodas. Reed&rsquo;s has also begun to expand and broaden its product development
capabilities by engaging and working with larger
 experienced beverage flavor houses and innovative ingredient research and supply
companies.


    
    


We
believe our new business model enhances our ability to be nimble and innovative
 producing category leading new products in a
short period of time




We
have entered into a licensing agreement with Full Sail Brewery headquartered in Hood River
 Oregon to manufacture and sell our
new line of Reed&rsquo;s Alcoholic Moscow Mule in 4 pack cans. Full Sail will manage all aspects of production and distribution.



Sales
of our nonalcoholic beverages are somewhat seasonal with a higher than average volume in the warmer months. The volume of sales
in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.

Proprietary
Rights

We
own copyrights
 trademarks and trade secrets relating to our products and the processes for their production; the packages used
for our products; and the design and operation of various processes and equipment used in our business. Some of our proprietary
rights are licensed to our co-packers and suppliers and other parties. Reed&rsquo;s ginger processing and brewing process
 finished
beverage products and concentrate formulas are among its most valuable trade secrets.

We
own trademarks in the United States that we consider material to our business. Trademarks in the United States are valid as long
as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our manufacturing and bottling agreements
we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Reed&rsquo;s trademarks in connection with their manufacture
 sale and distribution
of our products. We intend to obtain trademarks in international markets as may become necessary.

We
use confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees
 manufacturers and distributors to protect our proprietary rights.
Mr. Reed is also subject to an intellectual property agreement with Reed&rsquo;s restricting competition consistent with his fiduciary
obligations to Reed&rsquo;s.





The
production
 distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic
Act
 the Federal Trade Commission Act
 the Lanham Act
 state consumer protection laws
 competition laws
 federal
 state and local
workplace health and safety laws
 various federal
 state and local environmental protection laws
 and various other federal
 state
and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production
 transportation
 sale
 safety
 advertising
 labeling and ingredients
of such products. Outside the United States
 the distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject
to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.

A
California law known as Proposition 65 requires a specific warning to appear on any product containing a component listed by the
state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds
other substances to these lists. Proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide
warnings on their products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold below
which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently
 the detection of even a trace amount
of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However
 Proposition 65 does not
require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity
of a listed substance that is:



    
    
below
    a &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; threshold that may be established;

    
    
naturally
    occurring;

    
    
the
    result of necessary cooking; or

    
    
subject
    to another applicable exemption.



    
    


No
Company beverages produced for sale in California are currently required to display warnings under this law. We are unable to
predict whether a component found in a Company product might be added to the California list in the future
 although the state
has initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine and other natural occurring substances will be evaluated for listing. Furthermore
we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology may become applicable under
this law and related regulations as they currently exist
 or as they may be amended
 might result in the detection of an infinitesimal
quantity of a listed substance in a beverage of ours produced for sale in California.

Bottlers
of our beverage products presently offer and use non-refillable
 recyclable containers in the United States. Some of these bottlers
also offer and use refillable containers
 which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the
United States and overseas requiring deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for the sale
 marketing and use of certain non-refillable
beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit
recycling
 tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and
overseas. We anticipate additional
 similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local
 state and federal
levels
 both in the United States and elsewhere.

All
of our facilities and other operations in the United States are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations
including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such
legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had
 and we do not expect such compliance to have
 any material adverse
effect on our capital expenditures
 net income or competitive position.

Environmental
Matters

Our
primary cost pertaining to environmental compliance activity is in recycling fees and redemption values. We are required to collect
redemption values from our customers and remit those redemption values to the state
 based upon the number of bottles or cans
of certain products sold in the state.

Our
Employees

As
of December 31
 2019
 we have 28 full-time equivalent employees on our corporate staff.


    
    


We
employ additional people on a part-time basis as needed. We have never participated in a collective bargaining agreement. We believe
relations with our employees are good.

Item
1A. Risk Factors

The
following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented
in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent
those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us
or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.
All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof
 and we assume
no obligations to update any such forward-looking statements.

Risks
Relating to Our Business

We
have a history of operating losses.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company recorded a net loss of $16
112 and used cash in operations of $18
161. As
of December 31
 2019
 we had a cash balance of $913 with borrowing capacity of $3
235
 stockholders&rsquo; equity of $1
147 and
a working capital of $4
885
 compared to a cash balance of $624
 stockholder&rsquo;s deficit of $6
743 and working capital shortfall
of $3
297 at December 31
 2018.

During
the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company experienced significant financing shortages and engaged
in two separate transactions to raise capital in 2019. Recently
 the Company received net proceeds of $14
867
257
from an underwritten offering of common stock in February 2019 and $7
474
441 from an underwritten offering of common stock
in October 2019.


    
    


If
we continue to suffer losses from operations
 our working capital may be insufficient to support our ability to expand our business
operations as rapidly as we would deem necessary at any time
 unless we are able to obtain additional financing. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms
 or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms
 we may not be able to pursue our business objectives and would be required to reduce
our level of operations
 including reducing infrastructure
 promotions
 sales and marketing programs
 personnel and other operating
expenses. These events could adversely affect our business
 results of operations and financial condition. If adequate funds are
not available or if they are not available on acceptable terms
 our ability to fund the growth of our operations
 take advantage
of opportunities
 develop products or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures
 could be significantly limited.

We
may need additional financing in the future
 which may not be available when needed or may be costly and dilutive.

We
may require additional financing to support our working capital needs in the future. The amount of additional capital we may require
the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors
 including
our strategic initiatives and operating plans
 the performance of our business and the market conditions for debt or equity financing.
Additionally
 the amount of capital required will depend on our ability to meet our case sales goals and otherwise successfully
execute our operating plan. We believe it is imperative to meet these sales objectives in order to lessen our reliance on external
financing in the future. Although we believe various debt and equity financing alternatives will be available to us to support
our working capital needs
 financing arrangements on acceptable terms may not be available to us when needed. Additionally
 these
alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders.
Any such financing alternatives may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements. If necessary
we may explore strategic transactions that we consider to be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders
 which may
include
 without limitation
 public or private offerings of debt or equity securities
 and other strategic alternatives; however
these options may not ultimately be available or feasible.

Our
indebtedness and liquidity needs could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.

Our
existing indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth
 and we may have difficulty making debt service
payments on such indebtedness as payments become due. We may also experience the occurrence of events of default or breach of
financial covenants. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate
 our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired.
If we violate any of the restrictions or covenants
 a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable
our lenders&rsquo; commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have
 or be able to obtain
 sufficient funds
to make these accelerated payments.

Our
secured credit facility with Rosenthal and Rosenthal
 Inc. contains financial covenants that
 if breached
 could trigger default.

Pursuant
to our Financing Agreement with Rosenthal &amp; Rosenthal
 Inc. (&ldquo;Rosenthal&rdquo;) dated October 4
 2018 for our secured
credit facility
 we are required to maintain at the end of each of our fiscal quarters
 tangible net worth in an amount not less
than negative $1
500
000 and working capital of not less than negative $2
500
000. We did not meet these requirements for the
fiscal quarter ended December 31
 2018
 and Rosenthal waived compliance with these covenants for this period for a $5
000 fee.
We have been in compliance since. Any breach that is not waived by Rosenthal could trigger default.


The
recent global coronavirus outbreak could harm our business and results of operations.

In
March 2020 the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak
 which
has continued to spread
 and any related adverse public health developments
 has adversely affected workforces
 customers
 economies
and financial markets globally
 potentially leading to an economic downturn. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many
businesses
 including ours. This outbreak could decrease spending
 adversely affect demand for our product and harm our business
and results of operations. It is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak
and its effects on our business or results of operations at this time.

Disruption
within our supply chain
 contract manufacturing or distribution channels could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial
condition and results of operations.

Our
ability
 through our suppliers
 business partners
 contract manufacturers
 independent distributors and retailers
 to produce
transport
 distribute and sell products is critical to our success.

Damage
or disruption to our suppliers or to manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather
 natural disaster
 fire or explosion
terrorism
 pandemics such as COVD-19 and influenza
 labor strikes or other reasons
 could impair the manufacture
 distribution
and sale of our products. Many of these events are outside of our control. Failure to take adequate steps to protect against or
mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events
 or to effectively manage such events if they occur
 could adversely
affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.


    
    


Our
reliance on distributors
 retailers and brokers could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market our
products
 maintain our existing markets and expand our business into other geographic markets.

Our
ability to maintain and expand our existing markets for our products
 and to establish markets in new geographic distribution
areas
 is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with reliable distributors
 retailers and
brokers strategically positioned to serve those areas. Most of our distributors
 retailers and brokers sell and distribute competing
products and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses. The success of this network will depend on the performance
of the distributors
 retailers and brokers of this network. There is a risk that the mentioned entities may not adequately perform
their functions within the network by
 without limitation
 failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products
in localities that may not be receptive to our product. Our ability to incentivize and motivate distributors to manage and sell
our products is affected by competition from other beverage companies who have greater resources than we do. To the extent that
our distributors
 retailers and brokers are distracted from selling our products or do not employ sufficient efforts in managing
and selling our products
 including re-stocking the retail shelves with our products
 our sales and results of operations could
be adversely affected. Furthermore
 such third-parties&rsquo; financial position or market share may deteriorate
 which could
adversely affect our distribution
 marketing and sales activities.

Our
ability to maintain and expand our distribution network and attract additional distributors
 retailers and brokers will depend
on a number of factors
 some of which are outside our control. Some of these factors include:



    
    
the
    level of demand for our brands and products in a particular distribution area;

    
    
    

    
    
our
    ability to price our products at levels competitive with those of competing products; and

    
    
    

    
    
our
    ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by distributors
 retailers and brokers.


We
may not be able to successfully manage all or any of these factors in any of our current or prospective geographic areas of distribution.
Our inability to achieve success with regards to any of these factors in a geographic distribution area will have a material adverse
effect on our relationships in that particular geographic area
 thus limiting our ability to maintain or expand our market
 which
will likely adversely affect our revenues and financial results.

We
incur significant time and expense in attracting and maintaining key distributors.

Our
marketing and sales strategy depends in large part on the availability and performance of our independent distributors. We currently
do not have
 nor do we anticipate in the future that we will be able to establish
 long-term contractual commitments from some
of our distributors. We may not be able to maintain our current distribution relationships or establish and maintain successful
relationships with distributors in new geographic distribution areas. Moreover
 there is the additional possibility that we may
have to incur additional expenditures to attract and maintain key distributors in one or more of our geographic distribution areas
in order to profitably exploit our geographic markets.

If
we lose any of our key distributors or national retail accounts
 our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

We
depend in large part on distributors to distribute our beverages and other products. Some of our outside distributors are not
bound by written agreements with us and may discontinue their relationship with us on short notice. Some distributors handle a
number of competitive products. In addition
 our products are a small part of our distributors&rsquo; businesses.


    
    


We
continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into distribution arrangements with regional bottlers or other
direct store delivery distributors having established sales
 marketing and distribution organizations. Many of our distributors
are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. In many
cases
 such products compete directly with our products.

The
marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing
distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional distributors
 and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products
above the products of our competitors
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

It
is difficult to predict the timing and amount of our sales because our distributors are not required to place minimum orders with
us.

Our
independent distributors and national accounts are not required to place minimum monthly or annual orders for our products. In
order to reduce their inventory costs
 independent distributors typically order products from us on a &ldquo;just in time&rdquo;
basis in quantities and at such times based on the demand for the products in a particular distribution area. Accordingly
 we
cannot predict the timing or quantity of purchases by any of our independent distributors or whether any of our distributors will
continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they may have done in the past. Additionally
 our
larger distributors and partners may make orders that are larger than we have historically been required to fill. Shortages in
inventory levels
 supply of raw materials or other key supplies could negatively affect us.

If
we do not adequately manage our inventory levels
 our operating results could be adversely affected.

We
need to maintain adequate inventory levels to be able to deliver products to distributors on a timely basis. Our inventory supply
depends on our ability to correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise
particularly for new products
 seasonal promotions and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or
are unable to maintain sufficient inventory of raw materials
 we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If
we overestimate distributor or retailer demand for our products
 we may end up with too much inventory
 resulting in higher storage
costs
 increased trade spending and the risk of inventory spoilage. If we fail to manage our inventory to meet demand
 we could
damage our relationships with our distributors and retailers and could delay or lose sales opportunities
 which would unfavorably
impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. In addition
 if the inventory of our products held by our
distributors and retailers is too high
 they will not place orders for additional products
 which would also unfavorably impact
our sales and adversely affect our operating results.

Our
dependence on independent contract manufacturers could make management of our manufacturing and distribution efforts inefficient
or unprofitable.

We
are expected to arrange for our contract manufacturing needs sufficiently in advance of anticipated requirements
 which is customary
in the contract manufacturing industry for comparably sized companies. Based on the cost structure and forecasted demand for the
particular geographic area where our contract manufacturers are located
 we continually evaluate which of our contract manufacturers
to use. To the extent demand for our products exceeds available inventory or the production capacity of our contract manufacturing
arrangements
 or orders are not submitted on a timely basis
 we will be unable to fulfill distributor orders on demand. Conversely
we may produce more product inventory than warranted by the actual demand for it
 resulting in higher storage costs and the potential
risk of inventory spoilage. Our failure to accurately predict and manage our contract manufacturing requirements and our inventory
levels may impair relationships with our independent distributors and key accounts
 which
 in turn
 would likely have a material
adverse effect on our ability to maintain effective relationships with those distributors and key accounts.

Increases
in costs of packaging
 ingredients and contract manufacturing tolling fees may have an adverse impact on our gross margin.

Over
the past few years
 costs of organic and natural ingredients have increased due to increased demand and required the Company to
obtain these ingredients from a wider population of qualified vendors. Packaging costs such as paper and aluminum cans have experienced
industry wide price increases in the past and there is always the risk that the company&rsquo;s co-packers increase their toll
rates based on increases in their fixed and variable costs. If the Company is unable to pass on these costs
 the gross margin
will be significantly impacted.


    
    


Increased
market spending may not drive volume growth

The
Company&rsquo;s marketing efforts in the past have been limited. The current increase in marketing spending may not generate an
increase in sales volume resulting in a net decrease in gross revenue.

Increases
in costs of energy and freight may have an adverse impact on our gross and operating margins.

Over
the past few years
 volatility in the global oil markets has resulted in high fuel prices
 which many shipping companies have
passed on to their customers by way of higher base pricing and increased fuel surcharges. With recent declines in fuel prices
some companies have been slow to pass on decreases in their fuel surcharges. If fuel prices increase again
 we expect to experience
higher shipping rates and fuel surcharges
 as well as energy surcharges on our raw materials. It is hard to predict what will
happen in the fuel markets in 2020. Due to the price sensitivity of our products
 we may not be able to pass such increases
on to our customers.

If
we are unable to attract and retain key personnel
 our efficiency and operations would be adversely affected.

Our
success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees in such areas as sales
 marketing
 product development
supply chain
 finance and accounting. In general
 we compete to hire new employees
 and
 in some cases
 must train them and develop
their skills and competencies. Our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition
for employees
 higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any unplanned turnover
 particularly involving our
key personnel
 could negatively impact our operations
 financial condition and employee morale.

If
we fail to protect our trademarks and trade secrets
 we may be unable to successfully market our products and compete effectively.

We
rely on a combination of trademark and trade secrecy laws
 confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our brand and our reputation
 and adversely
affect our ability to compete effectively. Further
 enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights
 including our trademarks
copyrights
 licenses and trade secrets
 could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We
regard our intellectual property
 particularly our trademarks and trade secrets
 to be of considerable value and importance to
our business and our success
 and we actively pursue the registration of our trademarks in the United States and internationally.
However
 the steps taken by us to protect these proprietary rights may not be adequate and may not prevent third parties from
infringing or misappropriating our trademarks
 trade secrets or similar proprietary rights. In addition
 other parties may seek
to assert infringement claims against us
 and we may have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. Any
such claim or litigation could be costly. In addition
 any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of
infringement by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market or sell our brands
 profitably exploit
our products or recoup our associated research and development costs.

Litigation
or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.

We
may become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings. Litigation involves significant risks
 uncertainties and costs
 including
distraction of management attention away from our business operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to
assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate
 if possible
 the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments
and estimates
 we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings
 as appropriate. These assessments
and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management
judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our
policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable
to our business operations
 including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. Nonetheless
 our policies and
procedures may not ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct
by our employees or agents could damage our reputation or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or
criminal penalties
 including substantial monetary fines
 as well as disgorgement of profits.

We
are subject to risks inherent in sales of products in international markets.

Our
operations outside of the United States contribute to our revenue and profitability
 and we believe that developing and emerging
markets present important future growth opportunities for us. However
 there can be no assurance that existing or new products
that we manufacture
 distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular foreign market
 due to local or global
competition
 product price
 cultural differences
 consumer preferences or otherwise. Here are many factors that could adversely
affect demand for our products in foreign markets
 including our inability to attract and maintain key distributors in these markets;
volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets; changes in economic
 political or social conditions
 imposition
of new or increased labeling
 product or production requirements
 or other legal restrictions; restrictions on the import or export
of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; inflationary currency
 devaluation or fluctuation; increased
costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations. If we are unable to effectively
operate or manage the risks associated with operating in international markets
 our business
 financial condition or results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Changes
in accounting standards and subjective assumptions
 estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters
could significantly affect our financial results.

The
United States generally accepted accounting principles and related pronouncements
 implementation guidelines and interpretations
with regard to a wide variety of matters that are relevant to our business
 such as
 but not limited to
 stock-based compensation
trade spend and promotions
 and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions
 estimates and judgments
by our management. Changes to these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions
 estimates or judgments
by our management could significantly change our reported results.


    
    



We
have identified material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If
not remediated
 our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial
obligations
 each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common
stock.

Maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to produce
reliable financial statements. As discussed in Item 9A &ndash; &ldquo;Controls and Procedures&rdquo; of this Form 10-K
 we have
re-evaluated our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they
were not effective as of December 31
 2019.

A
material weakness is defined as a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses we identified are (1) ineffective controls over outsourced IT
systems and business processes and (2) inadequate segregation of duties within accounting processes. 

The
Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses as promptly as possible. Implementation of the Company&rsquo;s remediation
plans has commenced and is being overseen by the audit committee. However
 there can be no assurance as to when these material
weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Even effective internal control
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Any failure
to remediate the material weaknesses
 or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting

 which in turn could

meet our financial reporting obligations.

If
we are unable to build and sustain proper information technology infrastructure
 our business could suffer.

We
depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers
as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary
to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure
 we could be subject to transaction errors
 processing inefficiencies
the loss of customers
 business disruptions
 or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches.

We
could be subject to cybersecurity attacks.

Cybersecurity
attacks are evolving and include malicious software
 attempts to gain unauthorized access to data
 and other electronic security
breaches that could lead to disruptions in business processes
 unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information
and corruption of data. Such unauthorized access could subject us to operational interruption
 damage to our brand image and private
data exposure
 and harm our business.

Risks
Factors Relating to Our Industry

The
current aluminum can shortage could harm our ability to meet consumer demand.

As
a craft beverage company
 we do not meet volume requirements to have a contract in place with our aluminum can supplier. Craft
beverage companies such as us are facing an aluminum can shortage for certain sizes. While standard 12 ounce can supply is not
in short supply
 we will continue to see supply issues with non-standard cans such as slim cans in 8
 10
 and 12 ounces. This
aluminum can shortage could harm our ability to timely produce enough product to meet consumer demand.

We
may experience a reduced demand for some of our products due to health concerns (including obesity) and legislative initiatives
against sweetened beverages.

Consumers
are concerned about health and wellness; public health officials and government officials are increasingly vocal about obesity
and its consequences. There has been a trend among some public health advocates and dietary guidelines to recommend a reduction
in sweetened beverages
 as well as increased public scrutiny
 potential new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages
 and additional
governmental regulations concerning the marketing and labeling/packing of the beverage industry. Additional or revised regulatory
requirements
 whether labeling
 tax or otherwise
 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. Further
 increasing public concern with respect to sweetened beverages could reduce demand for our beverages and
increase desire for more low-calorie soft drinks
 water
 enhanced water
 coffee-flavored beverages
 tea
 and beverages with natural
sweeteners. We are continuously working to launch new products that round out our diversified portfolio.

Legislative
or regulatory changes that affect our products could reduce demand for products or increase our costs.

Taxes
imposed on the sale of certain of our products by federal
 state and local governments in the United States
 Canada or other countries
in which we operate could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing our beverages. Several municipalities in the United States
have implemented or are considering implementing taxes on the sale of certain &ldquo;sugared&rdquo; beverages
 including non-diet
soft drinks
 fruit drinks
 teas and flavored waters to help fund various initiatives. These taxes could materially affect our
business and financial results.


    
    


Additional
taxes levied on us could harm our financial results.

Recent
legislative proposals to reform U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings could have a material adverse effect on our financial results
by subjecting a significant portion of our non-U.S. earnings to incremental U.S. taxation and/or by delaying or permanently deferring
certain deductions otherwise allowed in calculating our U.S. tax liabilities.

We
compete in an industry that is brand-conscious
 so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success.

Our
business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers.
In addition
 our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brands as beverage brands that have the
potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors&rsquo; existing beverage sales. Although we believe
that we have been relatively successful towards establishing our brands as recognizable brands in the all-natural &ldquo;better
for you&rdquo; beverage industry
 it may be too early in the product life cycle of these brands to determine whether our products
and brands will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors
 retail customers and consumers.
We believe that the success of our brands will also be substantially dependent upon acceptance of our product name brands. Accordingly
any failure of our brands to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect
on our revenues and financial results.

Competition
from traditional non-alcoholic beverage manufacturers may adversely affect our distribution relationships and may hinder development
of our existing markets
 as well as prevent us from expanding our markets.

We
target a niche in the estimated $90 billion carbonated and non-carbonated soft drink markets in the US
 Canada and international
markets. Our brands are generally regarded as premium and natural
 with upscale packaging and are loosely defined as the artisanal
(craft)
 premium bottled carbonated soft drink category. The soft drink industry is highly fragmented
 and the craft soft drink
category consists of such competitors as IBC
 Stewart&rsquo;s
 Zevia
 Henry Weinhard&rsquo;s
 Hansen&rsquo;s
 Izze
 Boylan and
Jones Soda
 to name a few. These brands have the advantage of being seen widely in the national market and being commonly known
for years through well-funded ad campaigns. Our products have a relatively high price for an artisanal premium beverage product
minimal mass media advertising to date and a small but growing presence in the mainstream market compared to some of our larger
competitors.

The
beverage industry is highly competitive. We compete with other beverage companies not only for consumer acceptance but also for
shelf space in retail outlets and for marketing focus by our distributors
 all of which also distribute other beverage brands.
Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers
 most of which have substantially
greater financial
 marketing and distribution resources than ours. Some of these competitors are placing pressure on independent
distributors not to carry competitive sparkling brands such as ours. We also compete with regional beverage producers and &ldquo;private
label&rdquo; soft drink suppliers.

Increased
competitor consolidations
 market-place competition
 particularly among branded beverage products
 and competitive product and
pricing pressures could impact our earnings
 market share and volume growth. If
 due to such pressure or other competitive threats
we are unable to sufficiently maintain or develop our distribution channels
 we may be unable to achieve our current revenue and
financial targets. As a means of maintaining and expanding our distribution network
 we intend to introduce new
 innovative products
and packages. We may not be successful in doing this and other companies may be more successful in this regard over the long term.
Competition
 particularly from companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours
 could have a material adverse
effect on our existing markets
 as well as on our ability to expand the market for our products.

We
compete in an industry characterized by rapid changes in consumer preferences and public perception
 so our ability to continue
developing new products to satisfy our consumers&rsquo; changing preferences will determine our long-term success.

Failure
to introduce new products or product extensions into the marketplace as current ones mature and to meet our consumers&rsquo; changing
preferences could prevent us from gaining market share and achieving long-term profitability. Product lifecycles can vary
 and
consumers&rsquo; preferences and loyalties change over time. Although we try to anticipate these shifts and innovate new products
to introduce to our consumers
 we may not succeed. Customer preferences also are affected by factors other than taste
 such as
health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns
 shifting consumer needs
 changes in consumer lifestyles
 increased consumer
information and competitive product and pricing pressures. Sales of our products may be adversely affected by the negative publicity
associated with these issues. If we do not adequately anticipate or adjust to respond to these and other changes in customer preferences
we may not be able to maintain and grow our brand image and our sales may be adversely affected.


    
    


Global
economic conditions may continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations.

The
beverage industry
 and particularly those companies selling premium beverages
 can be affected by macro-economic factors
 including
changes in national
 regional
 and local economic conditions
 unemployment levels and consumer spending patterns
 which together
may impact the willingness of consumers to purchase our products as they adjust their discretionary spending. Adverse economic
conditions may negatively impact the ability of our distributors to obtain the credit necessary to fund their working capital
needs
 which could negatively impact their ability or desire to continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies
and volumes as they have done in the past. If we experience adverse economic conditions in the future
 sales of our products could
be adversely affected
 collectability of accounts receivable may be compromised
 and we may face obsolescence issues with our
inventory
 any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

If
we encounter product recalls or other product quality issues
 our business may suffer.

Product
quality issues
 real or imagined
 or allegations of product contamination
 even when false or unfounded
 could tarnish our image
and could cause consumers to choose other products. In addition
 because of changing government regulations or implementation
thereof
 or allegations of product contamination
 we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific
markets. Product recalls could affect our profitability and could negatively affect brand image.

We
could be exposed to product liability claims.

Although
we have product liability and basic recall insurance
 insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all product liability
claims that may arise. To the extent our product liability coverage is insufficient
 a product liability claim would likely have
a material adverse effect upon our financial condition. In addition
 any product liability claim brought against us may materially
damage the reputation and brand image of our products and business.

Our
business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly.

The
production
 marketing and sale of our beverages
 including contents
 labels
 caps and containers
 are subject to the rules and
regulations of various federal
 provincial
 state and local health agencies. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or
future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations
 we may be fined
 or production may be stopped
which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly
 any adverse publicity associated with
any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore
 the rules and regulations
are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area
 we cannot anticipate whether changes
in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements
 whether labeling
environmental
 tax or otherwise
 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Significant
additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products.

Various
jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the chemical content
or perceived adverse health consequences of certain of our products. These types of requirements
 if they become applicable to
one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations
 may inhibit sales of such products.
In California
 a law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having
been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a
warning is not required. If a component found in one of our products is added to the list
 or if the increasing sensitivity of
detection methodology that may become available under this law and related regulations as they currently exist
 or as they may
be amended
 results in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in one of our beverages produced for sale
in California
 the resulting warning requirements or adverse publicity could affect our sales.


    
    


We
may not be able to develop successful new beverage products
 which are important to our growth.

An
important part of our strategy is to increase our sales through the development of new beverage products. We cannot provide assurance
that we will be able to continue to develop
 market and distribute future beverage products that will enjoy market acceptance.
The failure to continue to develop new beverage products that gain market acceptance could have an adverse impact on our growth
and materially adversely affect our financial condition. We may have higher obsolescent product expense if new products fail to
perform as expected due to the need to write off excess inventory of the new products.

Our
results of operations may be impacted in various ways by the introduction of new products
 even if they are successful
 including
the following:



    
    
sales
    of new products could adversely impact sales of existing products;

    
    
    

    
    
we
    may incur higher cost of goods sold and selling
 general and administrative expenses in the periods when we introduce new
    products due to increased costs associated with the introduction and marketing of new products
 most of which are expensed
    as incurred; and

    
    
    

    
    
when
    we introduce new platforms and package sizes
 we may experience increased freight and logistics costs as our co-packers adjust
    their facilities for the new products.


The
growth of our revenues is dependent on acceptance of our products by mainstream consumers.

We
have dedicated significant resources to introduce our products to the mainstream consumer. As such
 we have increased our sales
force and executed agreements with distributors who
 in turn
 distribute to mainstream consumers at grocery stores and other retailers.
If our products are not accepted by the mainstream consumer
 our business could suffer.

Our
failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.

We
may not correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise
 particularly
with new products
 and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth
 particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate
demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including
 but not limited to
 glass
cans
 cartons
 labels
 flavors or packing arrangements
 we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Furthermore
industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates and sweeteners have been and could
 from time to time in the future
 be
experienced
 which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect
on our business and financial results. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk.

The
loss of our largest customers would substantially reduce revenues.

Our
customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers
 our business
could suffer.

During
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company had two broker/distributors that accounted for approximately 12% and
11% of its sales
 respectively; and during the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company had two broker/distributors
that accounted for 24% and 17% of its sales
 respectively. These two broker/distributors serve hundreds if not thousands
of various retail chains and end customers.

No
other customer exceeded 10% of sales for either period.


    
    


The
loss of our largest vendors would substantially reduce revenues.

Our
vendors are important to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing vendors
 our business
could suffer.

During
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company&rsquo;s largest three vendors accounted for approximately 12%
11%
 and 10% of its purchases
 respectively. During the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company&rsquo;s
largest two vendors accounted for 16% and 13% of its purchases
 respectively.

As
of December 31
 2019
 the Company&rsquo;s largest three vendors accounted for 19%
 15% and 14% of the total accounts payable
respectively. As of December 31
 2018
 one vendor accounted for 24% of total accounts payable.

No
other account was more than 10% of the balance of accounts payable in either period. 

The
loss of our third-party distributors could impair our operations and substantially reduce our financial results.

We
depend in large part on distributors to distribute our beverages and other products. Some of our outside distributors are not
bound by written agreements with the Company and may discontinue their relationship with us on short notice. Some distributors
handle a number of competitive products. In addition
 our products are a small part of our distributors&rsquo; businesses.

We
continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into distribution arrangements with regional bottlers or other
direct store delivery distributors having established sales
 marketing and distribution organizations. Many of our distributors
are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. In many
cases
 such products compete directly with our products.

The
marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing
distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional distributors
 and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products
above the products of our competitors
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Price
fluctuations in
 and unavailability of
 raw materials and packaging that we use could adversely affect us.

We
do not enter into hedging arrangements for raw materials. Although the prices of raw materials that we use have not increased
significantly in recent years
 our results of operations would be adversely affected if the price of these raw materials were
to rise and we were unable to pass these costs on to our customers.

We
depend upon an uninterrupted supply of the ingredients for our products
 a significant portion of which we obtain overseas
 principally
from Peru
 Fiji and Indonesia. We do not have agreements guaranteeing supply of our ingredients. Any decrease in the supply of
these ingredients or increase in the prices of these ingredients as a result of any adverse weather conditions
 pests
 crop disease
interruptions of shipment or political considerations
 among other reasons
 could substantially increase our costs and adversely
affect our financial performance.

We
also depend upon an uninterrupted supply of packaging materials
 such as glass
 cans and paper items. We obtain bottles both domestically
and internationally. Any decrease in supply of these materials or increase in the prices of the materials
 as a result of decreased
supply or increased demand
 could substantially increase our costs and adversely affect our financial performance.

The
loss of any of our co-packers could impair our operations and substantially reduce our financial results.

We
rely on third parties
 called co-packers in our industry
 to produce our beverages.

During
the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had utilized four and three
 respectively
 separate
US based co-packers for most its production needs. Although there are other packers that could produce the Company&rsquo;s beverages
a change in packers may cause a delay in the production process
 which could ultimately affect operating results.


    
    


Our
co-packing arrangements with other companies are on a short-term basis and such co-packers may discontinue their relationship
with us on short notice. Our co-packing arrangements expose us to various risks
 including:



    
    
if
    any of those co-packers were to terminate our co-packing arrangement or have difficulties in producing beverages for us
 our
    ability to produce our beverages would be adversely affected until we were able to make alternative arrangements; and

    
    
    

    
    
our
    business reputation would be adversely affected if any of the co-packers were to produce inferior quality.


We
believe that we have substantially reduced this risk by reducing our reliance upon any single co-packer. We are in discussion
and negotiation with additional co-packers to ensure added capability for future production needs.

We
compete in an industry characterized by rapid changes in consumer preferences and public perception
 so our ability to continue
to market our existing products and develop new products to satisfy our consumers&rsquo; changing preferences will determine our
long-term success.

Consumers
are seeking greater variety in their beverages. Our future success will depend
 in part
 upon our continued ability to develop
and introduce different and innovative beverages. In order to retain and expand our market share
 we must continue to develop
and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality and health
 although there can be
no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future.
Additionally
 many of our products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods
 we
may have to reduce profit margins
 which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition
 there is increasing awareness
and concern for the health consequences of obesity. This may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages
 which could affect our
profitability. Product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before
consumers&rsquo; preferences change. The beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their lifecycles and there can
be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer
preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. We may be unable to achieve
volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. We also may be unable to penetrate new markets. If our revenues decline
our business
 financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.

Our
quarterly operating results may fluctuate because of the seasonality of our business.

Our
highest revenues occur during the summer and fall
 the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. These seasonality issues
may cause our financial performance to fluctuate. In addition
 beverage sales can be adversely affected by sustained periods of
bad weather.

Our
manufacturing process is not patented.

None
of the manufacturing processes used in producing our products are subject to a patent or similar intellectual property protection.
Our only protection against a third party using our recipes and processes is confidentiality agreements with the companies that
produce our beverages and with our employees who have knowledge of such processes. If our competitors develop substantially equivalent
proprietary information or otherwise obtain access to our knowledge
 we will have greater difficulty in competing with them for
business
 and our market share could decline.

If
we are not able to retain the full-time services of our management team
 it will be more difficult for us to manage our operations
and our operating performance could suffer.

Our
business is dependent
 to a large extent
 upon the services of our management team. We do have a written employment agreement
with two of five members of our management team. In addition
 we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our management
team. Therefore
 in the event of the loss or unavailability of any member of the management team to us
 there can be no assurance
that we would be able to locate in a timely manner or employ qualified personnel to replace him or her. The loss of the services
of any member of our management team or our failure to attract and retain other key personnel over time would jeopardize our ability
to execute our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business
 results of operations and financial condition.


    
    


The
price of our common stock may be volatile
 and a shareholder&rsquo;s investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in
value.

There
has been significant volatility in the volume and market price of our common stock
 and this volatility may continue in the future.
In addition
 factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results
 litigation involving us
 general trends relating to
the beverage industry
 actions by governmental agencies
 national economic and stock market considerations as well as other events
and circumstances beyond our control could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock and the relative
volatility of such market price.

A
prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction
in our ability to raise capital. If we are unable to raise the funds required for all of our planned operations and key initiatives
we may be forced to allocate funds from other planned uses
 which may negatively impact our business and operations
 including
our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations.

Many
factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price of our shares. These factors include:



    
    
price
    and volume fluctuations in the stock markets;

    
    
    

    
    
changes
    in our revenues and earnings or other variations in operating results;

    
    
    

    
    
any
    shortfall in revenue or increase in losses from levels expected by us or securities analysts;

    
    
    

    
    
changes
    in regulatory policies or law;

    
    
    

    
    
operating
    performance of companies comparable to us; and

    
    
    

    
    
general
    economic trends and other external factors.


Even
if an active market for our common stock is established
 stockholders may have to sell their shares at prices substantially lower
than the price they paid for them or might otherwise receive than if a broad public market existed.

There
has been a very limited public trading market for our securities and the market for our securities may continue to be limited
and be sporadic and highly volatile.

There
is currently a limited public market for our common stock. Holders of our common stock may
 therefore
 have difficulty selling
their shares
 should they decide to do so. In addition
 there can be no assurances that such markets will continue or that any
shares which may be purchased
 may be sold without incurring a loss. Any such market price of our shares may not necessarily bear
any relationship to our book value
 assets
 past operating results
 financial condition or any other established criteria of value
and may not be indicative of the market price for the shares in the future.

Future
financings could adversely affect common stock ownership interest and rights in comparison with those of other security holders.

Our
board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock up to the amounts authorized in our certificate
of incorporation without stockholder approval
 subject to restrictive covenants contained in the Company&rsquo;s contracts. If
additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities
 the percentage ownership of our existing
stockholders will be reduced
 and these newly issued securities may have rights
 preferences or privileges senior to those of
existing stockholders. If we issue any additional common stock or securities convertible into common stock
 such issuance will
reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of each other stockholder. In addition
 such stock issuances might result
in a reduction of the book value of our common stock. Any increase of the number of authorized shares of common stock or preferred
stock would require board and shareholder approval and subsequent amendment to our certificate of incorporation.


    
    


Alcohol
Risk Factors

Demand
for our products may be adversely affected by many factors
 including changes in consumer preferences and trends.

Consumer
preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic and social trends
 public health initiatives
product innovations
 changes in vacation or leisure activity patterns and a downturn in economic conditions
 which may reduce
consumers&rsquo; willingness to purchase distilled spirits or cause a shift in consumer preferences away from ginger beer based
cocktails toward beer
 wine or non-alcoholic beverages. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet
consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations. The competitive
position of our brands could also be affected adversely by any failure to achieve consistent
 reliable quality in the product
or in service levels to customers.

We
face substantial competition in our industry and many factors may prevent us from competing successfully.

We
compete based on product taste and quality
 brand image
 price
 service and ability to innovate in response to consumer preferences.
The global spirits industry is highly competitive and is dominated by several large
 well-funded international companies. It is
possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or effectively or resort
to price competition to sustain market share
 which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.

Adverse
public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products.

Anti-alcohol
groups have
 in the past
 advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements
 higher taxes and other regulations
designed to discourage alcohol consumption. More restrictive regulations
 negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or
changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption
of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could
 in turn
 significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue
growth
 causing a decline in our results of operations.

Class
action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adversely affect our business.

Companies
in the beverage alcohol industry are
 from time to time
 exposed to class action or other litigation relating to alcohol advertising
product liability
 alcohol abuse problems or health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. It is also possible that governments
could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government funded health care costs. Litigation or assertions
of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry
 and it is possible that we
 as well as our suppliers
could be named in litigation of this type.


    
    


Also
lawsuits have been brought in a number of states alleging that beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted
underage consumers in their advertising. Plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants&rsquo; advertisements
 marketing
and promotions violate the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in each of these states and seek repayment
of the family funds expended by the underage consumers. While we have not been named in these lawsuits
 we could be named in similar
lawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend
against
 depleting our cash and diverting our personnel resources and
 if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail
 our
business could be harmed significantly.

Regulatory
decisions and legal
 regulatory and tax changes could limit our business activities
 increase our operating costs and reduce our
margins.

Our
business is subject to extensive regulation in all of the countries in which we operate. This may include regulations regarding
production
 distribution
 marketing
 advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products. We are required to comply with these
regulations and to maintain various permits and licenses. We are also required to conduct business only with holders of licenses
to import
 warehouse
 transport
 distribute and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other governmental
regulations applicable to our industry will not change or become more stringent. Moreover
 because these laws and regulations
are subject to interpretation
 we may not be able to predict when and to what extent liability may arise. Additionally
 due to
increasing public concern over alcohol-related societal problems
 including driving while intoxicated
 underage drinking
 alcoholism
and health consequences from the abuse of alcohol
 various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions or
limits on advertising or other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current
or future regulations and requirements relating to our industry and products could result in monetary penalties
 suspension or
even revocation of our licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm
our business
 as we could find it necessary to raise our prices to maintain profit margins
 which could lower the demand for our
products and reduce our sales and profit potential.

Also
the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation both in the U.S. and internationally (and
 in the
U.S.
 at both the federal and state government levels)
 and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import
and excise duties in most countries around the world. An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly
harm our sales revenue and margins
 both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to
lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol.

CBD/Hemp
Extract Risk Factors

Our
CBD initiative may not materialize or develop as planned due to business and regulatory factors.

Our
CBD initiative may not materialize or develop as planned due a myriad of business and regulatory factors. For example
many companies are entering the CBD space and competition for market share and acceptance of new products will be significant.

Negative
press from having a hemp or cannabis-related line of business could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial
condition
 and results of operations.

There
is a misconception that hemp and marijuana
 which both belong to the cannabis family
 are the same thing
 but industrial hemp
is roughly defined as a cannabis plant with not more than 0.3 percent THC content on a dry-weight basis. Any hemp oil or hemp
derivative we use will comport with this definition of less than 0.3% THC. Despite this
 we may still receive negative attention
from regulatory bodies
 the press
 business clients
 or partners
 grounded in these broad misconceptions
 and this in turn can
materially adversely affect our business.


    
    


Possible
yet unanticipated changes in federal law could cause our products which include cannabis/industrial hemp CBD extracts to be illegal
or could otherwise prohibit
 limit or restrict our business and products
 forcing us to abandon our business activities or reduce
our financial prospects.

The
move toward ending hemp prohibition and the reemergence of a hemp economy began with the 2014 Farm Bill
 which provided states
with opportunities to create pilot programs for hemp research. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (&ldquo;2018 Bill&rdquo;)
was signed into law at the end of December 2018 and expands on the 2014 Farm Bill. The 2018 Bill removes &ldquo;hemp&rdquo; from
the definition of &ldquo;Marihuana&rdquo; in the Controlled Substances Act
 decriminalizes the plant and its components
 and as
a result
 transfers oversight of the cultivation and sale of the crop from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department
of Agriculture. The net result of the 2018 Bill&rsquo;s passage is that farmers and entrepreneurs gain several significant benefits
in addition to ending the uncertainty of criminal exposure for growing
 processing or selling hemp:



    
    
Federal
    licensing for farmers wishing to grow hemp in states that don&rsquo;t have a pilot program

    
    
    

    
    
Clarification
    that interstate commerce in hemp is permitted

    
    
    

    
    
Placing
    oversight of hemp with the USDA

    
    
    

    
    
Including
    hemp in the Federal Crop Insurance Act.


These
provisions will go a long way toward helping the industry by clarifying existing gray areas of law
 creating certainty around
transport and interstate sale
 and normalizing hemp as an industrial crop. However
 there can be no assurance that Federal laws
ending hemp prohibition will not be modified or repealed. In the event of either repeal of Federal regulations
 or of amendments
thereto which are adverse to our business and products
 we may be required to cease operations or restrict or limit our products
or the distribution thereof
 which could be expected to have adverse consequences to our business
 operations
 revenues and profitability.

Sources
of our key ingredient
 CBD extracts from cannabis/industrial hemp plants
 depend upon legality of cultivation
 processing
 marketing
and sales of products derived from those plants.

Our
key ingredient is broad spectrum CBD extracts derived from cannabis/industrial hemp plants. CBD may be legally produced in states
which have laws and regulations that qualify under 7 US Code &sect;5940 for implementation of &ldquo;agricultural pilot programs
to study the growth
 cultivation or marketing of industrial hemp&rdquo;
 apart from state laws legalizing and regulating medical
and recreational cannabis or marijuana which remains illegal under federal law. In addition
 Federal licensing for farmers wishing
to grow hemp in states that don&rsquo;t have a pilot program is now available as a result of the 2018 Bill. If we were to be unsuccessful
in arranging new sources of supply of our raw ingredients
 or if our raw ingredients were to become legally unavailable
 our business
and operations could be limited
 restricted or entirely prohibited
 which could be expected to have adverse consequences to our
business
 operations
 revenues and profitability.

We
may have difficulty accessing the service of banks which may make it difficult for us to operate.

Many
banks have not historically accepted deposits from and credit card processors will not clear transactions for businesses involved
with the broadly defined cannabis industry
 notwithstanding the legality of cannabis/industrial hemp derived products. While the
2018 Bill is expected to alleviate this hindrance
 we may still have difficulty finding a bank and credit card processor willing
to accept our business. The inability to open or maintain bank accounts or accept credit card payments from customers could be
expected to cause us difficulty processing transactions in the ordinary course of business
 including paying suppliers
 employees
and landlords
 which could have a significant negative effect on our operations and your investment in our common stock.


    
    


Risk
Factors Related to Our Common Stock

If
we are not able to achieve our objectives for our business
 the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected.

In
order to be successful
 we believe that we must
 among other things:



    
    
increase
    the volume for our products

    
    
    

    
    
continue
    to find savings in our cost of goods (co-packer fees
 packaging and ingredients);

    
    
    

    
    
expand
    the number of co-packers for our core and innovation products;

    
    
    

    
    
continue
    to recruit and retain top talent;

    
    
    

    
    
drive
    increased awareness through our brand pull campaigns
 and trial and repeat purchase of our core brands;

    
    
    

    
    
drive
    increased SKU placement on shelf
 and open new outlets of retail distribution through our investment in sales resources
 partnerships
    and trade marketing support;

    
    
    

    
    
manage
    our operating expenses to sufficiently support operating activities and

    
    
    

    
    
avoid
    significant increases in variable costs relating to production
 marketing and distribution.


We
may not be able to meet these objectives
 which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have incurred
significant operating expenses in the past and may do so again in the future and
 as a result
 will need to increase revenues
in order to improve our results of operations. Our ability to increase sales volume will depend primarily on success in marketing
initiatives with industry brokers
 improving our distribution base with DSD companies
 introducing new no sugar brands
 and focusing
on the existing core brands in the market. Our ability to successfully enter new distribution areas and obtain national accounts
will
 in turn
 depend on various factors
 many of which are beyond our control
 including
 but not limited to
 the continued demand
for our brands and products in target markets
 the ability to price our products at competitive levels
 the ability to establish
and maintain relationships with distributors in each geographic area of distribution and the ability in the future to create
develop and successfully introduce one or more new brands
 products
 and product extensions.

Anti-takeover
provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult
 limit attempts by our
stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.

Provisions
in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in
our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:



    
    
authorize
    our board of directors to issue
 without further action by the stockholders
 shares of undesignated preferred stock;

    
    
    

    
    
specify
    that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only upon the request of a majority of our board of directors or our
    Chief Executive Officer;

    
    
    

    
    
establish
    an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting
 including proposed nominations
    of persons for election to our board of directors; and

    
    
    

    
    
prohibit
    cumulative voting in the election of directors.


These
provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it
more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors
 which is responsible for appointing the members
of our management
 and may discourage
 delay or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of our Company that is in
the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt
 the existence of these provisions may
adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.


    
    


Furthermore
we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general
 Section 203 prohibits a publicly
held Delaware corporation from engaging in a &ldquo;business combination&rdquo; with an &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo; for
a three-year period following the time that this stockholder becomes an interested stockholder
 unless the business combination
is approved in a prescribed manner. A &ldquo;business combination&rdquo; includes
 among other things
 a merger
 asset or stock
sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo;
is a person who
 together with affiliates and associates
 owns
 or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested
stockholder status
 15% or more of the corporation&rsquo;s voting stock. Under Section 203
 a business combination between a corporation
and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions:



    
    
before
    the stockholder became interested
 the board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which
    resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

    
    
    

    
    
upon
    consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder
 the interested stockholder
    owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced
 excluding for
    purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding
 shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers
 and employee
    stock plans
 in some instances; or

    
    
    

    
    
at
    or after the time the stockholder became interested
 the business combination was approved by the board of directors of the
    corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds
    of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.


The
existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
does not approve in advance. Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for
the shares of Common Stock held by stockholders.

These
provisions of Delaware law and the Certificate of Incorporation could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile
takeovers and
 as a consequence
 they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of the Company&rsquo;s common
stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing
changes in the Company&rsquo;s management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions
that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.

Raptor/
Harbor Reeds SPV LLC (&ldquo;Raptor)
 our largest shareholder
 holds approximately 5% of our outstanding common stock and
beneficially owns approximately 15% of our common stock and may greatly influence the outcome of all matters on which stockholders
vote.

Because
Raptor holds approximately 5% of our outstanding common stock and beneficially owns approximately 15% of our common
stock
 it may greatly influence the outcome of all matters on which stockholders vote. Daniel J. Doherty III
 a principal and
shareholder of Raptor also serves as a director of Reed&rsquo;s. Raptor is a secured creditor of Reed&rsquo;s and its interests
may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. (Beneficial ownership is calculated pursuant
to Section 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 and includes shares underlying derivative securities which
may be exercised or converted within 60 days.)

Collectively
members of our board of directors and our executive officers hold approximately 17% of the Company&rsquo;s outstanding
common stock
 beneficially own approximately 26% of our common stock and may greatly influence the outcome of all matters
on which stockholders vote.

Collectively
members of our board of directors and our executive officers hold approximately 17% of our outstanding common stock and
beneficially own approximately 26% of our common stock. Of these percentages
 Daniel J. Doherty III
 a director of Reed&rsquo;s
as principal and shareholder of Raptor beneficially owns approximately 15% of our common stock. Members of our board of
directors and our executive officers may influence the outcome of certain matters on which stockholders vote. (Beneficial ownership
is calculated pursuant to Section 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 and includes shares underlying derivative
securities which may be exercised or converted within 60 days.)


    
    


Raptor&rsquo;s
interests may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock.

Raptor
is a secured creditor of Reed&rsquo;s
 holding a subordinated note with a principal balance of $3
400
000 and additional reserved
principal amount of $4
000
000 to cover the permitted over-advance under Rosenthal&rsquo;s $13
000
0000 credit facility. Raptor&rsquo;s
security interest is subordinate to Rosenthal&rsquo;s first priority security interest. The $4
000
000 permitted over-advance
is guaranteed by Daniel J. Doherty III and Daniel J. Doherty III 2002 Family Trust through the issuance of an irrevocable stand-by-letter
of credit in favor of Rosenthal
 in amount not less than $1
500
000. The permitted over-advance is secured by all of Reed&rsquo;s
intellectual property collateral. In the event of default under Reed&rsquo;s financing agreement with Rosenthal
 Raptor has a
put option to purchase the entire aggregate amount of the outstanding permitted over-advance of up to $4
000
000 at par plus accrued
interest (without regard to any prepayment penalty or premium) from Rosenthal
 prior to Rosenthal declaring a default under the
financing agreement. If Raptor exercises the option
 Rosenthal will release its first priority security interest on all intellectual
property collateral of the Company to Raptor and terminate the letter of credit. As such
 Raptor&rsquo;s interests may not always
coincide with the interests of other holders of Reed&rsquo;s common stock.

If
securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our shares
 publish negative research or reports
 or do not publish reports
about our business
 our share price and trading volume could decline.

The
trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish
about us
 our business and our industry. If one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares or
our competitors&rsquo; stock
 our share price would likely decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly
publish reports on us
 we could lose visibility in the financial markets
 which in turn could cause our share price or trading
volume to decline. As a result
 the market price for our common stock may decline.

We
have the ability to issue additional shares of our common stock and shares of preferred stock without asking for stockholder approval
which could cause your investment to be diluted.

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorize the Board of Directors to issue up to 100
000
000 shares of common stock and up to
500
000 shares of preferred stock. The power of the Board of Directors to issue shares of common stock
 preferred stock or warrants
or options to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock is generally not subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly
any additional issuance of our common stock
 or preferred stock that may be convertible into common stock
 may have the effect
of diluting your investment
 and the new securities may have rights
 preferences and privileges senior to those of our common
stock.

Substantial
sales of our stock may impact the market price of our common stock.

Future
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock
 including shares that we may issue upon exercise of options and warrants
 could
adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further
 if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock
or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock
 the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced
and the price of our common stock may fall.

Our
common stock is thinly traded
 and investors may be unable to sell some or all of their shares at the price they would like
 or
at all
 and sales of large blocks of shares may depress the price of our common stock.

Our
common stock has historically been sporadically or &ldquo;thinly-traded
&rdquo; meaning that the number of persons interested
in purchasing shares of our common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent. As a consequence
there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in shares of our common stock is minimal or non-existent
 as
compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales
without an adverse effect on share price. This could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Investors may be unable to
sell their common stock at or above their purchase price
 which may result in substantial losses. Also
 as a consequence of this
lack of liquidity
 the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the
price of shares of our common stock in either direction. The price of shares of our common stock could
 for example
 decline precipitously
in the event a large number of shares of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand
 as compared to
a seasoned issuer that could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price.


    
    


We
do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future
 so our shareholders will not be able
to receive a return on their shares unless they sell their shares.

We
intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any
cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid
 and if
dividends are paid
 there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends
 our shareholders
will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell such shares.

Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans

2007
Stock Option Plan
 2015 Incentive and Non-statutory and Stock Option Plan
 and the Second Amended and Restated 2017 Incentive
Compensation plan

On
October 8
 2007
 our board of directors adopted the 2007 Stock Option Plan for 1
500
000 shares and the plan was approved by our
stockholders on November 19
 2007. On December 30
 2015
 the 2015 Incentive and Non-statutory Stock Option Plan for 500
000 shares
was approved by our shareholders. Options issued and subsequently forfeited under the 2015 plan cannot be reissued. In 2017 the
2007 plan expired
 and no new options will be granted under the plan. On September 29
 2017
 the 2017 Compensation Plan for 3
000
000
shares was approved by our shareholders. On December 13
 2018 the Amended and Restated 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan was
approved by our shareholders increasing the number of shares issuable by 3
500
000 to 6
500
000. On December 16
2019
 the Second Amended and Restated 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan was approved by our shareholders
 increasing the number
of shares issuable by 1
000
000 to 7
500
000. Options issued and forfeited under the Second Amended and Restated 2017
Incentive Compensation Plan contain an evergreen provision and cannot be re-priced without shareholder approval.




    
    


The
plans permit the grant of options and stock awards to our employees
 directors and consultants. The options may constitute either
&ldquo;incentive stock options&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or &ldquo;non-qualified stock
options&rdquo;. The primary difference between &ldquo;incentive stock options&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-qualified stock options&rdquo;
is that once an option is exercised
 the stock received under an &ldquo;incentive stock option&rdquo; has the potential of being
taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains rate
 while stock received by exercising a &ldquo;non-qualified stock option&rdquo;
is taxed according to the ordinary income tax rate schedule.

The
plans are currently administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors. The plan administrator has full
and final authority to select the individuals to receive options and to grant such options as well as a wide degree of flexibility
in determining the terms and conditions of options
 including vesting provisions.

The
exercise price of an option granted under the plan cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of common stock
on the date of the grant of the option. The exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a person owning more than 10%
of the total combined voting power of the common stock must be at least 110% of the fair market value per share of common stock
on the date of the grant. Options may not be granted under the plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the plan.
Incentive stock options granted to a person owning more than 10% of the combined voting power of the common stock cannot be exercisable
for more than five years.

When
an option is exercised
 the purchase price of the underlying stock will be paid in cash
 except that the plan administrator may
permit the exercise price to be paid in any combination of cash
 shares of stock having a fair market value equal to the exercise
price
 or as otherwise determined by the plan administrator.

If
an optionee ceases to be an employee
 director
 or consultant with us
 other than by reason of death
 disability or retirement
all vested options must be exercised within three months following such event. However
 if an optionee&rsquo;s employment or consulting
relationship with us terminates for cause
 or if a director of ours is removed for cause
 all unexercised options will terminate
immediately. If an optionee ceases to be an employee or director of
 or a consultant to us
 by reason of death
 disability
 or
retirement
 all vested options may be exercised within one year following such event or such shorter period as is otherwise provided
in the related agreement.

For
the 2015 plan
 when a stock option expires or is terminated before it is exercised
 the shares are canceled and cannot be reissued.
For the Second Amended and Restated 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan
 when a stock option expires or is terminated
before it is exercised
 the shares are not replenished. The option strike price cannot be re-priced without shareholder approval.

No
option can be granted under any plan after ten years following the earlier of the date the plan was adopted by the board of directors
or the date the plan was approved by our stockholders.

 with a significantly enhanced sales and marketing infrastructure
capable of driving accelerated growth. The Company is better positioned to focus on driving growth and building
its brands
 with capital flexibility
 a reduced need for capital expenditures
 and an improved operating model.

(A)
Gross sales are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance
 including sales performance
of particular products
 salesperson performance
 product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross
sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items
 which can mask certain performance issues.
We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales
are not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales
 which is determined
in accordance with GAAP
 and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally
gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies
 as gross sales have been defined by our
internal reporting practices. In addition
 gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments
and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.


    
    


(B)
Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements
 the disclosure
thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally
 our definition of promotional and other allowances may
not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration
given to the Company&rsquo;s distributors or retail customers including
 but not limited to the following: (i) reimbursements
given to the Company&rsquo;s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers
 including slotting
 shelf
space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (ii) the Company&rsquo;s agreed share of fees given to distributors
and/or directly to retailers for in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iii) the Company&rsquo;s agreed share of slotting
shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (iv) incentives given to the Company&rsquo;s distributors and/or
retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; and (v) discounted or free products. The presentation
of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending
levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing
activities. The Company&rsquo;s promotional allowance programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through
separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements
described above and are of varying durations
 ranging from one week to one year.

(C)
Cost of goods produced: Cost of goods produced consists of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture
of products
 co-packing fees
 repacking fees
 in-bound freight charges
 inventory adjustments
 as well as certain internal transfer
costs. Cost of goods produced is used internally by management to measure the direct costs of goods sold
 aside from unallocated
plant costs. Cost of goods produced is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative
to cost of goods sold
 which is determined in accordance with GAAP
 and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating
performance in place of cost of goods sold.

(D)
Cost of goods sold &ndash; idle capacity: Cost of goods sold &ndash; idle capacity consists of direct production costs in excess
of charges allocated to our finished goods in production. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the
period incurred rather than added to the cost of finished goods produced. Plant costs include labor costs
 production supplies
repairs and maintenance
 and inventory write-off. Our charges for labor and overhead allocated to our finished goods are determined
on a market cost basis
 which is lower than our actual costs incurred. Cost of goods sold &ndash; idle capacity is not a measure
that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cost of goods sold
 which is determined in accordance
with GAAP
 and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of cost of goods sold.

Sales
Cost of Sales
 and Gross Margin

The
following chart sets forth key statistics for the transition of the Company&rsquo;s top line activity from the year ending December
31
 2018 through the year ending December 31
 2019.

As
part of the Company&rsquo;s ongoing initiative to simplify and streamline operations by reducing the number of SKUs
 the Company
has identified core products to place its strategic focus on. These core products consist of Reed&rsquo;s and Virgil&rsquo;s branded
beverages. Non-core products consist primarily of slower selling discontinued Reed&rsquo;s and Virgil&rsquo;s SKUs
 discontinued
brands such as China Cola and Sonoma Sparklers
 as well private label SKUs which were sold to California Custom Beverage as part
of the plant sale on December 31
 2018.



As
a result of our decision to focus on the core Reed&rsquo;s and Virgil&rsquo;s beverage brands and simplify operations by reducing
the overall number of SKUs that we offer
 the Company&rsquo;s core beverage volume for the year ended December 31
 2019 represented
approximately 96% of gross revenue.

Core
brand gross revenue increased 9% during the year ended December 31
 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31
 2018
to $37
769 from $34
746
 driven by Virgil&rsquo;s volume growth of 23%. This increase was reduced by lapping
$3
757 of discontinued and private label sales which are no longer part of our portfolio. The result is a decrease of total gross
revenue of 6%
 to $39
300 from $41
974 during the prior year. Our gross sales were impacted as we short shipped approximately
$2
751 of orders to customers during the year ended December 31
 2019 due to product availability challenges related
to lower than expected co-packer production and innovation production delays.

On
a 12-ounce case basis
 price on our core brands remained flat year over year
 while core volume grew 9% vs the year-ago
period.

Discounts
as a percentage of gross sales increased to 14% in the year ended December 31
 2019 from 9% in the prior year. The increase in
our promotions was due to the activation of new promotions for our existing Reed&rsquo;s and Virgil&rsquo;s SKUs as well as the
incremental promotional and slotting spend related to product introduction of our innovation SKUs such as Reed&rsquo;s Zero sugar
bottles and cans and Reed&rsquo;s cans. As a result
 net sales revenue decreased 11% for the year ended December 31
 2019 to $33
820
compared to $38
102 for the year ended December 31
 2018.

Cost
of Goods Sold and Produced

Cost
of goods sold decreased $1
480 during the year ended December 31
 2019 as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of net sales
cost of goods sold increased 5 percentage points during the year ended December 31
 2019
 to 77% from 72% in the prior year. Idle
and other costs were reduced to $309
 down from $2
428 in the prior year. The plant sale has significantly reduced our
idle costs
 while the remaining other costs were related to completing the transition of the plant to California Custom Beverages.
We do not anticipate idle charges to be incurred going forward. The increase in cost of goods sold was driven by an increase in
inventory obsolescence reserves and write offs related to our rebranding efforts and formulation enhancements
 mostly offset by
the reduction in idle costs.

Idle
and other costs were reduced to $309
 down from $2
428 in the prior year. The plant sale has significantly reduced our
idle costs
 while the remaining other costs were related to completing the transition of the plant to California Custom Beverages.
We do not anticipate any more idle plant costs now that we have exited the Los Angeles facility.

Total
cost of goods per case increased from to $12.2 per case in the year ended December 31
 2019 from $11.8 per case
during the prior year driven by increased efficiencies having exited the Los Angeles facility. We are continuing to work with
suppliers and co-packers to improve our processes and maximize cost efficiencies as the company&rsquo;s new product offerings
continue to grow and scale.

Gross
Margin

The
impact of the increase in inventory obsolescence reserves and write offs resulted in a reduction in gross margin in the year ended
December 31
 2019
 to 23% compared to 28% in the prior year.


    
    


Operating
Expenses

Delivery
and Handling Expenses

Delivery
and handling expenses consist of delivery costs to customers and warehousing costs incurred for handling our finished goods after
production. Delivery and handling expenses increased by $504 in the year ended December 31
 2019 to $5
993 from $5
489 in the
prior year driven by increased volumes. The increase in the rate per case to $2.8 per case this year from $2.4 per case
in the prior year is driven by additional freight required to rebalance inventory at the needed warehouse locations
 shipping
innovation products produced in limited locations and higher than expected less than truck load shipments to support of the launch
of new retail accounts. As we work to expand our copacker footprint and capabilities later this year
 we anticipate transportation
costs to reduce.

Selling
and Marketing Expenses

Marketing
expenses consist of direct marketing
 marketing labor and marketing support costs. Selling expenses consist of all other selling-related
expenses including personnel and contractor support.

Total
selling and marketing expenses were $9
188 during the year ended December 31
 2019
 compared to $4
879 during the prior year.
As a percentage of net sales
 selling and marketing costs increased to 27% during the year ended December 31
 2019
 as compared
to 13% of net revenue during the prior year. The increased investment in sales and marketing is consistent with the Company&rsquo;s
strategy to refresh the brands
 launch new products into the market
 open new doors of distribution
 create new communication
campaigns to increase core brands sales velocity and lay the groundwork to re-accelerate growth of the core brands. The increase
is due to additional personnel and broker selling network
 integrated marketing campaign creative and production
 and innovation
development (product
 research
 and packaging).

General
and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of the cost of executive
 administrative
 and finance personnel
 as well as professional
fees. General and administrative expenses decreased in the year ended December 31
 2019 from $8
388 to $7
596
 a
decrease of $792 from the prior year. Our general and administrative expense decrease was largely driven by the exit of
the Los Angeles facility and reduction of office expenses
 leases
 and utilities.

Loss
from Operations

The
loss from operations was $14
856 for the year ended December 31
 2019
 as compared to a loss of $8
122 in the prior year driven
by increase investment in sales and marketing initiatives as well as delivery and handling expenses.

Interest
and Other Expense

Interest

Interest

the change in fair value of our warrant liability of $30. During the prior year
 interest expense was $2
201
 and expense related
to the change in fair value of our warrant liability was $2. The decrease in interest expense is the result of lower borrowings
as well as lower rates on our revolving line of credit.


    
    


Modified
EBITDA

In
addition to our GAAP results
 we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. However
 Modified EBITDA
is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income
 income from operations
or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP
 or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities
as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss)
 plus interest expense
 depreciation and amortization
stock-based compensation
 changes in fair value of warrant expense
 and one-time restructuring-related costs including employee
severance and asset impairment.

Management
considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management
of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period. Non-GAAP adjustments
to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons
we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA
 you should be aware that in the future
we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified
EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Set
forth below is a reconciliation of net loss to Modified EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

We
present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods
on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition
we use Modified EBITDA in developing our internal budgets
 forecasts and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our
business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions; making compensation decisions; and in communications with our board
of directors concerning our financial performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool
 which includes
 among
others
 the following:



    
    
Modified
    EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures
 or future requirements
 for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

    
    
    

    
    
Modified
    EBITDA does not reflect changes in
 or cash requirements for
 our working capital needs;

    
    
    

    
    
Modified
    EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense
 or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments
    on our debts; and

    
    
    

    
&#9679;
    
Although
    depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges
 the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced
    in the future
 and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.



    
    


Liquidity
and Capital Resources

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Such
assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company recorded a net loss of $16
112 and used cash in operations of $18
161. As
of December 31
 2019
 we had a cash balance of $913 with borrowing capacity of $3
235
 stockholders&rsquo; equity of $1
147
and a working capital of $4
885
 compared to a cash balance of $624 stockholders&rsquo; deficit of $6
743 and working
capital shortfall of $3
297 at December 31
 2018. Notwithstanding the loss for 2019
 management projects adequate cash from
operations and available line of credit in 2020 to ensure continuation of the Company as a going concern.

On
February 20
 2019
 the Company conducted a public offering of 7
733
750 shares of its common stock at $2.10 per share resulting
to net proceeds to the Company of $14
867. In October 2019
 the Company conducted a public offering of 13
416
667 shares of its
common stock at $0.60 per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $7
474.

Historically
we have financed our operations through public and private sales of common stock
 issuance of preferred and common stock
 convertible
debt instruments
 term loans and credit lines from financial institutions
 and cash generated from operations. We have taken decisive
action to improve our margins
 including fully outsourcing our manufacturing process
 streamlining our product portfolio
 negotiating
improved vendor contracts and restructuring our selling prices.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
or GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements including
various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories
 the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks
and trademark licenses
 as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the
normal course of business. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices:

Accounts
Receivable. 
where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer&rsquo;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific
reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes
will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded
based on the Company&rsquo;s historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.

Inventory.

quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product
demand and our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could
affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences
 general market conditions or other factors
which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers. Additionally
our management&rsquo;s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate
 which could result in an understated or overstated
provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.

Intangible
Assets and Impairment Policy. 
 so classified because
we anticipate that these brand names will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. Indefinite-lived intangible assets
are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life
is appropriate. As part of our impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than
not the asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our asset with its book value.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Management
believes the accounting estimates related to impairment of our long lived assets
 including our intangibles
 are &ldquo;critical
accounting estimates&rdquo; because: (1) they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires an estimate
of fair value
 which is based on assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact of an impairment on our balance
sheet and net income could be material. Management&rsquo;s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant
judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and we expect they will continue to do so. In estimating
future revenues
 we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data for existing product lines
and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows.


    
    


Revenue
Recognition
is reasonably assured
 which generally occurs when product is shipped. A written order from the customer must be received and
credit acceptance procedures performed prior to shipment of product. The Company does not have any significant contracts with
customers requiring performance beyond delivery
 and contracts with customers contain no incentives or discounts that could cause
revenue to be allocated or adjusted over time. Shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains control
of the goods and therefore represent a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service to the customer. Revenue and costs
of sales are recognized when control of the products transfers to our customer
 which generally occurs upon shipment from our
facilities. The Company&rsquo;s performance obligations are satisfied at that time. The Company does not allow for returns
 except
for damaged products when the damage occurred pre-fulfillment. Damaged product returns have historically been insignificant. Because
of this
 the stand-alone nature of our products
 and our assessment of performance obligations and transaction pricing for our
sales contracts
 we do not currently maintain a contract asset or liability balance for obligations. We assess our contracts and
the reasonableness of our conclusions on a quarterly basis.

Stock
Compensation Expense
in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for such grants issued and vesting
to employees based on ASC 718
 whereby the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation
expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement
date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. On January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) 2018-07 which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services
from nonemployees. The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation within its statements of operations with
classification depending on the nature of the services rendered. The adoption of the new standard had no cumulative effect on
previously reported amounts. Awards granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to
be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the awards vest
 they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment
is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting. In certain
circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee
 option grants are immediately vested
 and
the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.

The
fair value of the Company&rsquo;s stock option and restricted stock grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option
Pricing model
 which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock
options or restricted stock
 and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton
Option Pricing model and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could
materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

Warrant
Liabilities.
Some of these warrant agreements contain fundamental transaction provisions which may give rise to an obligation of the Company
to pay cash to the warrant holders. Those warrants with fundamental transaction terms are accounted for as liabilities given the
terms may give rise to an obligation of the Company to the warrant holders. These liabilities are measured at fair value at each
reporting period and the change in the fair value is recognized in earnings in the accompanying Statements of Operations. Fair
value is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest
rates
 expected volatility
 expected life
 and future dividends. Expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton
Option Pricing model and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could
materially affect the amount of expense recorded in future periods.

Management
believes the valuation of our warrant liabilities are &ldquo;critical accounting estimates&rdquo; because: (1) they require estimates
of risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life
 and future dividends; and (2) the impact of a change in these
estimates could be material to our balance sheet and net income. Management&rsquo;s assumptions about risk-free interest rates
expected volatility
 expected life
 and future dividends are based upon historical experience
 however future experience may fluctuate.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Reed&rsquo;s


Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31
 2019
and 2018
 the related statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the
years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2019
and 2018
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We
also have audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;)
the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019

Control &ndash; Integrated Framework
framework) and our report dated March 18
 2020 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud.


Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We
have served as the Company&rsquo;s auditor since 2004.

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For
the Years Ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
(In
thousands
 except share and per share amounts)

1.
Operations and Liquidity

Reed&rsquo;s
Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is the owner and maker of both Reed Craft Ginger Beer and Virgil&rsquo;s Handcrafted Sodas. Established
in 1989
 Reed&rsquo;s is America&rsquo;s best-selling Ginger Beer brand and has been the leader and innovator in the ginger beer
category for decades. Virgil&rsquo;s is America&rsquo;s best-selling independent
 full line of natural craft sodas. The Reed&rsquo;s
Inc. portfolio is sold in over 30
000 retail stores nationwide. Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Beers are unique due to the proprietary
process of using fresh ginger root combined with a Jamaican inspired recipe of natural spices and fruit juices. The Company uses
this same handcrafted approach in its award-winning Virgil&rsquo;s line of great tasting
 bold flavored craft sodas.



The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Such
assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the year
ended December 31
 2019
 the Company recorded a net loss of $16
112 and used cash in operations of $18
161. As of December 31
2019
 we had a cash balance of $913 with borrowing capacity of $3
235
 stockholders&rsquo; equity of $1
147 and a working capital
of $4
885. Notwithstanding the net loss for 2019
 management projects adequate cash from operations and available line of credit
in 2020 to ensure continuation of the Company as a going concern.

In
2017
 the Company performed a complete operational review and developed a detailed action plan to capture performance improvements
drive core brand growth
 and become a premier &ldquo;asset-light&rdquo; sales and marketing organization. In September 2018
 the
Company completed the relocation of its headquarters to Norwalk
 Connecticut. In December 2018
 the Company sold its Los Angeles
manufacturing plant to a related party (see Note 13)
 marking a fundamental shift in the nature of the Company&rsquo;s operations
and effectively eliminated our costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity. With the sale of our manufacturing plant
all of the Company&rsquo;s production is subcontracted to co-packers
 which assemble our products and charge us a fee
 generally
by the case
 for the products they produce.

In
October 2018
 the Company entered into a financing agreement
with Rosenthal &amp; Rosenthal
 Inc.
 which replaced an existing credit facility (see Note 6). The Company&rsquo;s
annual debt service requirements
 on an annualized basis
 were reduced by approximately $1
500 as a result of the refinancing.
The current credit facility is for a term of 2.5 years
 and provides for borrowings of up to $13
000. As of December 31
2019 and 2018
 the Company had $3
235 and $1
201
 respectively
 of unused borrowing capacity under the financing agreement.


    
    


On
February 20
 2019
 the Company conducted a public offering of 7
733
750 shares of its common stock at $2.10 per share resulting
in net proceeds to the Company of $14
867.

On
October 25
 2019
 the Company conducted a public offering of 13
416
667 shares of its common stock at $0.60 per share resulting
in net proceeds to the Company of $7
474.

Historically
we have financed our operations through public and private sales of common stock
 issuance of preferred and common stock
 convertible
debt instruments
 term loans and credit lines from financial institutions
 and cash generated from operations. We have taken decisive
action to improve our margins
 including fully outsourcing our manufacturing process
 streamlining our product portfolio
 negotiating
improved vendor contracts and restructuring our selling prices.

2.
Significant Accounting Policies

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts
 inventory
obsolescence
 depreciable lives of property and equipment
 analysis of impairments of recorded long-term tangible and intangible
assets
 realization of deferred tax assets
 accruals for potential liabilities and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments
issued for services and assumptions used in valuing warrant liabilities.

Accounts
Receivable

The
Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the
Company becomes aware of a specific customer&rsquo;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific reserve
for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes
will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded
based on the Company&rsquo;s historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.

The
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts is established through a provision reducing the carrying value of receivables.
At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts was $375 and $623
 respectively.



Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities
on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and
our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand
for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences
 general market conditions or other factors
 which may
result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers. Additionally
 our management&rsquo;s
estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate
 which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for
excess and obsolete inventory. At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the reserve for inventory obsolescence aggregated $646 and $197
respectively.


    
    


Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of property and
equipment or increase production capacity are capitalized
 and expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets
as follows:



Property
    and Equipment Type
    
Years
    of Depreciation 

    
    
5
    years

Computers
    and office
    
3-7
    


Prior
to the sale of its manufacturing plant on December 31
 2018 (see Note 13)
 the Company depreciated buildings over 39 years and
machinery over 5-12 years.

Management
assesses the carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment
 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2019
and 2018
 the Company determined there were no indicators of impairment of its property and equipment.

Intangible
Assets

Intangible
assets are comprised of indefinite-lived brand names acquired
 so classified because we anticipate that these brand names will
contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment
annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. As part of our impairment test
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the asset is impaired. If further testing
is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
its fair value
 as determined by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company determined there was no impairment of its indefinite-lived brand names.
During our December 31
 2018 impairment testing
 we determined that our Sonoma Sparkler trademark was unlikely to provide
future benefit to the Company
 because we do not currently offer Sonoma Sparkler products and we do not anticipate doing so in
the foreseeable future. Accordingly
 we reduced the book value of this asset to zero as of December 31
 2018
 by recording an
impairment charge of $229.



The
Company&rsquo;s cash balances on deposit with banks are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
up to $250. Generally
 the Company&rsquo;s policy is to minimize borrowing costs by immediately applying cash receipts to borrowings
against its credit facility. From time to time
 however
 the Company may be exposed to risk for the amounts of funds held in bank
accounts in excess of the FDIC limit. To minimize the risk
 the Company&rsquo;s policy is to maintain cash balances with
high quality financial institutions.

Gross
sales.
 2019
 the Company&rsquo;s largest two customers accounted for 12% and 11% of gross
sales
 respectively. During the year ended December 31
 2018
 the largest two customers accounted for 24% and 17% of gross sales
respectively.

Accounts
receivable.
 2019
 the Company had accounts receivable from one customer which comprised 14% of its gross
accounts receivable. As of December 31
 2018
 accounts receivable from two customers comprised 36% and 19% of total accounts receivable
respectively.


    
    


During
the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 the Company utilized four and three
 respectively
 separate
co-packers for most its production and bottling of beverage products in the eastern United States. With the December 31
 2018
sale of its manufacturing plant
 the Company no longer conducts a manufacturing operation
 accordingly it utilizes co-packers
to produce 100% of its products as of those dates. The Company has long-standing relationships with two different co-packers
and in conjunction with the sale of its manufacturing plant we entered into a third co-packing agreement with California
Custom Beverage LLC (&ldquo;CCB&rdquo;)
 the purchaser of the plant (see Note 13). CCB is 100% owned by Chris Reed
 founder
of the Company and current Chief Information Officer and director. Although there are other packers
 a change in co-packers may
cause a delay in the production process
 which could ultimately affect operating results.

Purchases
from vendors.
 2019
 the Company&rsquo;s largest three vendors accounted for approximately
12%
 11%
 and 10% of all purchases
 respectively. During the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company&rsquo;s largest two vendors
accounted for 16% and 13% of all purchases
 respectively.

Accounts
payable.
 2019
 the Company&rsquo;s largest three vendors accounted for 19%
 15% and 14% of the total accounts
payable
 respectively. As of December 31
 2018
 one vendor accounted for 24% of total accounts payable.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company uses various inputs in determining the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities and measures these assets on
a recurring basis. Financial assets recorded at fair value are categorized by the level of subjectivity associated with the inputs
used to measure their fair value. Accounting Standards Codification Section 820 defines the following levels of subjectivity associated
with the inputs:

Level
1&mdash;Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2&mdash;Inputs
 other than the quoted prices in active markets
 that are observable either directly or indirectly.
Level
3&mdash;Unobservable inputs based on the Company&rsquo;s assumptions.

The
carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities
 such as cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 short-term bank
loans
 accounts payable
 notes payable and other payables
 approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments. The carrying values of capital lease obligations and long-term financing obligations approximate their fair values
because interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates.

As
of December 31
 2019
 and 2018
 the Company&rsquo;s balance sheets included Level 2 liabilities comprised of the fair value
of warrant liabilities aggregating $8 and $38
 respectively (see Note 9).



The
Company operates in one segment for the manufacture and distribution of our products. In accordance with the &ldquo;Segment Reporting&rdquo;
Topic of the ASC
 the Company&rsquo;s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President
who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing
guidance
 which is based on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information
quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which
the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &ldquo;Segment
Reporting&rdquo; due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services;
and procurement
 manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment
 all financial information
required by &ldquo;Segment Reporting&rdquo; can be found in the accompanying financial statements

Cost
of Goods Sold

Cost
of goods sold is comprised of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture of products
 co-packing fees
repacking fees
 in-bound freight charges
 as well as certain internal transfer costs. Additionally
 cost of goods sold includes
direct production costs in excess of charges allocated to finished goods in production. Plant costs include labor costs
 production
supplies
 repairs and maintenance
 direct inventory write-off charges and adjustments to the inventory reserve. Charges for labor
and overhead allocated to finished goods are determined on a market cost basis
 which may be lower than the actual costs incurred.
Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the period incurred rather than added to the cost of finished
goods produced. Expenses not related to the production of our products are classified as operating expenses.

The
Company terminated its manufacturing operation effective with the December 31
 2018 sale of its manufacturing plant. See
Note 13.


    
    



Delivery
and Handling Expense

Shipping
and handling costs are comprised of purchasing and receiving
 inspection
 warehousing
 transfer freight
 and other costs associated
with product distribution after manufacture and are included as part of operating expenses.

Income
Taxes

The
Company uses an asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting for income taxes that allows recognition and measurement
of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability
approach
 deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided
for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their
benefits
 or that future deductibility is uncertain. The Company&rsquo;s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related
to income tax matters in income tax expense.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&ldquo;ASC 606&rdquo;).
The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount
expected to be collected. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms
of contract(s)
 which include (1) identifying the contract or agreement with a customer
 (2) identifying our performance obligations
in the contract or agreement
 (3) determining the transaction price
 (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance
obligations
 and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.

The
Company does not have any significant contracts with customers requiring performance beyond delivery
 and contracts with customers
contain no incentives or discounts that could cause revenue to be allocated or adjusted over time. Shipping and handling activities
are performed before the customer obtains control of the goods and therefore represent a fulfillment activity rather than a promised
service to the customer. Revenue and costs of sales are recognized when control of the products transfers to our customer
 which
generally occurs upon shipment from our facilities. The Company&rsquo;s performance obligations are satisfied at that time.

All
of the Company&rsquo;s products are offered for sale as finished goods only
 and there are no performance obligations required
post-shipment for customers to derive the expected value from them.

The
Company does not allow for returns
 except for damaged products when the damage occurred pre-fulfillment. Damaged product returns
have historically been insignificant. Because of this
 the stand-alone nature of our products
 and our assessment of performance
obligations and transaction pricing for our sales contracts
 we do not currently maintain a contract asset or liability balance
for obligations. We assess our contracts and the reasonableness of our conclusions on a quarterly basis.

Loss
per Common Share

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net
income applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued
 using the treasury stock
method. Potential common shares are excluded from the computation when their effect is antidilutive.


    
    


For
the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential
dilutive securities would have had an anti-dilutive effect. The potentially dilutive securities consisted of the following:

Advertising
Costs

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and marketing expense. Advertising costs aggregated $2
570 and $300
for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Stock
Compensation Expense

The
Company periodically issues stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions
for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for such grants issued and vesting to employees based on ASC 718
 whereby
the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over
the vesting period. Such grants issued and vesting to non-employees are valued on the measurement date as determined at either
a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity
instruments is complete. In prior periods
 the Company accounted for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to
non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereby the value of the stock compensation is based upon
the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the date at which
the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. On January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) 2018-07 which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and
services from nonemployees. The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation within its Statements of Operations
with classification depending on the nature of the services rendered. The adoption of ASU 2018-07 had no cumulative effect on
previously reported amounts.

The
fair value of the Company&rsquo;s stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 which
uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock options or restricted
stock
 and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option
Pricing model and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially
affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

Warrant
Liabilities

Various
stock sales made by the Company to finance operations have been accompanied by the issuance of warrants. Some of these warrant
agreements contain fundamental transaction provisions which may give rise to an obligation of the Company to pay cash to the warrant
holders. For accounting purposes

 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
 those warrants with
fundamental transaction terms are accounted for as liabilities given the terms may give rise to an obligation of the Company to
the warrant holders. These liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting period and the change in the fair value is
recognized in earnings in the accompanying Statements of Operations.


    
    



Fair

used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect the amount of expense recorded in future periods.



In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding
lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition
approach is required for lessees for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest period presented
in the financial statements.

The
Company adopted ASU 2016-02 effective October 1
 2018. As a result
 we recorded right-of-use assets aggregating $862
 and lease
liabilities of the same amount
 as of that date. In accordance with ASU 2016-02
 the right-of-use assets are being depreciated
over the life of the underlying leases
 and monthly lease payments are being recorded as reductions to the lease liability and
imputed interest expense. See Note 7 for additional information.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements


    
    


In
June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13
 Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
(&ldquo;ASC 326&rdquo;). The standard significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial
assets
 including accounts and notes receivables. The standard will replace today&rsquo;s &ldquo;incurred loss&rdquo; approach
with an &ldquo;expected loss&rdquo; model
 under which companies will recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred
losses. Entities will apply the standard&rsquo;s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning
of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15
 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company&rsquo;s financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows.

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB
 its Emerging Issues Task Force
 the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants
 and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on
the Company&rsquo;s present or future financial statements.

At
December 31
 2019 and 2018
 intangible assets of $576
are comprised of the Virgil&rsquo;s brand name. The brand name has been assigned an indefinite life
 as we currently
anticipate that they will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized
but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life remains appropriate.
We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If further testing
is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
its fair value
 as determined by the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized
in an amount equal to that excess. Based on management&rsquo;s measurement
 there were no indications of impairment at December

On
October 4
 2018
 the Company entered into a financing agreement with Rosenthal &amp; Rosenthal
 Inc. The financing agreement
provides a maximum borrowing capacity of $13
000. Borrowings are based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable
and inventories (the &ldquo;permitted borrowings&rdquo;) plus advances (an &ldquo;over-advance&rdquo;) of up to $4
000
in excess of permitted borrowings. At December 31
 2019
 the unused borrowing capacity under the financing agreement
was $3
235. The line of credit matures on April 20
 2021.


Borrowings
under the Rosenthal financing agreement bear interest at the greater of prime or 4.75%
 plus an additional 2% to 3.5% depending
upon whether the borrowing is based upon receivables
 inventory or is an over-advance. The effective interest rate as of December
31
 2019 on outstanding borrowings was 7.1%. Additionally
 the line of credit is subject to monthly facility and administration
fees
 and aggregate minimum monthly fees (including interest) of $4.

The
line of credit is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. Additionally
 any over-advance is guaranteed
by an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit in the amount of $1
500
 issued by Daniel J. Doherty III and the Daniel J. Doherty
III 2002 Family Trust
 affiliates of Raptor/Harbor Reeds SPV LLC (&ldquo;Raptor&rdquo;). Raptor beneficially owns 14.9% of the
Company&rsquo;s outstanding common stock as of December 31
 2019. Mr. Doherty is a member of the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors.
In the event of a default under the financing agreement
 Raptor has a put option to purchase from Rosenthal the entire amount
of any outstanding over-advance plus accrued interest
 prior to Rosenthal declaring an event of default under the financing agreement.

As
part of the financing agreement in 2018
 the Company amended and restated a subordinated convertible non-redeemable
secured note to Raptor
 to provide for additional advances of up to $4
000 in the event that Raptor exercises its put option described
above (see Note 8). Consequently
 the exercise price of 750
000 of Raptor&rsquo;s outstanding warrants to purchase the
Company&rsquo;s common stock was reduced from $1.50 to $1.10
 resulting in an increase in the fair value of the warrants of $161.
This amount has been reflected as a capitalized finance cost and is being amortized over the life of the financing agreement.

The
financing agreement with Rosenthal includes customary restrictions that limit our ability to engage in certain types of transactions
including our ability to utilize tangible and intangible assets as collateral for other indebtedness. Additionally
 the agreement
contains a financial covenant that requires us to meet certain minimum working capital and tangible net worth thresholds as of
the end of each quarter. We were in compliance with the terms of our agreement with Rosenthal as of December 31
 2019.

In
2018
 the Company incurred $882 of direct costs in conjunction with the initial financing agreement
 consisting primarily of broker
bank and legal fees
 and $161 cost of warrant modification. The Company annually incurs an additional $130 of fees from the bank
which is equal to 1% of the $13
000 borrowing limit. These costs have been capitalized and recorded as a debt discount and are
being amortized over the 2.5 year life of the Rosenthal agreement. Amortization of debt discount was $323 for the year ended December
31
 2019.


7.


The
Company adopted ASU 2016-02
 Leases
 effective October 1
 2018. The standard requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset
and a corresponding lease liability at the inception of the lease
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments.
As a result
 we recorded right-of-use assets aggregating $862 as of October 1
 2018
 utilizing a discount rate of 12.60%. That
amount consists of new leases on the Company&rsquo;s Norwalk office and certain office equipment of $730
 and existing capitalized
leases reclassified to right of use assets of $132.

ASU
2016-02 requires recognition in the statement of operations of a single lease cost
 calculated so that the cost of the lease is
allocated over the lease term
 generally on a straight-line basis. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company reflected accumulated
amortization of right of use asset of $211 related to these leases
 resulting in a net asset balance of $698.

In
accordance with ASU 2016-02
 the right-of-use assets are being amortized over the life of the underlying leases.


    
    


As
of December 31
 2018
 liabilities recorded under finance leases and operating leases were $133 and $719
 respectively. During
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company made payments of $44 towards finance lease liability and $22 towards operating lease
liability. As of December 31
 2019
 the liability under finance lease amounted to $89 and the liability under operating
lease amounted to $697
 of which $21 and $28 (aggregate of $49) are reflected as the current portion of leases
payable on the accompanying balance sheet.

As
of December 31
 2019
 the weighted average remaining lease terms for operating lease and finance lease are 5.01 years and 1.00
years
 respectively. The weighted average discount rate for operating lease is 12.60% and 6.93% for finance lease.

Future
minimum lease payments under the leases are as follows (in thousands):

On
April 21
 2017
 pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement
 the Company issued a secured
 convertible
 subordinated
 non-redeemable
note in the principal amount of $3
400 (the &ldquo;Raptor Note&rdquo;) and warrants to purchase 1
416
667 shares of common stock.
The purchaser
 Raptor/Harbor Reeds SPV LLC (&ldquo;Raptor&rdquo;)
 beneficially owned approximately 14.9% and 27.1% of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock at December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

The
Raptor Note bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum
 compounded monthly. It is secured by the Company&rsquo;s assets
 subordinate
to the first priority security interest of Rosenthal &amp; Rosenthal (see Note 6). The note may not be prepaid and matures
on April 21
 2021. It may be converted
 at any time and from time to time
 into shares of common stock of the Company
 at a revised
conversion price of $1.50.

The
warrant will expire on April 21
 2022 and has an adjusted exercise price of $1.50 per share. The note and warrant contain customary
anti-dilution provisions
 and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the note and exercise of the warrant have
been registered on Form S-3. The investor was also granted the right to participate in future financing transactions of the Company
for a term of two years.

On
October 4
 2018
 in connection with the execution of the Rosenthal financing agreement
 the Company amended and restated the
subordinated convertible non-redeemable secured note to Raptor
 to provide for additional advances of up to $4
000. In consideration
therefore
 the exercise price of 750
000 of Raptor&rsquo;s outstanding warrants was reduced from $1.50 to $1.10
 resulting in
an increase in the fair value of the warrants
 determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model
 of
$161. This amount was recorded as a debt discount to the Rosenthal line of credit and is being amortized as interest expense over
the life of the financing agreement (See Note 6).

Various
financing transactions and stock sales made by the Company have been accompanied by the issuance of warrants. Generally
 we record
the fair market value of the warrants
 as determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model
 as a financing cost
at date of issuance. There were no such financing costs recorded during the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
respectively.

Certain
of our warrant agreements
 however
 contain fundamental transaction provisions which may give rise to an obligation of the Company
to pay cash to the warrant holders. For accounting purposes
 in accordance with ASC 480
 
warrants with such fundamental transaction provisions are accounted for as liabilities. A summary of transactions that impacted
our warrant liabilities is provided below under &ldquo;


    
    


Warrant
Transactions


At
December 31
 2019
 the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable warrants was zero.
The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable warrants is calculated as the difference between the exercise price
of the warrant and the market price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock as of December 31
 2019
 which was $0.91.

During
the year ended December 31
 2019
 a total of 283
495 warrants were exercised
 including 87
485 warrants that were exercised on
a cashless basis
 resulting in the issuance of 223
037 shares of our common stock. Aggregate proceeds to the Company were $365.
During the year ended December 31
 2019
 warrants to acquire 200
000 shares of common stock expired.

During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 a total of 428
005 warrants were exercised
 including 5
978 warrants that were exercised on
a cashless basis
 resulting in the issuance of 414
857 shares of our common stock. Aggregate proceeds to the Company were $831.
During the year ended December 31
 2018
 no warrants to acquire common stock expired.

Warrant
Liability

As
stated above
 certain of our warrant agreements contain fundamental transaction provisions which may give rise to an obligation
of the Company to pay cash to the warrant holders. Such warrants are accounted for as liabilities at fair value. The fair value
is remeasured at each reporting period
 and the change in the fair value is recognized in earnings in the accompanying Statements
of Operations. Following is a summary of the transactions described above that impacted our warrant liability.

The
fair value of the warrant liability was determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model at December 31
 2019 and
2018
 using the following assumptions:

Fair Value

The
risk-free interest rate is based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. The Company uses the historical volatility
of its common stock to estimate its future volatility. The expected life of the warrant is based upon its remaining contractual
life. The expected dividend yield reflects that the Company has not paid dividends to its common stockholders in the past and
does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.

The
following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the estimated fair value of the warrant liability during the years ended
December 31
 2019 and 2018:

Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock

Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock (the &ldquo;Preferred Stock&rdquo;) consists of $10 par value
 5% non-cumulative
 non-voting
 participating
preferred stock
 with a liquidation preference of $10.00 per share. 500
000 shares are authorized. As of December 31
 2019 and
2018
 there were 9
411 shares outstanding. Each share of Preferred Stock can be converted into four shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock.

Dividends
are payable at the rate of 5% annually
 pro-rata and non-cumulative. The dividend can be paid in cash or
 at the discretion of
our board of directors
 in shares of common stock based on its then fair market value. The Company cannot declare or pay any dividend
on shares of our common stock until the holders of the Preferred Stock have received their annual dividend. In addition
 the holders
of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive pro rata distributions of dividends on an &ldquo;as converted&rdquo; basis with
the holders of our common stock.

In
the event of any liquidation
 dissolution or winding up of the Company
 or if there is a change of control event as defined
 the
holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive
 prior to distributions to the holders of common stock
 $10.00 per share
plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Thereafter
 all remaining assets are distributed pro rata among all security holders. Since
June 30
 2008
 the Company has the right
 but not the obligation
 to redeem all or any portion of the Preferred Stock at $10.00
per share
 the original issue price
 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends.

The
Preferred Stock may be converted at any time
 at the option of the holder
 into four shares of common stock
 subject to adjustment
in the event of stock splits
 reverse stock splits
 stock dividends
 recapitalization
 reclassification
 and similar transactions.
The Company is obligated to reserve authorized but unissued shares of common stock sufficient to affect the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

Except
as provided by law
 the holders of the Preferred Stock do not have the right to vote on any matters
 including the election of
directors. However
 so long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding
 the Company shall not
 without the approval of a
majority of the preferred stockholders
 authorize or issue any equity security having a preference over the Preferred Stock with
respect to dividends
 liquidation
 redemption or voting
 including any other security convertible into or exercisable for any
senior preferred stock.

During
the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
on the Preferred
Stock through the issuance of 4
254 and 1
734 shares of its common stock
 respectively
 which based upon the then-current market
price of the stock equated to dividends of $5 in each of the years. No shares of Series A preferred stock were converted into
common stock in 2019 and 2018.

Management
believes that the ability to issue equity compensation
 in order to incentivize performance by employees
 directors
 and consultants
is essential to the Company&rsquo;s growth strategy.

On
September 29
 2017
 the 2017 Compensation Plan (the &ldquo;Plan&rdquo;) was approved by our shareholders. Initially it provided
for the issuance of up to 3
000
000 shares. On December 13
 2018 our shareholders approved a 3
500
000 share increase in the number
of shares issuable under the Plan. Options issued and forfeited under the 2017 plan contain an Evergreen provision and cannot
be re-priced without shareholder approval.

As
of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 shares issuable under the Plan were 3
436
864 and 1
975
215
 respectively


    
    


The
Plan permits the grant of options and stock awards to our employees
 directors and consultants. The options may constitute
either &ldquo;incentive stock options&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or &ldquo;non-qualified
stock options&rdquo;. The Plan is currently administered by the board of directors. The exercise price of an option granted under
the plan cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of common stock on the date of the grant of the option. Options
may not be granted under the plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the plan. Incentive stock options granted
to a person owning more than 10% of the combined voting power of the common stock cannot be exercisable for more than five years.
When an option is exercised
 the purchase price of the underlying stock is received in cash
 except that the plan administrator
may permit the exercise price to be paid in any combination of cash
 shares of stock having a fair market value equal to the exercise
price
 or as otherwise determined by the plan administrator.


Common
Stock Issued to Officer for Services Rendered

During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company issued 37
057 shares of its common stock to an officer of the Company as compensation
for services rendered. The shares had an aggregate value on the date of issuance of $100
 based on the market price of our common
stock on the date of grant
 which was recorded as compensation expense during the year ended December 31
There were
no issuances of common stock for services for the year ended December 31
 2019.

the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company approved options to be issued pursuant to Reed&rsquo;s 2017 Incentive Compensation
Plan to certain current employees totaling 1
258
000 shares. One half of these options vest annually over a four-year vesting
period; the other half of these options will vest based on performance criteria to be established by the board. In addition
 during
the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company granted options to purchase 113
330 shares of common stock to new board members.
Options granted to consultants
 former employees
 and board members vest at various periods. On September 11
 2019
 the Company
granted options to purchase 60
510 shares of common stock to certain consultants. None of the options granted to the consultants
to purchase 60
510 shares of common stock vested and were forfeited
 resulting in no compensation expense.

The
stock options are exercisable at a price ranging from $2.33 to $3.37 per share and expire in ten years. Total fair value of these
options at grant date was approximately $911
 which was determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the
following average assumption: stock price ranging from $2.33 to $3.37 per share
 expected term of seven years
 volatility of 61%
dividend rate of 0% and risk-free interest rate ranging from 1.39% to 2.60%. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement corresponding with the expected term of the share option award; the
expected term represents the weighted-average period of time that share option awards granted are expected to be outstanding giving
consideration to vesting schedules and historical participant exercise behavior; the expected volatility is based upon historical
volatility of the Company&rsquo;s common stock; and the expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has not
paid dividends in the past and does not expect to pay dividends in the future.


    
    


The
options issued in 2019 with a fair value of $911 which will be amortized in future periods through September 30
 2023.
During the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company recognized $790 of compensation expense relating to vested stock options.
As of December 31
 2019
 the amount of unvested compensation related to stock options was approximately $1
492 which will be recorded
as an expense in future periods as the options vest.

At
December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had available Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (&ldquo;NOL&rdquo;s)
to reduce future taxable income. For Federal purposes the amounts available were approximately $56
000 and $42
000
 respectively.
For state purposes approximately $17
000 and 18
000 was available at December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The
Federal carryforward expires on various dates through 2035 and the state carryforward expires in 2019. Given the Company&rsquo;s
history of net operating losses
 management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to
realize the tax benefit of the carryforwards. Accordingly
 the Company has not recognized a deferred tax asset for this benefit.

Due
to restrictions imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 regarding substantial changes in ownership of companies with loss
carryforwards
 the utilization of the Company&rsquo;s NOL may be limited as a result of changes in stock ownership. NOLs
incurred subsequent to the latest change in control are not subject to the limitation.

The
Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company did not have a liability
for unrecognized tax benefits.

The
Company recognizes as income tax expense
 interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions. As of December 31
 2019
 and 2018
the Company has not accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Tax years 2012 through 2019 remain open
to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.

Upon
the attainment of taxable income by the Company
 management will assess the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit associated
with the use of the NOLs and will recognize the appropriate deferred tax asset at that time.

Transactions
with California Custom Beverage
 LLC
 (&ldquo;CCB&rdquo;)

On
December 31
 2018
 the Company completed the sale of the Company&rsquo;s Los Angeles manufacturing plant to California Custom
Beverage
 LLC
 (&ldquo;CCB&rdquo;)
 an entity owned by Chris Reed
 founder
 Chief Innovation Officer and a member of our board
of directors of Reed&rsquo;s. The sales price consisted of $1
250 in cash
 and CCB assumed our lease obligation on the California
real property
 which aggregated $1
300 at December 31
 2018. The Company recognized a gain of $180 on the sale
 net of transaction
costs and other customary adjustments. Our release from the obligation by the lessor
 however
 is dependent upon CCB&rsquo;s deposit
of $1
200 of security with the lessor (see Note 14). By the terms of the sale
 CCB was to reimburse the Company for certain costs
such as sales tax arising from the transaction and prepayments. Such costs aggregated $195
 which is reflected as Receivable from
Related Party on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31
 2018
 and was collected from CCB during the year ended December
31
 2019.

Beginning
in 2019
 receive a 5% royalty on CCB&rsquo;s private
label sales to existing customers for three years and a 5% referral fee on CCB&rsquo;s private label sales to referred customers
for three years. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company recorded royalty revenue from CCB of $128 which is recorded
as a receivable at December 31
 2019. In addition
 at December 31
 2019
 the Company has outstanding receivable from CCB of $228
consisting of inventory advances to CCB.

In
2018
 we entered into a three-year co-packing agreement with CCB
 whereby CCB produces Reed&rsquo;s beverages in glass bottles
at prevailing West Coast market rates. During the year ended December 31
 2019
 purchases from CCB under our co-packing agreement
amounted to $1
600
 and at December 31
 2019
 accounts payable to CCB totaled $182.

At
December 31
 2019
Such
amount will be collected or offset against purchases from CCB during 2020.

Commitments and Contingencies

On
December 31
 2018
 the Company completed the sale of its Los Angeles manufacturing plant to CCB

 equipment
 furniture and fixtures of the manufacturing
plant. CCB assumed the monthly payments on our lease obligation effective immediately upon closing of the sale. Our release from
the obligation by the lessor
 however
 is dependent upon CCB&rsquo;s deposit of $1
200 of security with the lessor. As of December
31
 2019
 $800 has been deposited with the lessor and Mr. Reed has placed approximately 363
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31
 2019.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting


Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such term
is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer
 our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on evaluation under these criteria
 management determined
 based upon the existence of the
material weaknesses described below
 that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31
 2019.

A
material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis.

The
Company&rsquo;s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31
 2019. Management&rsquo;s assessment identified the following material weaknesses in the Company&rsquo;s internal control over
financial reporting:

Outsourced
IT Service Providers
elements of the technology infrastructure impacting its financial reporting process. Certain of these outsourced IT service providers
could not provide System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports. The Company did not have controls designed to assess the design
and operation of internal controls pertaining to these outsourced IT service providers over the period of reliance. Given that
management did not effectively assess the design and operation of certain outsourced IT service providers&rsquo; internal controls
certain of the Company&rsquo;s controls over IT systems and business processes were also ineffective
 to the extent that they
rely upon information that was subject to the outsourced IT service providers&rsquo; control environment.

Segregation
of Duties
processes. Specifically
 due to the size of the Company and the smaller nature of department teams
 opportunities are limited
to segregate duties
 resulting in inabilities to soundly manage segregation of job responsibilities.

Notwithstanding
the identified outsourced IT service providers and related COSO material weaknesses
 management has concluded that the Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly
 in all material respects
 the Company&rsquo;s financial
position
 results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP.

Weinberg&nbsp;&amp; Company
 P.A.
 our independent registered public accounting firm
 has issued an attestation report on the Company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting included herein.

Management&rsquo;s
Planned Remediation Activities

Our
management has been actively engaged in developing and implementing remediation plans to address the outsourced IT service providers
and segregation of duties material weaknesses described above. These remediation efforts are ongoing and include or are expected
to include the following:


Enhancing
                                         procedures for the identification of control activities and monitoring of control performance
                                         to ensure that the components of internal control relating to certain outsourced IT service
                                         providers are present and functioning.

Enhancing
                                         procedures and the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts to
                                         mitigate the lack of segregation of duties.



    
    


Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except
for the identification of the outsourced IT service providers and segregation of duties material weaknesses described above
 there
were no changes during the quarter ended December 31
 2019 in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

An
effective internal control system
 no matter how well designed
 has inherent limitations
 including the possibility of human error
or overriding of controls
 and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable financial reporting. Because
of its inherent limitations
 our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements
 including
the possibility of human error
 the circumvention or overriding of controls
 or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.


    
    



REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc.

Opinion
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We
have audited Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc.&rsquo;s (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
2019
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion
 because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below
on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria
 the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of&nbsp;December&nbsp;31
 2019



A
material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management&rsquo;s
assessment.

Outsourced
IT Service Providers
elements of the technology infrastructure impacting its financial reporting process. Certain of these outsourced IT service providers
could not provide System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports. The Company did not have controls designed to assess the design
and operation of internal controls pertaining to these outsourced IT service providers over the period of reliance. Given that
management did not effectively assess the design and operation of certain outsourced IT service providers&rsquo; internal controls
certain of the Company&rsquo;s controls over IT systems and business processes were also ineffective
 to the extent that they
rely upon information that was subject to the outsourced IT service providers&rsquo; control environment.

Segregation
of Duties 
processes. Specifically
 due to the size of the Company and the smaller nature of department teams
 opportunities are limited
to segregate duties
 resulting in inabilities to soundly manage segregation of job responsibilities.

We
also have audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
the balance sheets of the Company as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 and the related statements of operations
 changes in shareholders&rsquo;
equity
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes. These material weaknesses were considered in determining
the nature
 timing
 and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2019 financial statements
 and this report does not
affect our report dated March 18
 2020
 which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis
for Opinion

The
Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
 and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
 included in the accompanying Management&rsquo;s Annual Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.

Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk
 and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition
and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A
 internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&rsquo;s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the company&rsquo;s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
 and Director Independence

Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions

Our
board of directors has adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction
 arrangement or relationship
between Reed&rsquo;s and one of our executive officers
 directors
 director nominees or 5% or greater stockholders (or their immediate
family members)
 each of whom we refer to as a &ldquo;related person
&rdquo; in which such related person has a direct or indirect
material interest.

If
a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction
 arrangement or relationship
 defined as a &ldquo;related party transaction
&rdquo;
the related party must report the proposed related party transaction to our Chief Financial Officer. The policy calls for the
proposed related party transaction to be reviewed and
 if deemed appropriate
 approved by the Governance Committee. Our Governance
Committee is comprised of John Bello
 Lewis Jaffe and Scott R. Grossman. Mr. Jaffe serves as Chairman. The board of directors
has determined all of the members of the Governance Committee are independent under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market
LLC. If practicable
 the reporting
 review and approval will occur prior to entry into the transaction. If advance review
and approval is not practicable
 the Governance Committee will review
 and
 in its discretion
 may ratify the related party transaction.
Any related party transactions that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed annually at a minimum. The related party transactions
listed below were reviewed by the full board of directors. Prior to August 2005
 we did not have independent directors on our
board to review and approve related party transactions. The Governance Committee shall review future related party transactions.

The
following includes a summary of transactions since the beginning of fiscal 2019 or any currently proposed transaction
in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120
000 or one percent
of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any related person had or
will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than compensation described under &ldquo;Executive Compensation&rdquo;).
We believe the terms obtained or consideration that we paid or received
 as applicable
 in connection with the transactions described
below were comparable to or better than terms available or the amounts that would be paid or received
 as applicable
 in arm&rsquo;s-length
transactions.

Transactions
with California Custom Beverage
 LLC
 (&ldquo;CCB&rdquo;)

On
December 31
 2018
 the Company completed the sale of the Company&rsquo;s Los Angeles manufacturing plant to California Custom
Beverage
 LLC
 (&ldquo;CCB&rdquo;)
 an entity owned by Chris Reed
 founder
 Chief Innovation Officer and a member of our board
of directors of Reed&rsquo;s. By the terms of the sale
 CCB was to reimburse the Company for certain costs such as sales tax arising
from the transaction and prepayments. Such costs aggregated $195
000 which is reflected as Receivable from Related Party on the
accompanying balance sheet as of December 31
 2018
 and was collected from CCB during the year ended December 31
 2019.


Beginning
in 2019
 we are to receive a 5% royalty on CCB&rsquo;s private label sales to existing customers for three years and a 5% referral
fee on CCB&rsquo;s private label sales to referred customers for three years. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company
recorded royalty revenue from CCB of $128
000 which is recorded as a receivable at December 31
 2019. In addition
 at December
31
 2019
 the Company has outstanding receivable from CCB of $228
000 consisting of inventory advances to CCB.

In
2018
 we entered into a three-year co-packing agreement with CCB
 whereby CCB produces Reed&rsquo;s beverages in glass bottles
at prevailing West Coast market rates. During the year ended December 31
 2019
 purchases from CCB under our co-packing agreement
amounted to $1
600
00 and at December 31
 2019
 accounts payable to CCB totaled $182
000. [Please see correction to date in notes

Item
14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services

Weinberg
&amp; Company
 P.A. (&ldquo;Weinberg&rdquo;) was our independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended December
31
 2019 and 2018.

The
following table shows the fees paid or accrued by us for the audit and other services provided by Weinberg for the years ended
December 31
 2019 and 2018:

As
defined by the SEC
 (i) &ldquo;audit fees&rdquo; are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for the
audit of our annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-K
 or for services that are
normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years;
(ii) &ldquo;audit-related fees&rdquo; are fees for assurance and related services by our principal accountant that are reasonably
related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under &ldquo;audit fees;&rdquo;
(iii) &ldquo;tax fees&rdquo; are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for tax compliance
 tax advice
and tax planning; and (iv) &ldquo;all other fees&rdquo; are fees for products and services provided by our principal accountant
other than the services reported under &ldquo;audit fees
&rdquo; &ldquo;audit-related fees
&rdquo; and &ldquo;tax fees.&rdquo;

Audit
Fees

Weinberg
provided services for the audits of our financial statements included in Annual Reports on Form 10-K and limited reviews of the
financial statements included in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Audit
Related Fees

Weinberg
did not provide any professional services which would be considered &ldquo;audit related fees.&rdquo;

Tax
Fees

Weinberg
prepared our 2019 and 2018 Federal and state income tax returns.

All
Other Fees

Services
provided by Weinberg with respect to the filing of various registration statements made throughout the year are considered &ldquo;all
other fees.&rdquo;

Audit
Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

Under
the SEC&rsquo;s rules
 the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent
registered public accounting firm in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors&rsquo; independence. The SEC&rsquo;s
rules specify the types of non-audit services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the
Audit Committee&rsquo;s responsibility for administration of the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm.


    
    


Consistent
with the SEC&rsquo;s rules
 the Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve all audit services
and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to us or any of our subsidiaries.
The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee and if it does
 the decisions of that
member must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Accordingly
 100% of audit services and non-audit
services described in this Item 14 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

There
were no hours expended on the principal accountant&rsquo;s engagement to audit the registrant&rsquo;s financial statements for
the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the principal accountant&rsquo;s full-time
permanent employees.

EXECUTIVE
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

This
Employment Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) is made and effective as of December 2
 2019 (the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;)
by and between Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation (&ldquo;Reed&rsquo;s&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
 and Thomas
J. Spisak (the &ldquo;Executive&rdquo;).

WHEREAS
Reed&rsquo;s and the Executive desire to enter into this Agreement to evidence the terms and conditions of the employment of the
Executive by Reed&rsquo;s.

NOW
THEREFORE
 intending to be legally bound and in consideration of the mutual provisions set forth in this Agreement
 and for other
good and valuable consideration
 the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged
 the parties agree as follows:

Section
. Reed&rsquo;s hereby employs the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts such employment
 in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that (i) the
execution
 delivery and performance of this Agreement by Executive does not and will not conflict with
 breach
 violate or cause
a default under any contract
 agreement
 instrument
 order
 judgment or decree to which Executive is a party or by which he or
she is bound
 (ii) Executive is not a party to or bound by any employment agreement
 noncompete agreement or confidentiality agreement
with any other person or entity (other than nondisclosure agreements with Executive&rsquo;s prior employer(s)
 the terms of which
he has disclosed to the Company and which he does not expect to materially interfere with the performance of his obligations hereunder)
and (iii) upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
 this Agreement shall be the valid and binding obligation
of Executive
 enforceable in accordance with its terms. Executive hereby acknowledges and represents that he has had the opportunity
to consult with independent legal counsel regarding his or her rights and obligations under this Agreement and that he or she
fully understands the terms and conditions contained herein.

Section
. The Executive&rsquo;s employment (the &ldquo;Term&rdquo;) with Reed&rsquo;s under this Agreement will commence
on the Effective Date and continue until terminated in accordance with Section 6 below. Executive&rsquo;s employment with the
Company shall be on an &ldquo;at-will&rdquo; basis.

Section
. The Executive will be employed as the Chief Financial Officer (&ldquo;CFO&rdquo;) of Reed&rsquo;s and will
report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive will have the duties and responsibilities customarily attendant to the position
of CFO. Executive will also have such other duties and responsibilities that are commensurate with his position as specifically
delegated to him from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer. Executive shall be subject to the Bylaws
 policies
 practices
procedures and rules of the Company

 including those policies and
procedures set forth in the Company&rsquo;s Code of Conduct and Ethics. Executive&rsquo;s principal office
 and principal place
of employment

 provided that Executive may be required
under business circumstances to travel outside the location of his principal employment in connection with performing his or her
duties under this Agreement.

Section
4

. During the Executive&rsquo;s employment with Reed&rsquo;s
 the Executive will devote his full business
time and attention to the performance of his duties as CFO and will perform his duties and carry out his responsibilities as CFO
in a diligent and businesslike manner. Nothing in this Section 4.1
 however
 will prevent the Executive from engaging in additional
activities in connection with personal investments or from serving in a non-management capacity with any for profit or not for
profit organization that does not conflict with his duties under this Agreement
 provided that the Executive shall give the Board
prior notice of his service to any for profit or not for profit organization so that it may review the same for compliance with
the terms of this Agreement.


    
    


4.2
. Executive acknowledges that the information
 observations and data (including
 without limitation
trade secrets
 know-how
 research and inventions
 processes
 formulas
 technology
 designs
 drawings
 specifications
 marketing
and advertising materials
 distribution and sales methods and systems
 sales and profit figures and other technical and business
information) concerning the business or affairs of the Company or any of its affiliates obtained by him or her while employed
by the Company (&ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo;) are the property of the Company or such affiliate. Therefore
 Executive
agrees that he or she shall not disclose to any unauthorized person or use for his or her own purposes any Confidential Information
without the prior written consent of the Company
 unless and to the extent that the aforementioned matters become generally known
to and available for use by the public other than as a result of Executive&rsquo;s acts or omissions to act. Executive will deliver
to the Company at the termination of the Term
 or at any other time the Company may request
 all memoranda
 notes
 plans
 records
reports
 computer tapes
 printouts and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) to the extent containing Confidential
Information or Work Product (as defined below) of the Company or any of its affiliates which he or she may then possess or have
under his or her control.

4.3.
. Executive acknowledges that all inventions
 innovations
 improvements
 developments
 methods
 designs
analyses
 drawings
 reports and all similar or related information (whether or not patentable) which relate to the Company&rsquo;s
or any of its affiliates&rsquo; actual or anticipated business
 research and development or existing or future products or services
and which are conceived
 developed or made by Executive while employed by the Company (&ldquo;Work Product&rdquo;) belong to the
Company or such affiliate. Executive shall promptly disclose such Work Product to the Company and perform all actions requested
by the Company (whether during or after the Term) to establish and confirm such ownership (including
 without limitation
 assignments
consents
 powers of attorney and other instruments).

4.4


(a)
Executive acknowledges that Executive&rsquo;s services to the Company require the use of information including a formula
 pattern
compilation
 program
 device
 method
 technique
 or process that the Company has made reasonable efforts to keep confidential
and that derives independent economic value
 actual or potential
 from not being generally known to the public or to other persons
who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use (&ldquo;Trade Secrets&rdquo;). Executive further acknowledges and agrees
that the Company would be irreparably damaged if Executive were to provide similar services requiring the use of such Trade Secrets
to any person or entity competing with the Company or engaged in a similar business. Therefore
 Executive agrees that during the
period of Executive&rsquo;s employment with the Company or any of its affiliates and thereafter until the later of (i) three (3)
month period immediately thereafter and (ii) the expiration of the Severance Period (the &ldquo;Protection Period&rdquo;)
 he
or she will not
 either directly or indirectly
 for himself or herself or any other person or entity (i) induce or attempt to
induce any employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to leave the employ of the Company or such affiliate
 or in any way
interfere with the relationship between the Company or any affiliate and any employee thereof
 (ii) induce or attempt to induce
any customer
 supplier
 licensee
 licensor or other business relation of the Company or any affiliate to cease doing business
with the Company or such affiliate
 or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer
 supplier
 licensee
licensor or business relation and the Company or any affiliate (including
 without limitation
 making any negative statements
or communications about the Company or its affiliates) or (iii) Participate in any business in the United States that is directly
and materially competitive with the material business of the Company
 the innovation
 sale and distribution of ginger beer and
craft soda
 in which he would be reasonably likely to employ
 reveal
 or otherwise utilize Trade Secrets used by the Company prior
to the Executive&rsquo;s termination. &ldquo;Participate&rdquo; includes any direct or indirect interest in any enterprise
 whether
as an officer
 director
 employee
 partner
 sole proprietor
 agent
 representative
 independent contractor
 consultant
 executive
franchisor
 franchisee
 creditor
 owner or otherwise; provided that the foregoing activities shall not include the passive ownership
(i.e.
 Executive does not directly or indirectly participate in the business or management of the applicable entity) of less than
5% of the stock of a publicly-held corporation whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange.


    
    


(b)
Executive agrees that the aforementioned covenant contained in Section 4.4(a) is reasonable with respect to its duration
 geographical
area and scope. In particular
 Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its affiliates conduct their businesses
on a worldwide basis and that the geographic scope of the covenant contained in Section 4.4(a) is necessary to protect the goodwill
and Confidential Information of the Company and its affiliates. Executive further acknowledges that the restrictions contained
in Section 4.4(a) do not impose an undue hardship on him or her due to the fact that he or she has general business skills which
may be used in industries other than those in which each of the Company and its affiliates conduct their businesses and do not
deprive Executive of his or her livelihood. Executive agrees that the covenants made in Section 4.4(a) shall be construed as agreements
independent of any other provision(s) of this Agreement and shall survive any order of a court terminating any other provision(s)
of this Agreement.

(c)
If
 at the time of enforcement of Sections 4 of this Agreement
 a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable
under circumstances then existing
 the parties hereto agree that the maximum period
 scope or geographical area reasonable under
such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period
 scope or area.

(d)
Because Executive&rsquo;s services are unique and because Executive has access to Confidential Information and Work Product
 the
parties hereto agree that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this Agreement. Therefore
 in the event
a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement
 the Company or its successors or assigns may
 in addition to other rights and
remedies existing in their favor
 apply to any court for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce
or prevent any violations of
 the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security). In addition
 in the event of an
alleged breach or violation of this Section 4
 the Protection Period will be tolled until such breach or violation has been duly
cured. Executive agrees that the restrictions contained in Section 4 are reasonable.

4.5.
. Executive acknowledges that the provisions of Section 4 are valuable consideration as set forth
in this Agreement. Executive expressly agrees and acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Sections 4 do not preclude Executive
from earning a livelihood
 nor do they unreasonably impose limitations on Executive&rsquo;s ability to earn a living. Executive
acknowledges that he or she has carefully read this Agreement and has given careful consideration to the restraints imposed upon
Executive by this Agreement.

4.6
. As long as Executive is employed by the Company
 Executive agrees
that he or she will not
 except with the express written consent of the Company
 become engaged in
 render services for
 or permit
his or her name to be used in connection with any business other than the business of the Company or any of its affiliates.


    
    


4.7
 Executive agrees that
 following any termination of the Executive&rsquo;s employment
 Executive will continue
to provide reasonable cooperation to Reed&rsquo;s and/or any of its subsidiaries and its or their respective counsel in connection
with any investigation
 administrative proceeding
 or litigation relating to any matter that occurred during Executive&rsquo;s
employment
 in which the Executive was involved or of which the Executive has knowledge. As a condition of such cooperation
 Reed&rsquo;s
shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred at the request of Reed&rsquo;s and shall compensate
Executive at a daily rate equal to his daily rate of compensation at the time of termination of his employment. Executive also
agrees that
 in the event that the Executive is subpoenaed by any person or entity (including
 but not limited to
 any government
agency) to give testimony or provide documents (in a deposition
 court proceeding
 or otherwise) that in any way relates to the
Executive&rsquo;s employment by Reed&rsquo;s
 Executive will
 if legally permitted
 give prompt notice of such request to Reed&rsquo;s
and
 unless legally required to do so
 will make no disclosure until Reed&rsquo;s subsidiaries has had a reasonable opportunity
to contest the right of the requesting person or entity to such disclosure.

000.00 per year (the &ldquo;Base Salary&rdquo;).

periodic installments in accordance with Reed&rsquo;s customary payroll practices.

5.2


(a)
. In addition to the Base Salary
 Executive will be eligible to receive an annual or other periodic bonus for

of Bonus will be payable upon achievement and any remainder discretionary based on individual and Company performance as determined
by the Board ( &ldquo;Bonus&rdquo;). In order to be eligible to receive the Bonus
 Executive must be employed at the time of achievement
of the specific objective relating thereto and at the time Bonus payments are determined and paid by the Company. The Board and
the Executive will consult in good faith to establish the Bonus criteria for each full or partial year included in the Term starting
with the Effective Date and with the commencement of each calendar year included in the Term commencing after the Effective Date.
Any bonus earned with respect to any partial fiscal year (if any) during the Term will be prorated based upon the number of days
elapsed in such fiscal year. In order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as
amended and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively
 &ldquo;Code Section 409A&rdquo;)
 it is agreed
that the bonus (if any) earned under this Section 5.2 shall be paid no later than (but may be paid earlier in accordance with
the Company&rsquo;s usual practices) March 15th of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the fiscal
year to which such bonus relates ended.

5.3
. Executive will be entitled to four (4) weeks of paid vacation per calendar year in accordance with the Company&rsquo;s

to participate in all medical insurance and other benefit programs in effect from time to time and available to senior executives
of Reed&rsquo;s at levels commensurate with Executive&rsquo;s position as CFO. The Company will reimburse Executive for all reasonable
expenses incurred by him in the course of performing his or her duties under this Agreement which are consistent with the Company&rsquo;s
policies in effect from time to time with respect to travel
 entertainment and other business expenses
 subject to the Company&rsquo;s
requirements with respect to reporting and documentation of such expenses. To the extent that any reimbursements or in-kind benefits
under this Agreement constitute &ldquo;Non-qualified Deferred Compensation&rdquo; for purposes of Code Section 409A
 (i) all such
expenses
 benefits or other reimbursements under this Agreement shall be made on or prior to the last day of the taxable year
following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by Executive
 (ii) any right to such reimbursement or in kind
benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit
 and (iii) no such reimbursement

000 incentive stock options and (ii)

000 incentive stock options and 75
000 restricted stock awards) will vest

 the remainder (75
000 incentive stock options and 75
000 restricted stock awards)
will vest based on performance criteria to be determined by the Board or compensation committee of the Board (as the case may
be) in its sole discretion (&ldquo;Performance Equity&rdquo;). Executive is responsible for all Federal and state taxes payable
by Executive as a result of the receipt vesting and exercise of Incentive Equity Awards. The Executive will make an election under
Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to any restricted stock awards. The Executive may also make equity investments in Reed&rsquo;s
on terms that may be agreed upon by the Executive and Reed&rsquo;s.

. The Executive may terminate the Executive&rsquo;s employment with Reed&rsquo;s for Good Reason
or without Good Reason
 by written notice to Reed&rsquo;s effective no earlier than 30 days after the date of such notice if termination
is other than for Good Reason (provided that Reed&rsquo;s shall have the right to waive such 30-day notice period and accelerate
termination to any date on or after the date of such notice) and effective upon the expiration of the cure period described below
in this Section 6.2 if termination is for Good Reason. During any period between receipt of notice of termination from the Executive

 modification
or requirement constituting grounds for Good Reason. &ldquo;Good Reason&rdquo; means any material breach (whether or not specified
above) of this Agreement by Reed&rsquo;s. An event described in this Section 6.2 will not constitute Good Reason unless the Executive

or circumstance giving rise to Good Reason within 30 days of its initial existence and Reed&rsquo;s does not cure such breach
or action within 30 days after the date of the Executive&rsquo;s notice.

 without limitation
accrued vacation or paid time off
 and then unreimbursed expenses) through the date of termination of Employment (the &ldquo;Accrued
Benefits&rdquo;). No termination of employment prior to March 1
 2020 shall be considered for any purpose for Cause
 without Cause
or for Good Reason.

7.2
. If the Executive&rsquo;s employment with
Reed&rsquo;s is terminated after March 20
 2020 pursuant to Section 6.1 by Reed&rsquo;s without Cause or pursuant to Section 6.2
by the Executive for Good Reason
 the Executive will be entitled to the following:

(a)
the Accrued Benefits;

(b)
installment payments equal to the Executive&rsquo;s Base Salary in effect immediately prior to the Executive&rsquo;s termination
of employment with Reed&rsquo;s
 less applicable taxes and withholdings
 for the number of months included in the Severance Period
calculated based on length of Executive&rsquo;s continued employment with the Company immediately prior to termination (the &ldquo;Severance
Amount&rdquo;). The Executive will receive two months of severance for every full year of service
 up to a maximum of six months
(&ldquo;Severance Period&rdquo;). For clarity
 the Severance Period will not include severance for periods calculated based on
partial years of service. In addition
 to the extent permitted by applicable law
 subject to the Executive&rsquo;s election of
COBRA continuation coverage under Reed&rsquo;s group health plan
 on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of each month
during the Severance Period
 Reed&rsquo;s will pay the Executive an amount equal to the difference between the monthly COBRA premium
cost and the premium cost to the Executive as if the Executive were an employee of Reed&rsquo;s; provided
 that such payments
shall cease earlier than the expiration of the Severance Period in the event that the Executive becomes eligible to receive any
comparable health benefits
 including through a spouse&rsquo;s employer

 program
 or
arrangement of Reed&rsquo;s
 including the vested awards under the Initial Equity Grant (&ldquo;Vested Incentive Equity&rdquo;).


    
    


7.3

 by the Executive without Good Reason
is terminated after March 1
 2020 for Cause
 or by the Executive without Good Reason
 the Executive will be entitled to the Accrued
Benefits and Vested Incentive Equity.

7.4
. In the event of the termination of the Executive&rsquo;s employment with
Reed&rsquo;s pursuant to Section 6.3 as a result of death or Disability
 the Executive or the Executive&rsquo;s heirs will be
entitled to the Accrued Benefits and Vested Incentive Equity.

7.5


(a)
The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with or be exempt from Internal Revenue Code
Section 409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively &ldquo;Code Section 409A&rdquo;) and
 accordingly
to the maximum extent permitted the Employment Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith or exempt therefrom.
In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax
 interest or penalty that may be imposed on Executive
by Code Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.

(b)
A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for
the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a &ldquo;separation
from service&rdquo; within the meaning of Code Section 409A and
 for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement
 references
to a &ldquo;termination
&rdquo; &ldquo;termination of employment&rdquo; or like terms shall mean &ldquo;separation from service.&rdquo;

(c)
To the extent that any payment of base salary or other compensation is to be paid for a specified continuing period of time beyond
the date of the Executive&rsquo;s separation from service in accordance with the Company&rsquo;s payroll practices (or other similar
term)
 the payments of such base salary or other compensation shall be made in no event less frequently than monthly. Notwithstanding
the foregoing
 with respect to any payments that are intended to fall under the short-term deferral exemption from Code Section
409A
 unless this Agreement provides a specified and objectively determinable payment schedule to the contrary
 all payments due
thereunder shall be made as soon as practicable after the right to payment vests and in all events by March 15 of the calendar
year following the calendar year in which the right to payment vests. For purposes of this section
 a right to payment will be
treated as having vested when it is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as determined by the Company in its
sole discretion.

(d)
Notwithstanding any other payment schedule provided herein to the contrary
 if Executive is identified on the date of his separation
from service a &ldquo;specified employee&rdquo; within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B) (which generally
means a key employee of a corporation any stock of which is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise)
then
 with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered nonqualified deferred compensation subject
to Code Section 409A and payable on account of a &ldquo;separation from service
&rdquo; (i) such payment or benefit shall not
be made or provided until the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6) month period measured from the date
of Executive&rsquo;s &ldquo;separation from service&rdquo; and (B) the date of Executive&rsquo;s death (the &ldquo;Delay Period&rdquo;)
to the extent required under Code Section 409A and (ii) at the end of such six (6) month period
 the Company shall make an additional
payment to Executive equal to the amount interest accruing at the then-current short-term applicable federal rate published by
the Internal Revenue Service on the value of any such payment or benefit
 accruing from the date on which it would have otherwise
been paid or provided. Upon the expiration of the Delay Period
 all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section (whether
they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed
to Executive in a lump sum
 and all remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the
normal payment dates specified for them therein.


    
    


(e)
To the extent that reimbursements or other in-kind benefits under this Agreement constitute &ldquo;nonqualified deferred compensation&rdquo;
subject to Code Section 409A
 (i) all such expenses or other reimbursements hereunder shall be paid on or prior to the last day
of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by Executive
 (ii) no such reimbursement
expenses eligible for reimbursement
 or in-kind benefits provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the expenses eligible
for reimbursement
 or in-kind benefits to provided
 in any other taxable year
 and (iii) Executive&rsquo;s right to such reimbursement
or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.

(f)
For purposes of Code Section 409A
 Executive&rsquo;s right to receive any installment payment pursuant to the Employment Agreement
shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.

(g)
Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days
 the actual date of payment
within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.

(h)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary
 in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A be subject to offset
 counterclaim or recoupment by
any other amount payable to Executive unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.

7.6
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
 the Company will have no obligation to pay the Severance Amount and
Cobra Payments payable under this Section 7 during such times as Executive is in breach of Sections 4 hereof. As a condition to
the Company&rsquo;s obligations (if any) to pay the Severance Amount and Cobra Payments described in this Section 7
 Executive
 (the &ldquo;General Release&rdquo;).
Executive shall forfeit all rights to the Severance Amount and Cobra Payments described in this Section unless the General Release
is signed and delivered (and no longer subject to revocation) within thirty (30) days following the date of Executive&rsquo;s
separation from service. To the extent any such cash payment or continuing benefit to be provided is not nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Code Section 409A
 as determined by the Company in its sole discretion
 then such payment or benefit shall
commence upon the first scheduled payment date immediately after the date the release is executed and no longer subject to revocation
(the &ldquo;Release Effective Date&rdquo;). The first such cash payment shall include payment of all amounts that otherwise would
have been due prior to the Release Effective Date under the terms of this Section 7.6 applied as though such payments commenced
immediately upon Executive&rsquo;s separation from service
 and any payments made thereafter shall continue as provided herein.
The delayed benefits shall in any event expire at the time such benefits would have expired had such benefits commenced immediately
following Executive&rsquo;s separation from service. To the extent any such cash payment or continuing benefit to be provided
is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A
 as determined by the Company in its sole discretion
 then
such payments or benefits shall be made or commence upon the sixtieth (60th) day following Executive&rsquo;s separation from service.
The first such cash payment shall include payment of all amounts that otherwise would have been due prior thereto under the terms
of this Section 4(b) had such payments commenced immediately upon the Executive&rsquo;s separation from service
 and any payments
made thereafter shall continue as provided therein. The delayed benefits shall in any event expire at the time such benefits would
have expired had such benefits commenced immediately following the Executive&rsquo;s separation from service. The Company may
provide
 in its sole discretion
 that Executive may continue to participate in any benefits delayed pursuant to this section during
the period of such delay
 provided that Executive shall bear the full cost of such benefits during such delay period. Upon the
date such benefits would otherwise commence pursuant to this Section 7.6
 the Company may reimburse Executive the Company&rsquo;s
share of the cost of such benefits
 if any
 had such benefits commenced immediately upon Executive&rsquo;s separation from service.
Any remaining benefits shall be reimbursed or provided by the Company in accordance with the schedule and procedures specified
therein.

 This Agreement may not be amended
 supplemented or otherwise modified except in a writing signed by the Executive
and a director or authorized officer of Reed&rsquo;s (other than the Executive).

8.3
. The Executive and Reed&rsquo;s may (a) extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party
 (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate
 instrument or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with
any of the covenants

is to be effective. No extension or waiver will apply to any time for performance
 inaccuracy in any representation or warranty

 agreement or condition
 as the case may be
 other than that which is specified in the written
extension or waiver. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement or any of the documents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement
 and no course of dealing between the parties
 operates as a waiver of such right or remedy
and no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or further exercise of such right or remedy

intended to be exclusive
 and a party&rsquo;s rights and remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by law

successors and assigns
 except that the Executive may not assign any rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Reed&rsquo;s and Reed&rsquo;s may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Executive except in the case of an assignment of this Agreement to a successor to all or substantially
all of the business and assets of Reed&rsquo;s and its subsidiaries or any business division thereof or a restructuring of Reed&rsquo;s.

 legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way and the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid
 illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid
 legal and enforceable provision
that achieves
 to the greatest lawful extent under this Agreement
 the economic
 business and other purposes of such invalid
illegal or unenforceable provision. A court of competent jurisdiction
 if it determines any provision of this Agreement to be

 in any judicial proceeding
 a court shall deem any of the restrictive covenants invalid

hereto shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time
nor shall the failure of or delay by either of the Parties in exercising any right
 power or privilege hereunder operate as a
waiver thereof to preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right

(a)
Acknowledgment

The
Employee understands and acknowledges that by virtue of his employment with the Employer
 he had access to and knowledge of Confidential
Information
 was in a position of trust and confidence with the Employer and benefitted from the Employer&rsquo;s goodwill. The
Employee understands and acknowledges that the Employer invested significant time and expense in developing the Confidential Information
and goodwill. The Employee further understands and acknowledges that the services he provided to the Employer are unique
 special
or extraordinary.

The
Employee further understands and acknowledges that the restrictive covenants below are necessary to protect the Employer&rsquo;s
legitimate business interests in its Confidential Information and goodwill and in the Employee&rsquo;s unique
 special or extraordinary
services. The Employee further understands and acknowledges that the Employer&rsquo;s ability to reserve these for the exclusive
knowledge and use of the Employer is of great competitive importance and commercial value to the Employer and that the Employer
would be irreparably harmed if the Employee violates the restrictive covenants below.

(b)
Confidential Information.

(1)
Confidential Information. Employer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; is all confidential and/or proprietary knowledge
trade secrets
 data or information of the Employer entrusted to Employee
 whether in writing
 in computer form
 or conveyed orally
that is not generally available to others in the form in which such information is used by Employer and that gives Employer a
competitive advantage over other companies who do not have access to this information. By way of illustration but not limitation
Confidential Information includes tangible and intangible information relating to formulations

(2)
Employee understands that the above are simply examples of Employer&rsquo;s Confidential Information
 and not a complete list.
Employee further understands that as part of his duties Employee may have participated in developing Confidential Information

 disclose
 divulge
 furnish

so by lawful service of process
 subpoena

 or as he is otherwise compelled to do by law or the rules or regulations
of any regulatory body to which he is subject
 including full and complete disclosure in response thereto
 in which event he agrees
(unless prohibited by law) to provide Employer with a copy of the documents seeking disclosure of such information promptly upon
receipt of such documents and prior to their disclosure of any such information
 so that Employer may
 upon notice to Employee
take such action as Employer deems appropriate in relation to such subpoena or request and Employee (unless otherwise compelled
to do so by lawful service of process

 or by law or the rules or regulations of any regulatory body or
governmental agency or instrumentality) may not disclose any such information until Employer has had the opportunity to take such
action.

of his employment with the Employer resides with the Employer. Employee agrees that he will return to Employer or delete or destroy

Parties acknowledge and agree that:

(1)
(A) Each of the restrictive covenants contained in this Section 6 shall be construed as a separate covenant with respect to each
activity to which it applies
 (B) if
 in any judicial proceeding
 a court shall deem any of the restrictive covenants invalid
illegal
 or unenforceable because its scope is considered excessive
 such restrictive covenant shall be modified so that the scope
of the restrictive covenant is reduced only to the minimum extent necessary to render the modified covenant valid
 legal
 and
enforceable
 and (C) if any restrictive covenant (or portion thereof) is deemed invalid
 illegal
 or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
as to that jurisdiction such restrictive covenant (or portion thereof) shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity

jurisdiction or rendering that or any other restrictive covenant (or portion thereof) invalid
 illegal
 or unenforceable in any
other jurisdiction.

(2)
The Parties hereto hereby declare that it is impossible to measure in money the damages that will accrue to a Party in the event
the other Party breaches any of the restrictive covenants provided in this Section 6. In the event that a Party breaches any such
restrictive covenant
 the nonbreaching Party shall be entitled to an injunction
 a restraining order or such other equitable relief
including
 but not limited to
 specific performance (without the requirement to post bond) restraining such Party from violating
such restrictive covenant. If the nonbreaching Party shall institute any action or proceeding to enforce the restrictive covenant
the breaching Party hereby waives the claim or defense that the breaching Party has an adequate remedy at law and agrees not to
assert in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that the nonbreaching Party has an adequate remedy at law.

(3)
The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies the Parties may have
under law or in equity.

with Employer with regard to any litigation relating to Employee&rsquo;s period of employment for which Employer reasonably requests
Employee&rsquo;s participation. Employee&rsquo;s agreement to consult respecting such litigation shall continue for the duration
of any such litigation. If requested by Employer
 such cooperation shall include
 without limitation
 (1) responding reasonably
promptly to requests for information and documents in Employee&rsquo;s possession concerning matters pertinent to any of the foregoing
(2) making himself reasonably available as a witness and testifying at trial
 depositions
 hearings
 or other proceedings
 as
well as being reasonably available for adequate preparation for such testimony

reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred at the request of Employer and shall compensate Employee at a daily rate equal to his
daily rate of compensation at the time of termination of his employment. The Employee also agrees that
 in the event that the
Employee is subpoenaed by any person or entity (including
 but not limited to
 any government agency) to give testimony or provide
documents (in a deposition
 court proceeding
 or otherwise) that in any way relates to the Employee&rsquo;s employment by Employer
the Employee will
 if legally permitted
 give prompt notice of such request to Employer and
 unless legally required to do so
will make no disclosure until Employer or Employer&rsquo;s subsidiaries has had a reasonable opportunity to contest the right
of the requesting person or entity to such disclosure.

(h)
. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by either Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement
 such
Party hereby consents and agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to seek
 in addition to other available remedies
 a temporary
or permanent injunction or other equitable relief against such breach or threatened breach from any court of competent jurisdiction
without the necessity of showing any actual damages or that money damages would not afford an adequate remedy
 and without the
necessity of posting any bond or other security. The aforementioned equitable relief shall be in addition to
 not in lieu of
legal remedies
 monetary damages or other available forms of relief.

7.
. This Agreement is binding on and is for the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors
(whether by merger
 sale of assets
 reorganization or other form of business acquisition
 disposition or business reorganization)
assigns
 heirs
 executors
 administrators

hereunder may be assigned by Employee.

in this Agreement. The terms of this Agreement may be changed
 modified
 or discharged only by an instrument in writing signed
by the Parties hereto. A failure of the Employer or Employee to insist on strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement

is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable
 such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.


    
    


9.
. This Agreement shall be construed
 enforced
 and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws
of the State of California
 without regard to its choice of law provisions.

10.

is agreed to in writing and signed by the Employee and by Chief Executive Officer of the Employer. No waiver by either of the
Parties of any breach by the other Party hereto of any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by the other Party
hereto shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time
nor shall the failure of or delay by either of the Parties in exercising any right
 power or privilege hereunder operate as a
waiver thereof to preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right

EXECUTIVE
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

This
Employment Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) is made and effective as of December 2
 2019 (the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;)
by and between Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation (&ldquo;Reed&rsquo;s&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
 and Thomas
J. Spisak (the &ldquo;Executive&rdquo;).

WHEREAS
Reed&rsquo;s and the Executive desire to enter into this Agreement to evidence the terms and conditions of the employment of the
Executive by Reed&rsquo;s.

NOW
THEREFORE
 intending to be legally bound and in consideration of the mutual provisions set forth in this Agreement
 and for other
good and valuable consideration
 the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged
 the parties agree as follows:

Section
. Reed&rsquo;s hereby employs the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts such employment
 in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that (i) the
execution
 delivery and performance of this Agreement by Executive does not and will not conflict with
 breach
 violate or cause
a default under any contract
 agreement
 instrument
 order
 judgment or decree to which Executive is a party or by which he or
she is bound
 (ii) Executive is not a party to or bound by any employment agreement
 noncompete agreement or confidentiality agreement
with any other person or entity (other than nondisclosure agreements with Executive&rsquo;s prior employer(s)
 the terms of which
he has disclosed to the Company and which he does not expect to materially interfere with the performance of his obligations hereunder)
and (iii) upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
 this Agreement shall be the valid and binding obligation
of Executive
 enforceable in accordance with its terms. Executive hereby acknowledges and represents that he has had the opportunity
to consult with independent legal counsel regarding his or her rights and obligations under this Agreement and that he or she
fully understands the terms and conditions contained herein.

Section
. The Executive&rsquo;s employment (the &ldquo;Term&rdquo;) with Reed&rsquo;s under this Agreement will commence
on the Effective Date and continue until terminated in accordance with Section 6 below. Executive&rsquo;s employment with the
Company shall be on an &ldquo;at-will&rdquo; basis.

Section
. The Executive will be employed as the Chief Financial Officer (&ldquo;CFO&rdquo;) of Reed&rsquo;s and will
report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive will have the duties and responsibilities customarily attendant to the position
of CFO. Executive will also have such other duties and responsibilities that are commensurate with his position as specifically
delegated to him from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer. Executive shall be subject to the Bylaws
 policies
 practices
procedures and rules of the Company
 currently existing and as may be modified from time to time
 including those policies and
procedures set forth in the Company&rsquo;s Code of Conduct and Ethics. Executive&rsquo;s principal office
 and principal place
of employment
 shall be at the Company&rsquo;s offices
 currently in Norwalk
 Connecticut
 provided that Executive may be required
under business circumstances to travel outside the location of his principal employment in connection with performing his or her
duties under this Agreement.

Section
4 


    
    


4.1
. During the Executive&rsquo;s employment with Reed&rsquo;s
 the Executive will devote his full business
time and attention to the performance of his duties as CFO and will perform his duties and carry out his responsibilities as CFO
in a diligent and businesslike manner. Nothing in this Section 4.1
 however
 will prevent the Executive from engaging in additional
activities in connection with personal investments or from serving in a non-management capacity with any for profit or not for
profit organization that does not conflict with his duties under this Agreement
 provided that the Executive shall give the Board
prior notice of his service to any for profit or not for profit organization so that it may review the same for compliance with
the terms of this Agreement.

4.2
. Executive acknowledges that the information
 observations and data (including
 without limitation
trade secrets
 know-how
 research and inventions
 processes
 formulas
 technology
 designs
 drawings
 specifications
 marketing
and advertising materials
 distribution and sales methods and systems
 sales and profit figures and other technical and business
information) concerning the business or affairs of the Company or any of its affiliates obtained by him or her while employed
by the Company (&ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo;) are the property of the Company or such affiliate. Therefore
 Executive
agrees that he or she shall not disclose to any unauthorized person or use for his or her own purposes any Confidential Information
without the prior written consent of the Company
 unless and to the extent that the aforementioned matters become generally known
to and available for use by the public other than as a result of Executive&rsquo;s acts or omissions to act. Executive will deliver
to the Company at the termination of the Term
 or at any other time the Company may request
 all memoranda
 notes
 plans
 records
reports
 computer tapes
 printouts and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) to the extent containing Confidential
Information or Work Product (as defined below) of the Company or any of its affiliates which he or she may then possess or have
under his or her control.

4.3.
. Executive acknowledges that all inventions
 innovations
 improvements
 developments
 methods
 designs
analyses
 drawings
 reports and all similar or related information (whether or not patentable) which relate to the Company&rsquo;s
or any of its affiliates&rsquo; actual or anticipated business
 research and development or existing or future products or services
and which are conceived
 developed or made by Executive while employed by the Company (&ldquo;Work Product&rdquo;) belong to the
Company or such affiliate. Executive shall promptly disclose such Work Product to the Company and perform all actions requested
by the Company (whether during or after the Term) to establish and confirm such ownership (including
 without limitation
 assignments
consents
 powers of attorney and other instruments).

4.4


(a)
Executive acknowledges that Executive&rsquo;s services to the Company require the use of information including a formula
 pattern
compilation
 program
 device
 method
 technique
 or process that the Company has made reasonable efforts to keep confidential
and that derives independent economic value
 actual or potential
 from not being generally known to the public or to other persons
who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use (&ldquo;Trade Secrets&rdquo;). Executive further acknowledges and agrees
that the Company would be irreparably damaged if Executive were to provide similar services requiring the use of such Trade Secrets
to any person or entity competing with the Company or engaged in a similar business. Therefore
 Executive agrees that during the
period of Executive&rsquo;s employment with the Company or any of its affiliates and thereafter until the later of (i) three (3)
month period immediately thereafter and (ii) the expiration of the Severance Period (the &ldquo;Protection Period&rdquo;)
 he
or she will not
 either directly or indirectly
 for himself or herself or any other person or entity (i) induce or attempt to
induce any employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to leave the employ of the Company or such affiliate
 or in any way
interfere with the relationship between the Company or any affiliate and any employee thereof
 (ii) induce or attempt to induce
any customer
 supplier
 licensee
 licensor or other business relation of the Company or any affiliate to cease doing business
with the Company or such affiliate
 or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer
 supplier
 licensee
licensor or business relation and the Company or any affiliate (including
 without limitation
 making any negative statements
or communications about the Company or its affiliates) or (iii) Participate in any business in the United States that is directly
and materially competitive with the material business of the Company
 the innovation
 sale and distribution of ginger beer and
craft soda
 in which he would be reasonably likely to employ
 reveal
 or otherwise utilize Trade Secrets used by the Company prior
to the Executive&rsquo;s termination. &ldquo;Participate&rdquo; includes any direct or indirect interest in any enterprise
 whether
as an officer
 director
 employee
 partner
 sole proprietor
 agent
 representative
 independent contractor
 consultant
 executive
franchisor
 franchisee
 creditor
 owner or otherwise; provided that the foregoing activities shall not include the passive ownership
(i.e.
 Executive does not directly or indirectly participate in the business or management of the applicable entity) of less than
5% of the stock of a publicly-held corporation whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange.


    
    


(b)
Executive agrees that the aforementioned covenant contained in Section 4.4(a) is reasonable with respect to its duration
 geographical
area and scope. In particular
 Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its affiliates conduct their businesses
on a worldwide basis and that the geographic scope of the covenant contained in Section 4.4(a) is necessary to protect the goodwill
and Confidential Information of the Company and its affiliates. Executive further acknowledges that the restrictions contained
in Section 4.4(a) do not impose an undue hardship on him or her due to the fact that he or she has general business skills which
may be used in industries other than those in which each of the Company and its affiliates conduct their businesses and do not
deprive Executive of his or her livelihood. Executive agrees that the covenants made in Section 4.4(a) shall be construed as agreements
independent of any other provision(s) of this Agreement and shall survive any order of a court terminating any other provision(s)
of this Agreement.

(c)
If
 at the time of enforcement of Sections 4 of this Agreement
 a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable
under circumstances then existing
 the parties hereto agree that the maximum period
 scope or geographical area reasonable under
such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period
 scope or area.

(d)
Because Executive&rsquo;s services are unique and because Executive has access to Confidential Information and Work Product
 the
parties hereto agree that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of this Agreement. Therefore
 in the event
a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement
 the Company or its successors or assigns may
 in addition to other rights and
remedies existing in their favor
 apply to any court for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce
or prevent any violations of
 the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security). In addition
 in the event of an
alleged breach or violation of this Section 4
 the Protection Period will be tolled until such breach or violation has been duly
cured. Executive agrees that the restrictions contained in Section 4 are reasonable.

4.5.
. Executive acknowledges that the provisions of Section 4 are valuable consideration as set forth
in this Agreement. Executive expressly agrees and acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Sections 4 do not preclude Executive
from earning a livelihood
 nor do they unreasonably impose limitations on Executive&rsquo;s ability to earn a living. Executive
acknowledges that he or she has carefully read this Agreement and has given careful consideration to the restraints imposed upon
Executive by this Agreement.

4.6
. As long as Executive is employed by the Company
 Executive agrees
that he or she will not
 except with the express written consent of the Company
 become engaged in
 render services for
 or permit
his or her name to be used in connection with any business other than the business of the Company or any of its affiliates.


    
    


4.7
 Executive agrees that
 following any termination of the Executive&rsquo;s employment
 Executive will continue
to provide reasonable cooperation to Reed&rsquo;s and/or any of its subsidiaries and its or their respective counsel in connection
with any investigation
 administrative proceeding
 or litigation relating to any matter that occurred during Executive&rsquo;s
employment
 in which the Executive was involved or of which the Executive has knowledge. As a condition of such cooperation
 Reed&rsquo;s
shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred at the request of Reed&rsquo;s and shall compensate
Executive at a daily rate equal to his daily rate of compensation at the time of termination of his employment. Executive also
agrees that
 in the event that the Executive is subpoenaed by any person or entity (including
 but not limited to
 any government
agency) to give testimony or provide documents (in a deposition
 court proceeding
 or otherwise) that in any way relates to the
Executive&rsquo;s employment by Reed&rsquo;s
 Executive will
 if legally permitted
 give prompt notice of such request to Reed&rsquo;s
and
 unless legally required to do so
 will make no disclosure until Reed&rsquo;s subsidiaries has had a reasonable opportunity
to contest the right of the requesting person or entity to such disclosure.

Section
5 Compensation.

5.1
. The Executive will be paid a base salary at the rate of $250
000.00 per year (the &ldquo;Base Salary&rdquo;).
The Base Salary shall be subject to annual review in the sole discretion of the Board. The Base Salary will be payable in equal
periodic installments in accordance with Reed&rsquo;s customary payroll practices.

5.2


(a)
. In addition to the Base Salary
 Executive will be eligible to receive an annual or other periodic bonus for
each partial or full calendar year (which may
 to the extent not relating to achievement of a specific objective established by
the Board in consultation with the Executive as provided below
 be pro-rated for partial calendar years) included in the Term
at a target amount equal to 30% of then current Base Salary payable and based upon performance criteria to be established by the
Board in consultation with the Executive
 which are anticipated to consist of specific objectives for which specified portions
of Bonus will be payable upon achievement and any remainder discretionary based on individual and Company performance as determined
by the Board ( &ldquo;Bonus&rdquo;). In order to be eligible to receive the Bonus
 Executive must be employed at the time of achievement
of the specific objective relating thereto and at the time Bonus payments are determined and paid by the Company. The Board and
the Executive will consult in good faith to establish the Bonus criteria for each full or partial year included in the Term starting
with the Effective Date and with the commencement of each calendar year included in the Term commencing after the Effective Date.
Any bonus earned with respect to any partial fiscal year (if any) during the Term will be prorated based upon the number of days
elapsed in such fiscal year. In order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as
amended and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively
 &ldquo;Code Section 409A&rdquo;)
 it is agreed
that the bonus (if any) earned under this Section 5.2 shall be paid no later than (but may be paid earlier in accordance with
the Company&rsquo;s usual practices) March 15th of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the fiscal
year to which such bonus relates ended.

5.3
. Executive will be entitled to four (4) weeks of paid vacation per calendar year in accordance with the Company&rsquo;s
vacation and paid time off policy
 inclusive of vacation days and sick days and excluding standard paid Company holidays
 in the
same manner as paid time off days for employees of the Company generally accrue. The Executive and his dependents will be entitled
to participate in all medical insurance and other benefit programs in effect from time to time and available to senior executives
of Reed&rsquo;s at levels commensurate with Executive&rsquo;s position as CFO. The Company will reimburse Executive for all reasonable
expenses incurred by him in the course of performing his or her duties under this Agreement which are consistent with the Company&rsquo;s
policies in effect from time to time with respect to travel
 entertainment and other business expenses
 subject to the Company&rsquo;s
requirements with respect to reporting and documentation of such expenses. To the extent that any reimbursements or in-kind benefits
under this Agreement constitute &ldquo;Non-qualified Deferred Compensation&rdquo; for purposes of Code Section 409A
 (i) all such
expenses
 benefits or other reimbursements under this Agreement shall be made on or prior to the last day of the taxable year
following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by Executive
 (ii) any right to such reimbursement or in kind
benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit
 and (iii) no such reimbursement
 expenses eligible for
reimbursement
 or in-kind benefits provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement
or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.


    
    


5.4
. Executive shall be eligible to receive an initial equity award of (i) 150
000 incentive stock options and (ii)
150
000 restricted stock awards ((i) and (ii)
 the &ldquo;Initial Equity Award&rdquo;) ninety (90) days after the Effective Date
(&ldquo;Grant Date&rdquo;)
 in accordance with the terms and conditions of available plan and subject to Board approval and plan
availability. Of the Initial Equity Award
 one-half (75
000 incentive stock options and 75
000 restricted stock awards) will vest
in equal increments of 18
750 on each of the first
 second
 third and fourth anniversaries of the Grant Date (&ldquo;Incentive
Equity&rdquo;). Of the Initial Equity Award
 the remainder (75
000 incentive stock options and 75
000 restricted stock awards)
will vest based on performance criteria to be determined by the Board or compensation committee of the Board (as the case may
be) in its sole discretion (&ldquo;Performance Equity&rdquo;). Executive is responsible for all Federal and state taxes payable
by Executive as a result of the receipt vesting and exercise of Incentive Equity Awards. The Executive will make an election under
Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to any restricted stock awards. The Executive may also make equity investments in Reed&rsquo;s
on terms that may be agreed upon by the Executive and Reed&rsquo;s.

Section
6 

6.1
. Reed&rsquo;s may terminate the Executive&rsquo;s employment with Reed&rsquo;s for Cause or
without Cause
 effective immediately on the day Reed&rsquo;s gives notice of such termination to the Executive. For purposes of
this Agreement

of Directors; or (vi) any disqualifying event causing Company &ldquo;bad actor&rdquo; disqualification under Rule 506(d) of the
Securities Act of 1933
 as amended.

6.2
. The Executive may terminate the Executive&rsquo;s employment with Reed&rsquo;s for Good Reason
or without Good Reason
 by written notice to Reed&rsquo;s effective no earlier than 30 days after the date of such notice if termination
is other than for Good Reason (provided that Reed&rsquo;s shall have the right to waive such 30-day notice period and accelerate
termination to any date on or after the date of such notice) and effective upon the expiration of the cure period described below
in this Section 6.2 if termination is for Good Reason. During any period between receipt of notice of termination from the Executive

 duties
 and responsibilities
and may require the Executive&rsquo;s absence from Reed&rsquo;s offices without any such suspension
 reduction
 modification
or requirement constituting grounds for Good Reason. &ldquo;Good Reason&rdquo; means any material breach (whether or not specified
above) of this Agreement by Reed&rsquo;s. An event described in this Section 6.2 will not constitute Good Reason unless the Executive
provides written notice to Reed&rsquo;s of the Executive&rsquo;s intention to resign for Good Reason and specifying the event
or circumstance giving rise to Good Reason within 30 days of its initial existence and Reed&rsquo;s does not cure such breach
or action within 30 days after the date of the Executive&rsquo;s notice.


    
    


6.3
. The Executive&rsquo;s employment under this Agreement will terminate upon the Executive&rsquo;s death.

 Reed&rsquo;s may terminate the Executive&rsquo;s employment with Reed&rsquo;s by written notice to the Executive
due to Disability. For purposes of this Agreement

 with or
without reasonable accommodation and due to physical or mental incapacity
 to substantially perform the essential functions of
his duties for 60 days
 whether consecutive or non-consecutive
 within any calendar year.

6.4
. This Agreement will terminate when all obligations of the parties under this Agreement have been
satisfied.

6.5
. Upon any termination of the Executive&rsquo;s employment hereunder for any reason
 except as may otherwise

and officer positions that he holds with Reed&rsquo;s or any of its subsidiaries.

Section
7 

7.1

 2020

 2020
 the Executive shall be entitled to accrued and unpaid compensation and benefits (including
 without limitation
accrued vacation or paid time off
 and then unreimbursed expenses) through the date of termination of Employment (the &ldquo;Accrued
Benefits&rdquo;). No termination of employment prior to March 1
 2020 shall be considered for any purpose for Cause
 without Cause
or for Good Reason.

7.2
. If the Executive&rsquo;s employment with
Reed&rsquo;s is terminated after March 20
 2020 pursuant to Section 6.1 by Reed&rsquo;s without Cause or pursuant to Section 6.2
by the Executive for Good Reason
 the Executive will be entitled to the following:

(a)
the Accrued Benefits;

(b)
installment payments equal to the Executive&rsquo;s Base Salary in effect immediately prior to the Executive&rsquo;s termination
of employment with Reed&rsquo;s
 less applicable taxes and withholdings
 for the number of months included in the Severance Period
calculated based on length of Executive&rsquo;s continued employment with the Company immediately prior to termination (the &ldquo;Severance
Amount&rdquo;). The Executive will receive two months of severance for every full year of service
 up to a maximum of six months
(&ldquo;Severance Period&rdquo;). For clarity
 the Severance Period will not include severance for periods calculated based on
partial years of service. In addition
 to the extent permitted by applicable law
 subject to the Executive&rsquo;s election of
COBRA continuation coverage under Reed&rsquo;s group health plan
 on the first regularly scheduled payroll date of each month
during the Severance Period
 Reed&rsquo;s will pay the Executive an amount equal to the difference between the monthly COBRA premium
cost and the premium cost to the Executive as if the Executive were an employee of Reed&rsquo;s; provided
 that such payments
shall cease earlier than the expiration of the Severance Period in the event that the Executive becomes eligible to receive any
comparable health benefits
 including through a spouse&rsquo;s employer
 during the Severance Period (the &ldquo;COBRA Payments&rdquo;).
Executive will notify Reed&rsquo;s of Executive&rsquo;s eligibility for health benefits during the Severance Period within 15
days of such eligibility; and

any and all rights he may have as a holder of vested equity interests in Reed&rsquo;s or under any applicable plan
 program
 or
arrangement of Reed&rsquo;s
 including the vested awards under the Initial Equity Grant (&ldquo;Vested Incentive Equity&rdquo;).

7.3

 by the Executive without Good Reason
is terminated after March 1
 2020 for Cause
 or by the Executive without Good Reason
 the Executive will be entitled to the Accrued
Benefits and Vested Incentive Equity.

7.4
. In the event of the termination of the Executive&rsquo;s employment with
Reed&rsquo;s pursuant to Section 6.3 as a result of death or Disability
 the Executive or the Executive&rsquo;s heirs will be
entitled to the Accrued Benefits and Vested Incentive Equity.

7.5


(a)
The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with or be exempt from Internal Revenue Code
Section 409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively &ldquo;Code Section 409A&rdquo;) and
 accordingly
to the maximum extent permitted the Employment Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith or exempt therefrom.
In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax
 interest or penalty that may be imposed on Executive
by Code Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.

(b)
A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for
the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a &ldquo;separation
from service&rdquo; within the meaning of Code Section 409A and
 for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement
 references
to a &ldquo;termination
&rdquo; &ldquo;termination of employment&rdquo; or like terms shall mean &ldquo;separation from service.&rdquo;

(c)
To the extent that any payment of base salary or other compensation is to be paid for a specified continuing period of time beyond
the date of the Executive&rsquo;s separation from service in accordance with the Company&rsquo;s payroll practices (or other similar
term)
 the payments of such base salary or other compensation shall be made in no event less frequently than monthly. Notwithstanding
the foregoing
 with respect to any payments that are intended to fall under the short-term deferral exemption from Code Section
409A
 unless this Agreement provides a specified and objectively determinable payment schedule to the contrary
 all payments due
thereunder shall be made as soon as practicable after the right to payment vests and in all events by March 15 of the calendar
year following the calendar year in which the right to payment vests. For purposes of this section
 a right to payment will be
treated as having vested when it is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as determined by the Company in its
sole discretion.


    
    


(d)
Notwithstanding any other payment schedule provided herein to the contrary
 if Executive is identified on the date of his separation
from service a &ldquo;specified employee&rdquo; within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B) (which generally
means a key employee of a corporation any stock of which is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise)
then
 with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered nonqualified deferred compensation subject
to Code Section 409A and payable on account of a &ldquo;separation from service
&rdquo; (i) such payment or benefit shall not
be made or provided until the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6) month period measured from the date
of Executive&rsquo;s &ldquo;separation from service&rdquo; and (B) the date of Executive&rsquo;s death (the &ldquo;Delay Period&rdquo;)
to the extent required under Code Section 409A and (ii) at the end of such six (6) month period
 the Company shall make an additional
payment to Executive equal to the amount interest accruing at the then-current short-term applicable federal rate published by
the Internal Revenue Service on the value of any such payment or benefit
 accruing from the date on which it would have otherwise
been paid or provided. Upon the expiration of the Delay Period
 all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section (whether
they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed
to Executive in a lump sum
 and all remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the
normal payment dates specified for them therein.

(e)
To the extent that reimbursements or other in-kind benefits under this Agreement constitute &ldquo;nonqualified deferred compensation&rdquo;
subject to Code Section 409A
 (i) all such expenses or other reimbursements hereunder shall be paid on or prior to the last day
of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by Executive
 (ii) no such reimbursement
expenses eligible for reimbursement
 or in-kind benefits provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the expenses eligible
for reimbursement
 or in-kind benefits to provided
 in any other taxable year
 and (iii) Executive&rsquo;s right to such reimbursement
or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.

(f)
For purposes of Code Section 409A
 Executive&rsquo;s right to receive any installment payment pursuant to the Employment Agreement
shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.
(g)
Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days
 the actual date of payment
within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.

(h)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary
 in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A be subject to offset
 counterclaim or recoupment by
any other amount payable to Executive unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.


    
    


7.6
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
 the Company will have no obligation to pay the Severance Amount and
Cobra Payments payable under this Section 7 during such times as Executive is in breach of Sections 4 hereof. As a condition to
the Company&rsquo;s obligations (if any) to pay the Severance Amount and Cobra Payments described in this Section 7
 Executive
 (the &ldquo;General Release&rdquo;).
Executive shall forfeit all rights to the Severance Amount and Cobra Payments described in this Section unless the General Release
is signed and delivered (and no longer subject to revocation) within thirty (30) days following the date of Executive&rsquo;s
separation from service. To the extent any such cash payment or continuing benefit to be provided is not nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Code Section 409A
 as determined by the Company in its sole discretion
 then such payment or benefit shall
commence upon the first scheduled payment date immediately after the date the release is executed and no longer subject to revocation
(the &ldquo;Release Effective Date&rdquo;). The first such cash payment shall include payment of all amounts that otherwise would
have been due prior to the Release Effective Date under the terms of this Section 7.6 applied as though such payments commenced
immediately upon Executive&rsquo;s separation from service
 and any payments made thereafter shall continue as provided herein.
The delayed benefits shall in any event expire at the time such benefits would have expired had such benefits commenced immediately
following Executive&rsquo;s separation from service. To the extent any such cash payment or continuing benefit to be provided
is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A
 as determined by the Company in its sole discretion
 then
such payments or benefits shall be made or commence upon the sixtieth (60th) day following Executive&rsquo;s separation from service.
The first such cash payment shall include payment of all amounts that otherwise would have been due prior thereto under the terms
of this Section 4(b) had such payments commenced immediately upon the Executive&rsquo;s separation from service
 and any payments
made thereafter shall continue as provided therein. The delayed benefits shall in any event expire at the time such benefits would
have expired had such benefits commenced immediately following the Executive&rsquo;s separation from service. The Company may
provide
 in its sole discretion
 that Executive may continue to participate in any benefits delayed pursuant to this section during
the period of such delay
 provided that Executive shall bear the full cost of such benefits during such delay period. Upon the
date such benefits would otherwise commence pursuant to this Section 7.6
 the Company may reimburse Executive the Company&rsquo;s
share of the cost of such benefits
 if any
 had such benefits commenced immediately upon Executive&rsquo;s separation from service.
Any remaining benefits shall be reimbursed or provided by the Company in accordance with the schedule and procedures specified
therein.

 This Agreement may not be amended
 supplemented or otherwise modified except in a writing signed by the Executive
and a director or authorized officer of Reed&rsquo;s (other than the Executive).


    
    


8.3
. The Executive and Reed&rsquo;s may (a) extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party

this Agreement or in any certificate

any of the covenants
 agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or
waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written document signed on behalf of the party against whom the waiver or extension
is to be effective. No extension or waiver will apply to any time for performance
 inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
or noncompliance with any covenant
 agreement or condition
 as the case may be
 other than that which is specified in the written
extension or waiver. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement or any of the documents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement
 and no course of dealing between the parties
 operates as a waiver of such right or remedy
and no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or further exercise of such right or remedy
or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any enumeration of a party&rsquo;s rights and remedies in this Agreement is not
intended to be exclusive
 and a party&rsquo;s rights and remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by law
and include any rights and remedies authorized in law or in equity. 

8.4

written consent of the Executive except in the case of an assignment of this Agreement to a successor to all or substantially
all of the business and assets of Reed&rsquo;s and its subsidiaries or any business division thereof or a restructuring of Reed&rsquo;s.
The Executive&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement are personal to the Executive and may not be delegated.

8.6
. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
 illegal or unenforceable
 the validity
 legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way and the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid
 illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid
 legal and enforceable provision
that achieves
 to the greatest lawful extent under this Agreement
 the economic
 business and other purposes of such invalid
illegal or unenforceable provision. A court of competent jurisdiction
 if it determines any provision of this Agreement to be
unreasonable in scope
 time or geography
 is hereby authorized by the Executive and Reed&rsquo;s to enforce the same in such narrower
scope
 shorter time or lesser geography as such court determines to be reasonable and proper under all the circumstances.

8.7
. The validity
 interpretation

by the laws of the Connecticut without giving effect to any choice of law rules or other conflicting provision or rule that would
cause the laws of any jurisdiction to be applied. Reed&rsquo;s and the Executive agree that any and all disputes arising out of

 Connecticut to enforce any arbitration
award rendered with respect thereto. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator as agreed upon between Reed&rsquo;s

from a panel provided by the American Arbitration Association. The costs of the arbitrator along with other arbitration-specific
fees shall be borne equally by the parties. Each party shall bear its own attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses; provided that the
arbitrator may assess the prevailing party&rsquo;s fees and costs against the non-prevailing party as part of the arbitrator&rsquo;s
award. The parties agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such proceedings. Such decisions and awards rendered
by the arbitrators shall be final and conclusive. All such disputes shall be settled in this manner in lieu of any action at law
or equity; provided
 however
 that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as precluding the bringing an action for injunctive
relief or specific performance as provided in this Agreement.


    
    


8.8
. The respective rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall survive any termination of this Agreement
to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and obligations and to the extent that any performance is
required following termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 local
non-U.S. or otherwise) to the extent required by applicable law.

 Reed&amp;#8217;s is&#13;America&amp;#8217;s best-selling Ginger Beer brand and has been the leader and innovator in the ginger beer category for decades. Virgil&amp;#8217;s&#13;is America&amp;#8217;s best-selling independent
 full line of natural craft sodas. The Reed&amp;#8217;s Inc. portfolio is sold in over&#13;30
000 retail stores nationwide. Reed&amp;#8217;s Ginger Beers are unique due to the proprietary process of using fresh ginger root&#13;combined with a Jamaican inspired recipe of natural spices and fruit juices. The Company uses this same handcrafted approach in&#13;its award-winning Virgil&amp;#8217;s line of great tasting

 2019
 the Company recorded&#13;a net loss of $16
112 and used cash in operations of $18
161. As of December 31
 2019
 we had a cash balance of $913 with borrowing&#13;capacity of $3
235
 stockholders&amp;#8217; equity of $1
147 and a working capital of $4
885. Notwithstanding the net loss for 2019

 the Company performed a complete operational&#13;review and developed a detailed action plan to capture performance improvements
 drive core brand growth
 and become a premier&#13;&amp;#8220;asset-light&amp;#8221; sales and marketing organization. In September 2018
 the Company completed the relocation of its headquarters&#13;to Norwalk
 Connecticut. In December 2018
 the Company sold its Los Angeles manufacturing plant to a related party (see Note 13)
&#13;marking a fundamental shift in the nature of the Company&amp;#8217;s operations and effectively eliminated our costs associated with&#13;excess manufacturing capacity. With the sale of our manufacturing plant
 all of the Company&amp;#8217;s production is subcontracted&#13;to co-packers
 which assemble our products and charge us a fee
 generally by the case

 the Company entered into a&#13;financing agreement with Rosenthal &amp;#38; Rosenthal
 Inc.
 which replaced an existing credit facility (see Note 6). The Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;annual debt service requirements
 on an annualized basis
 were reduced by approximately $1
500 as a result of the refinancing.&#13;The current credit facility is for a term of 2.5 years
 and provides for borrowings of up to $13
000. As of December 31
 2019 and&#13;2018
 the Company had $3
235 and $1
201
 respectively

 2019
 the Company conducted&#13;a public offering of 7
733
750 shares of its common stock at $2.10 per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $14

 2019
 the Company conducted&#13;a public offering of 13
416
667 shares of its common stock at $0.60 per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $7

 we have financed our operations&#13;through public and private sales of common stock
 issuance of preferred and common stock
 convertible debt instruments
 term loans&#13;and credit lines from financial institutions
 and cash generated from operations. We have taken decisive action to improve our&#13;margins
 including fully outsourcing our manufacturing process
 streamlining our product portfolio


 disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
&#13;and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.&#13;Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciable lives&#13;of property and equipment
 analysis of impairments of recorded long-term tangible and intangible assets
 realization of deferred&#13;tax assets

 a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces&#13;the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer&#13;identification of potential bad debts

 2019 and 2018
 the&#13;allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts was $375 and $623

 general market conditions or other factors
 which may result in cancellations of advance orders&#13;or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers. Additionally
 our management&amp;#8217;s estimates of future product demand&#13;may be inaccurate
 which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. At&#13;December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the reserve for inventory obsolescence aggregated $646 and $197


 2018 (see Note 13)

 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and&#13;its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized&#13;to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018

 so classified because we anticipate that these brand names will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually.&#13;Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine&#13;whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. As part of our impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine&#13;whether it is more likely than not the asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value&#13;of our asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined by its discounted cash&#13;flows

 2019
 the Company&#13;determined there was no impairment of its indefinite-lived brand names. During our December 31
 2018 impairment testing
 we determined&#13;that our Sonoma Sparkler trademark was unlikely to provide future benefit to the Company
 because we do not currently offer Sonoma&#13;Sparkler products and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly
 we reduced the book value of this asset&#13;to zero as of December 31
 2018

 the Company&amp;#8217;s policy&#13;is to minimize borrowing costs by immediately applying cash receipts to borrowings against its credit facility. From time to time
&#13;however
 the Company may be exposed to risk for the amounts of funds held in bank accounts in excess of the FDIC limit. To minimize&#13;the risk

 2019
 the Company&amp;#8217;s largest two customers accounted for 12% and 11% of gross sales
 respectively. During the year ended&#13;December 31
 2018
 the largest two customers accounted for 24% and 17% of gross sales

 2019
 the Company had accounts receivable from one customer which comprised 14% of its gross accounts receivable. As of December&#13;31
 2018
 accounts receivable from two customers comprised 36% and 19% of total accounts receivable

 2019 and&#13;2018
 respectively
 the Company utilized four and three
 respectively
 separate
 co-packers for most its production and bottling&#13;of beverage products in the eastern United States. With the December 31
 2018 sale of its manufacturing plant
 the Company no longer&#13;conducts a manufacturing operation
 accordingly it utilizes co-packers to produce 100% of its products as of those dates. The Company&#13;has long-standing relationships with two different co-packers
 and in conjunction with the sale of its manufacturing plant we entered&#13;into a third co-packing agreement with California Custom Beverage LLC (&amp;#8220;CCB&amp;#8221;)
 the purchaser of the plant (see Note&#13;13). CCB is 100% owned by Chris Reed
 founder of the Company and current Chief Information Officer and director. Although there&#13;are other packers
 a change in co-packers may cause a delay in the production process

 2019
 the Company&amp;#8217;s largest three vendors accounted for approximately 12%
 11%
 and 10% of all purchases

 the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President
 who reviews operating results&#13;to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance
 which is based&#13;on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to&#13;report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which the entity holds&#13;material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &amp;#8220;Segment Reporting&amp;#8221;&#13;due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement

 deferred taxes are provided for the net&#13;tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and&#13;the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not&#13;these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits

 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&amp;#8220;ASC 606&amp;#8221;). The underlying principle of ASC 606&#13;is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606&#13;creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contract(s)
 which include&#13;(1) identifying the contract or agreement with a customer
 (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement
&#13;(3) determining the transaction price
 (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations

 and contracts with customers contain no incentives or discounts that could&#13;cause revenue to be allocated or adjusted over time. Shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains&#13;control of the goods and therefore represent a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service to the customer. Revenue and&#13;costs of sales are recognized when control of the products transfers to our customer


 except&#13;for damaged products when the damage occurred pre-fulfillment. Damaged product returns have historically been insignificant. Because&#13;of this
 the stand-alone nature of our products
 and our assessment of performance obligations and transaction pricing for our&#13;sales contracts

Such grants issued&#13;and vesting to non-employees are valued on the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment&#13;is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. In prior periods
&#13;the Company accounted for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative&#13;guidance of the FASB whereby the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a)&#13;the date at which a performance commitment is reached

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
&#13;Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for&#13;all leases with terms longer than twelve months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for&#13;leases existing at
 or entered into after

 2018. As a result
 we recorded right-of-use assets aggregating $862
 and lease liabilities of the same amount
 as of that date.&#13;In accordance with ASU 2016-02
 the right-of-use assets are being depreciated over the life of the underlying leases

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13
&#13;Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (&amp;#8220;ASC 326&amp;#8221;). The standard significantly changes&#13;how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets
 including accounts and notes receivables. The standard will&#13;replace today&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;incurred loss&amp;#8221; approach with an &amp;#8220;expected loss&amp;#8221; model
 under which companies will&#13;recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred losses. Entities will apply the standard&amp;#8217;s provisions as a cumulative-effect&#13;adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The standard&#13;is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected&#13;to have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s financial position

 2019 and 2018
 intangible&#13;assets of $576 are comprised of the Virgil&amp;#8217;s brand name. The brand name has been assigned an indefinite life
 as we currently&#13;anticipate that they will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized&#13;but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life remains appropriate.&#13;We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If further testing&#13;is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds&#13;its fair value
 as determined by the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized&#13;in an amount equal to that excess. Based on management&amp;#8217;s measurement
 there were no indications of impairment at December&#13;31


&#13;LLC

 2018
 the Company completed&#13;the sale of the Company&amp;#8217;s Los Angeles manufacturing plant to California Custom Beverage
 LLC
 (&amp;#8220;CCB&amp;#8221;)
 an entity&#13;owned by Chris Reed
 founder
 Chief Innovation Officer and a member of our board of directors of Reed&amp;#8217;s. The sales price&#13;consisted of $1
250 in cash
 and CCB assumed our lease obligation on the California real property
 which aggregated $1
300 at December&#13;31
 2018. The Company recognized a gain of $180 on the sale
 net of transaction costs and other customary adjustments. Our release&#13;from the obligation by the lessor
 however
 is dependent upon CCB&amp;#8217;s deposit of $1
200 of security with the lessor (see Note&#13;14). By the terms of the sale
 CCB was to reimburse the Company for certain costs such as sales tax arising from the transaction&#13;and prepayments. Such costs aggregated $195
 which is reflected as Receivable from Related Party on the accompanying balance sheet&#13;as of December 31
 2018
 and was collected from CCB during the year ended December 31

 we are to receive a 5% royalty&#13;on CCB&amp;#8217;s private label sales to existing customers for three years and a 5% referral fee on CCB&amp;#8217;s private label sales&#13;to referred customers for three years. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company recorded royalty revenue from CCB of $128&#13;which is recorded as a receivable at December 31
 2019. In addition
 at December 31
 2019

 we entered into a three-year co-packing&#13;agreement with CCB
 whereby CCB produces Reed&amp;#8217;s beverages in glass bottles at prevailing West Coast market rates. During&#13;the year ended December 31
 2019
 purchases from CCB under our co-packing agreement amounted to $1
600

 2018
 the Company entered into&#13;a financing agreement with Rosenthal &amp;#38; Rosenthal
 Inc. The financing agreement provides a maximum borrowing capacity of $13
000.&#13;Borrowings are based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable and inventories (the &amp;#8220;permitted borrowings&amp;#8221;) plus&#13;advances (an &amp;#8220;over-advance&amp;#8221;) of up to $4
000 in excess of permitted borrowings. At December 31
 2019
 the unused borrowing&#13;capacity under the financing agreement was $3
235. The line of credit matures on April 20

 plus an additional 2% to 3.5% depending upon whether the borrowing is based upon&#13;receivables
 inventory or is an over-advance. The effective interest rate as of December 31
 2019 on outstanding borrowings was&#13;7.1%. Additionally
 the line of credit is subject to monthly facility and administration fees

 any over-advance is guaranteed by an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit in the&#13;amount of $1
500
 issued by Daniel J. Doherty III and the Daniel J. Doherty
 III 2002 Family Trust
 affiliates of Raptor/Harbor&#13;Reeds SPV LLC (&amp;#8220;Raptor&amp;#8221;). Raptor beneficially owns 14.9% of the Company&amp;#8217;s outstanding common stock as of December&#13;31
 2019. Mr. Doherty is a member of the Company&amp;#8217;s Board of Directors. In the event of a default under the financing agreement
&#13;Raptor has a put option to purchase from Rosenthal the entire amount of any outstanding over-advance plus accrued interest

&#13;the Company amended and restated a subordinated convertible non-redeemable secured note to Raptor
 to provide for additional advances&#13;of up to $4
000 in the event that Raptor exercises its put option described above (see Note 8). Consequently
 the exercise price&#13;of 750
000 of Raptor&amp;#8217;s outstanding warrants to purchase the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock was reduced from $1.50 to $1.10

 including our ability to utilize tangible&#13;and intangible assets as collateral for other indebtedness. Additionally
 the agreement contains a financial covenant that requires&#13;us to meet certain minimum working capital and tangible net worth thresholds as of the end of each quarter. We were in compliance&#13;with the terms of our agreement with Rosenthal as of December 31

 the Company incurred $882 of direct&#13;costs in conjunction with the initial financing agreement
 consisting primarily of broker
 bank and legal fees
 and $161 cost&#13;of warrant modification. The Company annually incurs an additional $130 of fees from the bank
 which is equal to 1% of the $13
000&#13;borrowing limit. These costs have been capitalized and recorded as a debt discount and are being amortized over the 2.5 year life&#13;of the Rosenthal agreement. Amortization of debt discount was $323 for the year ended December 31


 Leases
 effective&#13;October 1
 2018. The standard requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the inception&#13;of the lease
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. As a result
 we recorded right-of-use assets aggregating&#13;$862 as of October 1
 2018
 utilizing a discount rate of 12.60%. That amount consists of new leases on the Company&amp;#8217;s Norwalk&#13;office and certain office equipment of $730

 calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term
 generally on a&#13;straight-line basis. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company reflected accumulated amortization of right of use asset of $211 related&#13;to these leases


 2018
 liabilities&#13;recorded under finance leases and operating leases were $133 and $719
 respectively. During the year ended December 31
 2019
 the&#13;Company made payments of $44 towards finance lease liability and $22 towards operating lease liability. As of December 31
 2019
&#13;the liability under finance lease amounted to $89 and the liability under operating lease amounted to $697

 2019
 the weighted average&#13;remaining lease terms for operating lease and finance lease are 5.01 years and 1.00 years

 2017
 pursuant to a Securities&#13;Purchase Agreement
 the Company issued a secured
 convertible
 subordinated
 non-redeemable note in the principal amount of $3
400&#13;(the &amp;#8220;Raptor Note&amp;#8221;) and warrants to purchase 1
416
667 shares of common stock. The purchaser
 Raptor/Harbor Reeds SPV&#13;LLC (&amp;#8220;Raptor&amp;#8221;)
 beneficially owned approximately 14.9% and 27.1% of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock at December 31
&#13;2019 and 2018

 compounded monthly. It is secured by the Company&amp;#8217;s assets
 subordinate to the first priority security interest&#13;of Rosenthal &amp;#38; Rosenthal (see Note 6). The note may not be prepaid and matures on April 21
 2021. It may be converted
 at any&#13;time and from time to time
 into shares of common stock of the Company

 2022 and&#13;has an adjusted exercise price of $1.50 per share. The note and warrant contain customary anti-dilution provisions

 2018
 in connection with the&#13;execution of the Rosenthal financing agreement
 the Company amended and restated the subordinated convertible non-redeemable secured&#13;note to Raptor
 to provide for additional advances of up to $4
000. In consideration therefore
 the exercise price of 750
000&#13;of Raptor&amp;#8217;s outstanding warrants was reduced from $1.50 to $1.10
 resulting in an increase in the fair value of the warrants
&#13;determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model

 the purchase price of the&#13;underlying stock is received in cash
 except that the plan administrator may permit the exercise price to be paid in any combination&#13;of cash

 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&amp;#8220;ASC 606&amp;#8221;). The underlying principle of ASC 606&#13;is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. ASC 606&#13;creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contract(s)
 which include&#13;(1) identifying the contract or agreement with a customer
 (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement
&#13;(3) determining the transaction price
 (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations

 and contracts with customers contain no incentives or discounts that could&#13;cause revenue to be allocated or adjusted over time. Shipping and handling activities are performed before the customer obtains&#13;control of the goods and therefore represent a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service to the customer. Revenue and&#13;costs of sales are recognized when control of the products transfers to our customer


 except&#13;for damaged products when the damage occurred pre-fulfillment. Damaged product returns have historically been insignificant. Because&#13;of this
 the stand-alone nature of our products
 and our assessment of performance obligations and transaction pricing for our&#13;sales contracts

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13
&#13;Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (&amp;#8220;ASC 326&amp;#8221;). The standard significantly changes&#13;how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets
 including accounts and notes receivables. The standard will&#13;replace today&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;incurred loss&amp;#8221; approach with an &amp;#8220;expected loss&amp;#8221; model
 under which companies will&#13;recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred losses. Entities will apply the standard&amp;#8217;s provisions as a cumulative-effect&#13;adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The standard&#13;is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected&#13;to have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s financial position

 separate
 co-packers for most its production and bottling&#13;of beverage products in the eastern United States. With the December 31
 2018 sale of its manufacturing plant
 the Company no longer&#13;conducts a manufacturing operation
 accordingly it utilizes co-packers to produce 100% of its products as of those dates. The Company&#13;has long-standing relationships with two different co-packers
 and in conjunction with the sale of its manufacturing plant we entered&#13;into a third co-packing agreement with California Custom Beverage LLC (&amp;#8220;CCB&amp;#8221;)
 the purchaser of the plant (see Note&#13;13). CCB is 100% owned by Chris Reed
 founder of the Company and current Chief Information Officer and director. Although there&#13;are other packers
 a change in co-packers may cause a delay in the production process

 2019 and 2018
 the Company&#13;had available Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (&amp;#8220;NOL&amp;#8221;s) to reduce future taxable income. For Federal&#13;purposes the amounts available were approximately $56
000 and $42
000
 respectively. For state purposes approximately $17
000 and&#13;18
000 was available at December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The Federal carryforward expires on various dates through 2035&#13;and the state carryforward expires in 2019. Given the Company&amp;#8217;s history of net operating losses
 management has determined&#13;that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the tax benefit of the carryforwards. Accordingly


&#13;based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position is&#13;measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.&#13;As of December 31

 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the&#13;asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is&#13;recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31

 so classified because we anticipate that these brand names will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually.&#13;Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine&#13;whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. As part of our impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine&#13;whether it is more likely than not the asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value&#13;of our asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined by its discounted cash&#13;flows

 the&#13;Company determined there was no impairment of its indefinite-lived brand names. During our December 31
 2018 impairment testing
&#13;we determined that our Sonoma Sparkler trademark was unlikely to provide future benefit to the Company
 because we do not currently&#13;offer Sonoma Sparkler products and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly
 we reduced the book value&#13;of this asset to zero as of December 31

 whereby the value of the award is measured&#13;on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. Such grants issued&#13;and vesting to non-employees are valued on the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment&#13;is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. In prior periods
&#13;the Company accounted for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative&#13;guidance of the FASB whereby the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a)&#13;the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity&#13;instruments is complete. On January 1

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
&#13;Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for&#13;all leases with terms longer than twelve months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for&#13;leases existing at
 or entered into after

 2018. As a result
 we recorded right-of-use assets aggregating $862
 and lease liabilities of the same amount
 as of&#13;that date. In accordance with ASU 2016-02
 the right-of-use assets are being depreciated over the life of the underlying leases

 the Company completed&#13;the sale of its Los Angeles manufacturing plant to CCB
 an entity owned by Chris Reed
 a related party (See Note 13). The sale&#13;included substantially all machinery
