PART
I

ITEM
1. BUSINESS

COMPANY
OVERVIEW

 Inc. (&ldquo;MOJO&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Jersey City
 NJ. The
Company engages in new product development
 production

 the Company produces Sparkling Coconut Water

CURRENT
OPERATIONS

Sales
and Distribution

The
Company&rsquo;s flagship product is MOJO Pure Coconut Water. In addition to Pure Coconut Water
 the Company produced Sparkling
Coconut Water
 Coconut Water + Mango Juice
 Coconut Water + Pineapple Juice
 and Pure Organic Coconut Water in 2020. We seek to
grow the market share of our products by expanding our hybrid distribution network through the relationships and efforts of our
management and third-party partners an improved broker network
 and new products and packaging in 2021. The company packages its
beverages in 100% recyclable
 Eco-Friendly packaging that can be recycled infinite times and is not made from carbon oil-based
packaging. The packaging has a very low impact on the environment
 and does not contribute to landfills and the pollution of our
bodies of water.



The
Company has multiple sources for its production. The Company&rsquo;s fruit sources are of high quality. The fruit is part of the
overall taste and quality of our products. Currently
 the Company has multiple production facilities that it could source products
from
 each of the facilities could supply our forecasted demand for 2021.



The
beverage industry is competitive. Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition
 ingredient sourcing
 product shelf
space
 and e-commerce page rankings. Our competitors have similar distribution channels and retailers to deliver and sell their
products.

Government
Regulation

Within
the United States
 beverages are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &ldquo;FDA&rdquo;). As such
 it is necessary
for the Company to establish
 maintain and make available for inspection records as well as to develop labels (including nutrition
information) that meet FDA requirements. The Company&rsquo;s production facilities are subject to FDA regulation.



As
of December 31
 2020
 the Company had two employees. The Company also uses the services of contractors
 consultants and other
third-parties. We contract with food brokers to represent our products to specific specialized sales channels. We utilize the
services of direct sales and distribution companies that deliver and sell our products to their customers. We contract with manufacturing
facilities to produce our products and outsource the storage and transportation of our products.

CORPORATE
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

The
Company was incorporated in 2007 and began producing MOJO branded products in 2016. MOJO Organics Inc is headquartered in Jersey
City
 and our internet site is www.MojoOrganicsInc.com. MOJO&rsquo;s stock is traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol MOJO.


    
    


ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS

In
addition to the other information set forth in this report
 you should consider the following factors
 which could materially
affect our business
 financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only
risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business
 financial condition or results of operations in future periods.

If
we are unable to expand our operations in the marketplace
 our growth rate could be negatively affected.

Our
success depends in part on our ability to grow our business. We have adopted and implemented a strategic plan to increase awareness
of our products
 secure additional distribution channels
 and foster and strengthen our supply
 manufacturing and distribution
relationships. Our strategic plan includes addressing changes in the market. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the
growth necessary to achieve our objectives.

We
could need additional capital in the future to expand our operations and execute our business objectives.

Should
we need additional capital to expand our operations
 financing transactions may include the issuance of equity
 debt securities
and credit facilities.

The
challenges of competing with other beverage companies could result in reductions to our revenue and operating margins.

The
nonalcoholic beverage segment of the beverage industry is competitive. We compete with numerous beverage companies
 including
those marketing similar products. All beverages companies are competing for stomach share on a daily basis which is approximately
64 oz. of fluid per day
 per person. Our success depends on our ability to secure distribution channels for our products
 our
ability to make consumers aware of our products and the appeal of our products to consumers.

Disruption
of supply
 increases in costs or shortages of ingredients could affect our operating results.

Availability
of supply and the prices charged by the producers of production inputs used in our products can be affected by a variety of factors
including the general demand by other buyers for the same fruits used by us in our products
 and country politics and country
economics in the area in which our fruit is grown.

The
quality of fruit we seek trades on a negotiated basis
 depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An increase
in the price of any fruit that we use in our products will have a negative effect on our margins should we be unable to increase
our sales price. Higher energy costs may increase the cost of transporting our supplies. Changes in emission rules for maritime
vessels will likely increase costs of shipping our products. Conversely
 lower fruit prices and lower energy prices will have
a positive result on transport and packaging costs.


    
    


We
use independent bottlers for the filling of our products and
 as such
 are subject to the bottler&rsquo;s production and quality
control.

We
use independent bottlers for the production of our products. Accordingly
 we are dependent on the bottlers and their ability to
meet production demands and to achieve product quality. We play an active roll in the production of our beverages
 which includes
but is not limited to developing our formulations
 maintaining control over the labeling and packaging of our beverages
 independent
Underwriters Laboratories testing of our products for safety
 and packaging and function of our packaging and correct FDA labeling.
We also review and monitor the safety certifications of the factories including their status with the United States Food and Drug
Administration. We also inspect the warehouses that our products are stored in
 and monitor the trucking companies that deliver
our goods.

Litigation
and publicity concerning food quality
 health claims
 and other issues could expose us to significant liabilities.

The
packaged food industry can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers and government authorities resulting
from product quality
 health claims
 allergens
 illness
 and injury. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively
affect the Company
 regardless of whether the allegations are true. In addition
 the food industry has been subject to a number
of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell
 and disclosure and advertising practices. Due to the inherent
uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings
 we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable
outcome will have an adverse impact on our business. In addition
 any litigation or regulatory proceedings may result in substantial
costs.

This
report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance. Forward looking statements are often identified by words like: believe
 expect
 estimate
 anticipate
 intend
 project
and similar expressions
 or words which
 by their nature
 refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these
forward-looking statements
 which apply only as of the date of this annual report. These forward-looking statements are subject
to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.

Significant
Accounting Policies

We
have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 which
requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the reporting period. We base these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions
we believe to be reasonable based upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur
 as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included
in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different
assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

All
of our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 to our financial statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We have identified the following as our significant accounting policies and estimates
which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties
 are the most pervasive and important
to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different
results under different assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

We
believe the following significant accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation
of our financial statements:

Use
 &mdash; The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


    
    


Fair
 &mdash; Our short-term financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts
payable and other liabilities
 consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities. We believe that the fair values of
our current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
March 2019
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-01

(Topic 842): Codification Improvements&rdquo;. 
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing essential information about leasing transactions.
The Company has assessed that this pronouncement had no impact on the financial statements.

Results
of Operations

Years
Ended December 31
 2020 and 2019



For
the year ended December 31
 2020
 the Company reported revenue of $1
741
919 a decrease of $1
103 from revenue of $1
743
021 for
the year ended December 31
 2019. The decrease in revenue was due to the COVID-19 pandemic which caused several channels of
our business to be shut down.

Cost
of Revenue

Cost
of revenue includes finished goods purchase costs
 production costs
 raw material costs and freight in costs. Also included in
cost of revenue are adjustments made to inventory carrying amounts
 including markdowns to market.

For
the twelve months ended December 31
 2020
 cost of revenue was $917
639 or 53% of revenue. For the twelve months ended December
31
 2019
 cost of revenue was $908
408 or 52% of revenue. The 1% increase in cost of revenue was due to the packaging costs updates
for old products and also for new products launched in 2020.


    
    


Operating
Expenses

 general and administrative expenses was $910
218 a decrease of $221
594

131
812.

This
decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower compensation expenses coupled with lower marketing and selling
expenses. Compensation expenses decreased by $145
036 compared to the same period last year. Marketing expenses decreased by $15
070
from the same period last year. Selling expenses were $428
110 for the year ended December 31
 2020 compared to $465

 2019.

Working

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure
controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer&rsquo;s management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be
noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
regardless of how remote.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company&rsquo;s senior management
 consisting of the Company&rsquo;s principal
executive and financial officer and the Company&rsquo;s principal accounting officer
 the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the &ldquo;Evaluation Date&rdquo;). Based on this evaluation
the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and financial officer concluded
 as of the Evaluation Date
 that the Company&rsquo;s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
management of MOJO Organics
 Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Therefore
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In
evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this
evaluation
 our officers concluded that
 during the period covered by this annual report
 our internal controls over financial
reporting were not operating effectively.

As
previously reported
 the Company does not have an audit committee and is not currently obligated to have one. Management does
not believe that the lack of an audit committee is a material weakness.

Attestation
Report

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting as such report is not required for non-accelerated filers.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31
 2020 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.

13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Other
than as disclosed below and in this Form 10-K
 there have been no transactions
 since January 1
 2020
 or any currently proposed
transaction
 in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120

 executive officers or
beneficial holders of more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock
 or any of their respective immediate family members
 has had
or will have any direct or material indirect interest.


Director
Independence

We
are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has
requirements that a majority of the board of directors be &ldquo;independent&rdquo; and
 as a result
 we are not at this time
required to (and we do not) have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority of &ldquo;Independent Directors.&rdquo;

Our
Board of Directors has considered the independence of its directors in reference to the definition of &ldquo;independent director&rdquo;
established by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2). In doing so
 the Board of Directors has reviewed all commercial and other
relationships of each director in making its determination as to the independence of its directors. After such review
 the Board
of Directors has determined that Mr. Devlin qualifies as independent under the requirements of the Nasdaq listing standards.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of MOJO Organics
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of MOJO Organics
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31
 2020
 and the
related statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows for the year ended December 31
 2020
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements
present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2020
 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31
 2020
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

Basis
of Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
As part of our audit
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
we express no such opinion.

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical
Audit Matters

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging
 subjective
 or complex judgments. The communication of
critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements
 taken as a whole
 and we are not
 by
communicating the critical audit matters below
 providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or
disclosures to which they relate.

Inventory
Valuation

At
December 31
 2020
 the Company&rsquo;s inventory balance was $174
171. As described in Note 2 to the financial statements
 inventories
consisting solely of finished goods
 are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out method) or net realizable value. If
necessary
 the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventories to net realizable value when the net
realizable value is below cost. At December 31
 2020
 there were no such adjustments to inventory.

Our
audit procedures included testing the reasonableness of management&rsquo;s key assumptions and judgments used to determine the
inventory valuation. For instance
 we confirmed the units held at an independent warehouse
 for selected purchases we vouched the
unit costs to supplier invoices
 we compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales
 and
we reviewed historic inventory turnover.

Stock
Issued for Services

During
the year ended December 31
 2020
 the Company recognized $177
322 in expenses related to stock issued for services. As discussed
in Notes 3 and 4
 the Company has issued stock to Management under an employment agreement and periodically issued other shares
for services. Shares issued for services are recorded at their fair value on their measurement dates based upon prices on OTC
markets.

Our
audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness and accuracy of the accounting and fair value determined by management included
reviewing the agreements and selected documentation supporting the issuances as well as recomputing the valuations made by Management
by examining the prices from third party sources.

MOJO
ORGANICS
 INC.
Notes
to Financial Statements
December
31 2020 and 2019

NOTE
1 &ndash; BUSINESS



MOJO
Organics
 Inc. (&ldquo;MOJO&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a Delaware Corporation headquartered in Jersey City
 NJ. The
Company engages in new product development
 production
 marketing
 distribution and sales of beverage brands that are Non-GMO
Project Verified.

The
Company&rsquo;s flagship product is MOJO Pure Coconut Water. In addition to Pure Coconut Water
 the Company produces Sparkling

its beverages in 100% recyclable
 Eco-Friendly packaging that can be recycled infinite times and is not made from carbon oil-based
packaging. The packaging has a very low impact on the environment
 and does not contribute to landfills and the pollution of our
bodies of water.

NOTE
2 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use
of Estimates

The
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash
equivalents include investment instruments and time deposits purchased with a maturity of three months or less. As of December
31
 2020
 and December 31
 2019
 the Company did not have any cash equivalents.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company provides for probable
uncollectible amounts based upon its assessment of the current status of the individual receivables and after using reasonable
collection efforts. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31
 2020 and 2019 was zero.



Inventories
consisting solely of finished goods
 are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out method) or net realizable value (&ldquo;NRV&rdquo;).
If necessary
 the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventories to NRV when NRV is below cost. There
were no such adjustments in 2020 or 2019.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue
from sales of products is recognized when the related performance obligation is satisfied. The Company&rsquo;s performance obligation
is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to customers. The Company&rsquo;s products are sold on cash and credit
terms which are established in accordance with standardized industry practices and typically require payment within 30 days of
delivery. Costs incurred for sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as reductions in revenue.


    
    


Deductions
from Revenue

Costs
incurred for sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction in revenue. These costs include payments to customers
for performing merchandising activities on our behalf
 including in-store displays
 promotions for new items and obtaining optimum
shelf space.

Shipping
and Handling Costs

Shipping
and Handling Costs incurred to move finished goods from our sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in the
line Selling
 General and Administrative Expenses in our Statements of Operations.

Net
Income/(Loss) Per Common Share

The
Company computes per share amounts in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards
Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 260
ASC Topic 260 requires presentation of basic
and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.

The
following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of weighted average shares outstanding as they
would have had an anti-dilutive impact on the Company&rsquo;s net income/(loss) per common share:



    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
505
608

Income
Taxes



The
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards for federal taxes was $4
637
871 at December 31
 2020 and $5
008
013 for the State of New Jersey.
The Deferred Tax Assets for federal taxes was $973
953 at December 31
 2020 and $451
721 for the State of New Jersey. The total
Deferred Tax Assets was $1
424
674 at December 31
 2020. The Deferred Tax assets have been fully reserved by valuation allowances
beyond that portion which is expected to offset current taxes. As of December 31
 2020
 the Company&rsquo;s Federal income tax
payable would be $12
477 and State Income Tax payable would be $5
347 if this had not been offset by the deferred tax assets.


The
Company provides for income taxes using the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
if
 based on the weight of available evidence
 it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. The Company did not have a deferred tax liability at December 31
 2020 and December 31
 2019.

As
of December 31
 2020
 and December 31
 2019
 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties because there were none.
The Company had no Federal or State tax examinations in the past nor does it have any at the current time.


Fair
value of financial instruments

The
carrying amounts of financial instruments
 which include cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate
their fair values due to their short-term nature.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
December 2019
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12

Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes&rdquo;. 
 evaluate
 and improve areas
of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving
the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The Company is still assessing the impact of this
pronouncement to the financial statements.


    
    


NOTE
3 &ndash; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The
global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused disruptions in supply chains
 affecting production and sales across a range
of industries. While this disruption is currently expected to be temporary
 there is considerable uncertainty around the duration.

The
extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on the effect on our customers and vendors
&ndash; all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this
time.

Employment
Agreements

On
April 6
 2017
 the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Mr. Glenn Simpson (the &ldquo;Simpson
Agreement&rdquo;)
 the Company&rsquo;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the &ldquo;CEO&rdquo;). The Simpson Agreement was
effective April 1
 2017 and has an eight-year term.

Pursuant
to the Simpson Agreement dated April 6
 2017
 Mr. Simpson will be paid a salary of $5
000 per month in cash and the Company
is obligated to grant 67
000 shares of non-trading
 restricted Common Stock per month. Additionally
 Mr. Simpson
is entitled to an annual bonus comprised of cash and non-trading
 restricted Common Stock based on the achievement of performance
goals established by the Board of Directors of the Company and set forth in the Simpson Agreement. The cash bonus is established
at $44
400 per year. The stock bonus is set at 200
000 shares of non-trading
 restricted Common Stock per year through
March 31
 2025 based upon achieving revenue performance goals. The revenue goals range from $900
000 to $19
200
000 per
year. The bonus awards are accelerated when revenues exceed the annual target amounts.

During
the twelve months ended December 31
 2020
 the CEO was issued 804
000 Restricted and Non-Trading shares of Common Stock under
the terms of the Simpson Agreement for the stock portion of his annual compensation. Refer to Note 4 &ndash; Restricted Stock
Issuances.

During
the first quarter of 2020
 Mr. Simpson exercised stock options to purchase 156
250 non-trading
 restricted shares at $0.16 per
share and the total exercise price of $25
000 reduced the accrued salary owed to him. Refer to Note 4 for the explanation of the
conversions. He was paid in cash for the second and fourth quarters
 and for the month of September. Mr. Simpson received 108
696
non-trading
 restricted shares in lieu of cash payments.

The
&ldquo;Simpson Agreement&rdquo; is the only executive employment agreement in effect as of December 31
 2020.

The
Company has no other plans in place and has never maintained any plans that provide for the payment of retirement benefits or
benefits that will be paid primarily following retirement including
 but not limited to
 tax qualified deferred benefit plans
supplemental executive retirement plans
 tax-qualified deferred contribution plans and nonqualified deferred contribution plans.

Lease
Commitment

The
Company maintains office space in Jersey City
 NJ. The initial lease agreement was for the period March 1
 2019 to February 29
2020 and was renewed for one year under the same terms. In April 2020
 the Company was given a 50% discount on the rent for April
and May 2020 as well as an optional lease extension for an additional three months under the same terms. The base rent under this
agreement is $2
343 per month
 and expires May 31
 2021. Lease expense amounted to $25
773 and $27
648 for the year ended December
31
 2020 and 2019 respectively. The security deposit for the lease agreement is $4
518 and the lease expires on May 31
 2021.


    
    


NOTE
4 &ndash; STOCKHOLDERS&rsquo; EQUITY

The
Company has authorized 190
000
000 shares of Common Stock having a par value of $0.001. On February 4
 2019
 the Company
 by a
vote of its majority shareholders
 cancelled the authorization for the issuance of up to 10
000
000 shares of preferred stock.
There were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding prior to this change.

Restricted
Stock Issuances

During
the year ended December 31
 2020
 1
383
946 shares of Restricted and Non-Trading Common Stock were issued to Directors and Officers
of the Company. These shares have full voting rights but are restricted for sale or transfer. The CEO exercised options to purchase
156
250 shares at $0.16 per share for a total exercise price of $25
000 which reduced the accrued salary payable to the CEO by
the same amount.

The
CEO was also issued 804
000 shares of Restricted and Non-Trading Common Stock for the stock portion of his annual salary. A Director
was issued 90
000 shares of non-trading
 restricted Common stock as an award for continuing to serve as a Director of the
Company. The Corporate Controller was also issued 225
000 shares of non-trading
 restricted Common stock for her
annual stock bonus. The value of these shares was recorded as a component of compensation expense.

On
December 8
 2020 the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors signed a unanimous consent to convert Mr. Simpson&rsquo;s accrued salary
payable for the months of July and August amounting $10
000 to 108
696 non-trading
 restricted shares in lieu of cash payments.
This reduced the salary payable to the CEO by the same amount.

6 &ndash; CONCENTRATIONS

Major
Customers


 2020
 the
Company had three customers that accounted for 80% of revenue. The increase in the concentration percentage is due
to the shut down of customers that were affected by the COVID-19 mandated closures. Accounts receivable at December 31
2020 from these three customers amounted to $45
193. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 there were two
major customers accounting for 48% of total revenue.



    
    


Major
Suppliers

During
the year ended December 31
 2020
 the Company purchased its inventory from two suppliers. The Company has established relationships
with other suppliers which management believes could meet its needs on similar terms. Accounts payable at December 31
 2020 to
both suppliers was $20
672.

NOTE
9 &ndash; SBA LOANS &ldquo;CARES ACT&rdquo;

On
May 5
 2020
 the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $35
508 under the Paycheck Protection Program (&ldquo;PPP&rdquo;).
The PPP
 established as part of the Coronavirus Aid
 Relief and Economic Security Act (&ldquo;CARES Act&rdquo;)
 provides for
loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business.
The loans and accrued interest are forgivable after eight weeks as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes
including payroll
 benefits
 rent and utilities
 and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced
if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the eight-week period.

On
May 27
 2020
 the Company received grant proceeds in the amount of $2
000 under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (&ldquo;EIDL&rdquo;)
Program. This grant was recorded as other income during the second quarter of 2020. The EIDL program was created to assist businesses
renters and homeowners located in regions affected by declared disasters. The Company applied for the EIDL Emergency Advance which
provides $1
000 per employee up to a maximum of $10
000.


On
December 18
 2020
 the Company applied for the loan forgiveness for the loan proceeds amounting $35
508 under the Paycheck Protection
Program. The Company believes it has met the criteria for forgiveness and should receive that determination from the US Treasury.

NOTE
10 &ndash; SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The
Company received the loan forgiveness decision from the SBA in January 2021. The full amount of the loan proceeds amounting $35
508
was forgiven.

508 under the Paycheck Protection Program. The Company believes it has met the criteria for forgiveness and should receive that determination from the US Treasury.
