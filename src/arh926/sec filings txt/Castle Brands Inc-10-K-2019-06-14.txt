Our
brands

We
market the premium and super premium brands listed below.

Jefferson&rsquo;s
. We develop and market four premium
 very small batch bourbons: Jefferson&rsquo;s
 Jefferson&rsquo;s
Reserve
 Jefferson&rsquo;s Ocean Aged at Sea and Jefferson&rsquo;s Presidential Select. Each of these four distinct premium Kentucky
bourbons is blended in batches using select barrels of certain mash bills and ages to produce specific flavor profiles. We also

 a premium whiskey distilled from 100% North American rye
 Jefferson&rsquo;s Chef&rsquo;s
Collaboration
 a blend of bourbon and rye
 Jefferson&rsquo;s The Manhattan: Barrel Finished Cocktail
 a ready-to-drink cocktail
Jefferson&rsquo;s Wine Finish Collection
 bourbons aged in wine barrels
 and Jefferson&rsquo;s Wood Experiment
 innovative wood-finished
bourbons.

Goslings
. We are the exclusive global distributor (other than in Bermuda) for Goslings rums
 including Goslings
Black Seal Dark Rum
 Goslings Gold Seal Rum and Goslings Old Rum. The Gosling family produces these rums in Bermuda
 where Goslings
rums have been under continuous production and ownership by the Gosling family for over 200 years. We hold an 80.1% controlling
interest in Gosling-Castle Partners Inc.
 or GCP
 a global export venture between us and the Gosling family. GCP has the exclusive
long-term export and distribution rights for the Goslings rum products for all countries other than Bermuda. The Goslings rum
brands accounted for approximately 20% and 21% of our revenues for our 2019 and 2018 fiscal years
 respectively. We also are the
exclusive global distributor (other than in Bermuda and various regional markets) of Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer
 an essential
 rum cocktail and the Goslings Dark &lsquo;n
Stormy 

Knappogue
. We developed our Knappogue Castle Whiskey
 a single malt Irish whiskey
 to build on both the popularity
of single malt Scotch whisky and the growth in the Irish whiskey category. Knappogue Castle Whiskey is distilled in pot stills
using malted barley and is aged twelve years. We have introduced Knappogue Twin Wood
 the first Sherry Finished Knappogue Castle
Whiskey. The whiskey is matured for sixteen years in two types of wood resulting in a perfectly balanced single malt Irish whiskey
with a complex
 rich taste and a slightly sweet sherry finish. Knappogue Castle 1951 is a pure pot-still whiskey that was distilled
in 1951 and then aged for 36 years in sherry casks. The name comes from an Irish castle
 formerly owned by Mark Edwin Andrews
the originator of the brand and the father of Mark Andrews
 our chairman.

Clontarf
. Our family of Clontarf Irish whiskeys currently represents a majority of our case sales of Irish whiskey.
Clontarf
 an accessible and smooth premium Irish whiskey
 is distilled using quality grains and pure Irish spring water. Clontarf
is then aged in bourbon barrels and mellowed through Irish oak charcoal. Clontarf is available in single malt and classic versions.


    
    


Brady&rsquo;s
. Brady&rsquo;s Irish Cream
 a high-quality Irish cream
 is made in small batches using Irish whiskey
dairy fresh cream and natural flavors.

Boru
. Boru vodka
 a premium vodka produced in Ireland
 was developed in 1998 and is named after the legendary High King
of Ireland
 Brian Boru
 who united the Irish clans and drove foreign invaders out of Ireland. It is five-times distilled using
pure spring water for smoothness and filtered through ten feet of charcoal made from Irish oak for increased purity.

Celtic
. Celtic Honey is a premium brand of Irish liqueur that is a unique combination of Irish spirits
 cognac
and a taste of honey. Gaelic Heritage Corporation Limited
 an affiliate of one of our bottlers
 has the exclusive rights to produce
and supply us with Celtic Honey.

Pallini
. We have the exclusive U.S. distribution rights (excluding duty free sales) for Pallini Limoncello and its related
brand extensions. Pallini Limoncello is a premium lemon liqueur
 which is served ice cold
 on the rocks or as an ingredient in
a wide variety of drinks
 ranging from martinis to iced tea. It is also used in cooking
 particularly for pastries and cakes.
Pallini Limoncello is crafted from an authentic family recipe. It is made with Italy&rsquo;s finest Sfusato Amalfitano lemons
that are hand-selected for optimal freshness and flavor. There are two other flavor extensions of this Italian liqueur: Pallini
Peachcello
 made with white peaches
 and Pallini Raspicello
 made from a combination of raspberries and other berries.

Gozio
. We are the exclusive U.S. distributor for Gozio amaretto
 which is made from a secret recipe that combines selected
fruits from four continents.

Arran
 In 2017
 we became the exclusive U.S. distributor for the Arran Scotch whiskeys. Arran Scotch whiskeys
are produced by Isle of Arran Distillers
 an independent distiller of premium quality Single Malt Scotch whiskeys. Located in
the village of Lochranza on the Isle of Arran
 the distillery opened in 1995 and is the only whisky producer on the island. The
Arran portfolio includes the classic 10 Years Old
 the new 18 Years Old
 as well as the official Robert Burns whiskeys
endorsed by the World Burns Federation
 and the limited edition Machrie Moor Scotch Whiskeys.

Our
strategy

Our
objective is to continue building Castle Brands into a profitable international spirits company
 with a distinctive portfolio
of premium and super premium spirits brands. To achieve this
 we continue to seek to:



    
focus
 We continue to focus our distribution efforts
 sales expertise and targeted
    marketing activities on our more profitable brands and markets;

    
grow
 We believe that continued organic growth will enable us to achieve long-term profitability. We focus
    on brands that have profitable growth potential and staying power
 such as our rums
 whiskeys and ginger beer
 sales of which
    have grown substantially in recent years;

    
focus on innovation.
We continue to innovate in our portfolio
    by developing new brand extensions
 expressions
 blends and processes
 such as our Ocean Aged at Sea bourbons and our wine-finishes
    for our bourbons and Irish whiskeys. We believe that continued focus on innovation will drive sales growth
 build brand loyalty
    and open new markets;

    
leverage
 Our established distribution network in all 50 U.S. states enables us to promote our brands
    nationally and makes us an attractive strategic partner for smaller companies seeking U.S. distribution;

    
selectively
 We continue to explore strategic relationships
 joint ventures and acquisitions
    to selectively expand our premium spirits portfolio. For example
 we added the Arran Scotch whiskeys to our portfolio as agency
    brands. We expect that future acquisitions or agency relations
 if any
 would involve some combination of cash
 debt and the
    issuance of our stock; and

    
build consumer awareness.
We use our existing assets
 expertise and
    resources to build consumer awareness and market penetration for our brands.


Production
and supply

There
are several steps in the production and supply process for beverage alcohol products
 whether we produce certain products through
third-party suppliers or purchase certain products directly from brand owners. First
 all of our spirits products are distilled.
This is a multi-stage process that converts basic ingredients
 such as grain or sugar cane
 into alcohol. Next
 the alcohol is
processed and/or aged in various ways depending on the requirements of the specific brand. For our vodka
 this processing is designed
to remove all other chemicals
 so that the resulting liquid will be odorless and colorless and have a smooth quality with minimal
harshness. Achieving a high level of purity involves a series of distillations and filtration processes.


    
    


For
our spirits brands
 rather than removing flavor
 various complex flavor profiles are achieved through one or more of the following
techniques: infusion of fruit
 addition of various flavoring substances
 and
 in the case of rums and whiskeys
 aging of the brands
in various types of casks for extended periods of time and the blending of several rums or whiskeys to achieve a unique flavor
profile for each brand. After the distillation
 purification and flavoring processes are completed
 the various liquids are bottled.
This involves several important stages
 including bottle and label design and procurement
 filling of the bottles and packaging
of the bottles in various configurations for shipment.

We
do not have significant investments in distillation
 bottling or other production facilities or equipment. Instead
 we have entered
into relationships with several companies to provide those services to us. We believe that these types of arrangements allow us
to avoid committing significant amounts of capital to fixed assets and permit us to have the flexibility to meet growing sales
levels by dealing with companies whose capacity significantly exceeds our current needs. These relationships vary on a brand-by-brand
basis as discussed below. As part of our ongoing cost-containment efforts
 we intend to continue to review each of our business
relationships to determine if we can increase the efficiency of our operations.

Jefferson&rsquo;s
whiskeys

Our
Jefferson&rsquo;s whiskey portfolio is bottled for us by Luxco
 Inc. (&ldquo;Luxco&rdquo;)
 in Cleveland
 OH
 from our stocks
of aged bourbon and rye. Bourbon has been in short supply in the U.S. in recent years
 and we continue to actively seek alternate
sourcing for future supply. We have acquired stocks of aged bourbon
 which we anticipate will supply our currently forecasted
needs for the Jefferson&rsquo;s brand
 although there is no assurance we can source adequate amounts of bourbon or rye
 if demand
is greater than expected
 at satisfactory prices.


    
    


We
are parties to a supply agreement with a bourbon distiller
 which provides for the production of newly distilled bourbon whiskey
through June 30
 2026. Under this agreement
 the distiller provides us with an agreed upon amount of original proof gallons of
newly distilled bourbon whiskey
 subject to certain annual adjustments. We are not obligated to pay the distiller for any product
not yet received. Also
 if the distiller has excess inventory in any year
 we have the right
 but not the obligation
 to purchase
such excess.

We
have entered into another supply agreement with a bourbon distiller
 which provides for the production of newly distilled bourbon
whiskey through December 31
 2019
 subject to automatic annual renewals. Under this agreement
 the distiller provides us with
an agreed upon amount of original proof gallons of newly distilled bourbon whiskey
 subject to certain annual adjustments. We
are not obligated to pay the distiller for any product not yet received.

Goslings
rum and ginger beer

Goslings
rums have been produced by the Gosling family in Hamilton
 Bermuda for over 200 years and
 under our distribution arrangements
with Gosling&rsquo;s Export (Bermuda) Limited (&ldquo;Gosling&rsquo;s Export&rdquo;)
 they have retained the right to act as the
sole supplier to GCP with respect to our Goslings rum requirements. Goslings sources its rums in the Caribbean and transports
them to Bermuda where they are blended according to proprietary recipes. The rums are then sent to a plant
 owned and operated
by a third party
 in the United States
 where they are bottled
 packaged
 stored and shipped to our third-party warehouse. We
believe that Gosling&rsquo;s Export&rsquo;s blending and storage facilities in Bermuda will accommodate our projected supply needs
for the foreseeable future. We believe our third-party U.S. bottler has ample capacity to meet our projected bottling needs for
the foreseeable future. See &ldquo;Strategic brand-partner relationships.&rdquo;

Our
Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer is produced
 canned and/or bottled by third-party soft-drink bottlers and canners to Goslings&rsquo;
formula and requirements. We believe these bottlers and canners have ample capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the
foreseeable future.

Knappogue
Castle and Clontarf Irish whiskeys

In
2012
 we entered into two long-term supply agreements with Irish Distillers Limited (&ldquo;IDL&rdquo;)
 a subsidiary of Pernod
Ricard
 under which it has agreed to supply us with the aged single malt and grain whiskeys used in our Knappogue Castle whiskey
products and all of our Clontarf Irish whiskey products. The first supply agreement provides for the production of blended Irish
whiskeys for us until the contract is terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the agreement. IDL may terminate
the contract if it provides at least six years prior notice
 except for breach. Under this agreement
 we provide IDL with a forecast
of the estimated amount of liters of pure alcohol we require for the next four fiscal contract years and agree to purchase that
amount
 subject to certain annual adjustments. The second supply agreement provides for the production of single malt Irish whiskeys
for us until the contract is terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the agreement. IDL may terminate the contract
if it provides at least thirteen years prior notice
 except for breach. Under this agreement
 we provide IDL with a forecast of
the estimated amount of liters of pure alcohol we require for the next twelve fiscal contract years and agree to purchase that
amount
 subject to certain annual adjustments. We are not obligated to pay for any product not yet received. The whiskeys are
then sent to Terra Limited (&ldquo;Terra&rdquo;) in Baileyboro
 Ireland
 where they are bottled in bottles we designed and packaged
for shipment. We believe that Terra
 which also acts as bottler for certain of our Boru vodka and as producer and bottler of our
Brady&rsquo;s Irish Cream (and as bottler for Celtic Honey
 which is supplied to us by one of Terra&rsquo;s affiliates)
 has sufficient
bottling capacity to meet our current needs
 and both Terra and IDL have the capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the
foreseeable future.

Terra
provides intake
 storage
 sampling
 testing
 filtering
 filling
 capping and labeling of bottles
 case packing
 warehousing and
loading and inventory control for our Knappogue Castle and Clontarf Irish whiskeys at prices that are adjusted annually by mutual
agreement based on changes in raw materials and consumer price indexes increases up to 3.5% per annum. This agreement also provides
for maintenance of product specifications and minimum processing procedures
 including compliance with applicable food and alcohol
regulations and maintenance
 storage and stock control of all raw products and finished products delivered to Terra. Terra holds
all alcohol on its premises under its customs and excise bond. Our bottling and services agreement with Terra will expire on June
30
 2019. We expect to continue to operate under the terms of the expiring contract as we negotiate a new agreement with Terra.
We believe we could obtain alternative sources of bottling and services if we are unable to renew the existing Terra contract.

Boru
vodka

We
have a supply agreement with a leading European producer of grain neutral spirits to provide us with the distilled alcohol used
in our Boru vodka. The supply agreement provides for the producer to produce natural spirit for us with specified levels of alcohol
content pursuant to specifications set forth in the agreement and at specified prices through its expiration in December 2019
in quantities designated by us. We believe that the producer has sufficient distilling capacity to meet our needs for Boru vodka
for the foreseeable future. If we do not renew the production agreement
 we believe that we will be able to obtain grain neutral
spirits from another supplier.

The
five-times distilled alcohol is delivered from the producer to the bottling premises at Terra
 where it is filtered in several
proprietary ways
 and pure water is added to achieve the desired proof. Depending on the size of the bottle
 Boru vodka is then
either bottled at Terra or shipped in bulk to the U.S. and bottled at Luxco
 where we bottle certain sizes for the U.S. market.
We believe that both Terra and Luxco have sufficient bottling capacity to meet our current needs
 and both have the capacity to
meet our anticipated future supply needs. As described above
 our bottling and services agreement with Terra will expire on June
30
 2019. We expect to continue to operate under the terms of the expiring contract as we negotiate a new agreement with Terra.
We believe we could obtain alternative sources of bottling and services if we are unable to renew the existing Terra contract.

Brady&rsquo;s
Irish Cream

Brady&rsquo;s
Irish Cream is produced for us by Terra. Fresh cream is combined with Irish whiskey
 grain neutral spirits and various flavorings
to our specifications
 and then bottled by Terra in bottles designed for us. We believe that Terra has the capacity to meet our
foreseeable supply needs for this brand. As described above
 our bottling and services agreement with Terra will expire on June
30
 2019. We expect to continue to operate under the terms of the expiring contract as we negotiate a new agreement with Terra.
We believe we could obtain alternative sources of bottling and services if we are unable to renew the existing Terra contract.

Celtic
Honey liqueur

Gaelic
Heritage Corporation Limited
 an affiliate of Terra
 has a contractual right to act as the sole supplier to us of Celtic Honey.
Gaelic Heritage mixes the ingredients comprising Celtic Honey using a proprietary formula and then Terra bottles it for them in
bottles designed for us. We believe that the necessary ingredients are available to Gaelic Heritage in sufficient supply and that
Terra&rsquo;s bottling capacity is currently adequate to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future. See &ldquo;Strategic
brand-partner relationships.&rdquo;

Pallini
liqueurs

Pallini
SpA (&ldquo;Pallini&rdquo;)
 as successor in interest to I.L.A.R. S.p.A.
 an Italian company based in Rome and owned since 1875
by the Pallini family
 produces Pallini Limoncello
 Raspicello and Peachcello. Pallini bottles the liqueurs at its plant in Rome
and ships them to us under our long-term exclusive U.S. marketing and distribution agreement. We believe that Pallini has adequate
facilities to produce and bottle sufficient Limoncello
 Peachcello and Raspicello to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable
future. See &ldquo;Strategic brand-partner relationships.&rdquo;

Gozio
amaretto

We
are the exclusive U.S. distributor for Gozio amaretto. Gozio amaretto is produced by Distillerie Franciacorta
 a spirits company
founded in 1901 and owned by the Gozio family. The company is located in Franciacorta
 in the Italian Region of Lombardy. We believe
that Distillerie Franciacorta has sufficient capacity to meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future for this brand.


    
    


Arran
Scotch Whiskeys

We
are the exclusive U.S. distributor for the Isle of Arran premium whisky portfolio
 produced by the Isle of Arran Distillers. The
Isle of Arran Distillers is an independent distiller of premium quality Single Malt Scotch whiskeys. Located in the village of
Lochranza on the Isle of Arran
 the distillery opened in 1995 and is the only whisky producer on the island. The Arran&rsquo;s
portfolio includes the classic 10 Years Old
 the new 18 Years Old as well as the official Robert Burns whiskeys
 endorsed by the
World Burns Federation
 and the Machrie Moor whiskeys. We believe that the Isle of Arran Distillers has sufficient capacity to
meet our projected supply needs for the foreseeable future for these brands.

Distribution
network

We
believe that the distribution network that we have developed with our sales team and our independent distributors and brokers
is one of our strengths. We currently have distribution and brokerage relationships with third-party distributors in all 50 U.S.
states
 as well as distribution arrangements in approximately 20 other countries.

U.S.
distribution

Background.
Importers of beverage alcohol in the U.S. must sell their products through a three-tier distribution system. Typically
an imported brand is first sold to a U.S. importer
 who then sells it to a network of distributors
 or wholesalers
 covering the
U.S.
 in either &ldquo;open&rdquo; states or &ldquo;control&rdquo; states. In the 33 open states
 the distributors are generally
large
 privately-held companies. In the 17 control states
 the states themselves function as the distributor
 and regulate suppliers
such as us. The distributors and wholesalers in turn sell to individual retailers
 such as liquor stores
 restaurants
 bars
 supermarkets
and other outlets licensed to sell beverage alcohol. In larger states such as New York
 more than one distributor may handle a
brand in separate geographical areas. In control states
 importers sell their products directly to state liquor authorities
 which
distribute the products and either operate retail outlets or license the retail sales function to private companies
 while maintaining
strict control over pricing and profit.

The
U.S. spirits industry has consolidated dramatically over the last ten years due to merger and acquisition activity. There are
currently at least twelve major spirits companies
 each of which own and operate their own importing businesses. All companies
including these large companies
 are required by law to sell their products through wholesale distributors in the U.S. The major
companies are exerting increasing influence over the regional distributors and as a result
 it has become more difficult for smaller
companies to get their products recognized by the distributors. We believe our established distribution network in all 50 states
allows us to overcome a significant barrier to entry in the U.S. beverage alcohol market and enhances our attractiveness as a
strategic partner for smaller companies lacking comparable distribution.

For
fiscal 2019
 our U.S. sales represented approximately 91% of our revenues
 and we expect them to remain relatively consistent
as a percentage of our total sales in the near future. See note 16 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Importation.
We currently hold the federal importer and wholesaler license required by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau
of the U.S. Treasury Department
 and the requisite state license in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Our
inventory is strategically maintained in large bonded warehouses and shipped nationally by an extensive network of licensed and
bonded carriers.

Wholesalers
 In the U.S.
 we are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or
 in the control states
 state-owned
agencies performing this function
 to sell our brands to retail outlets. As a result
 we depend on distributors for sales
 for
product placement and for retail store penetration. We currently have no distribution agreements or minimum sales requirements
with any of our U.S. alcohol distributors
 and they are under no obligation to place our products or market our brands. All of
the distributors also distribute our competitors&rsquo; products and brands. As a result
 we must foster and maintain our relationships
with our distributors. Through our internal sales team
 we have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors
in each state
 and our products are currently sold in the U.S. by approximately 80 wholesale distributors
 as well as by various
state beverage alcohol control agencies.

International
distribution

In
our foreign markets
 most countries permit sales directly from the brand owner to retail establishments
 including liquor stores
chain stores
 restaurants and pubs
 without requiring that sales go through a wholesaler tier. In our international markets
 we
rely primarily on established spirits distributors in much the same way as we do in the U.S. We have engaged an international
beverage alcohol broker to represent our brands in approximately twenty international markets. We use Terra and other bonded warehouses
and logistic providers to handle the billing
 inventory and shipping for us for some products in certain of our non-U.S. markets.

As
in the U.S.
 the beverage alcohol industry has undergone consolidation internationally
 with considerable realignment of brands
and brand ownership. The number of major spirits companies internationally has been reduced significantly due to mergers and brand
ownership consolidation. While there are still a substantial number of companies owning one or more brands
 most business is now
done by the thirteen major companies
 each of which owns and operates its own distribution company that distributes in
the major international markets. These captive distribution companies focus primarily on the brands of the companies that own
them.


    
    


Even
though we do not utilize the direct route to market in our international operations
 we do not believe that we are at a significant
disadvantage
 because the local importers/distributors typically have established relationships with the retail accounts and are
able to provide extensive customer service
 in store merchandising and on-premise promotions. Also
 even though we must compensate
our wholesalers and distributors in each market in which we sell our brands
 we are
 as a result of using these distributors
still able to benefit from substantially lower infrastructure costs and centralized billing and collection.

Our
primary international markets are Ireland
 Great Britain
 Northern Ireland
 Germany
 Canada
 France
 Finland
 Norway
 Sweden
Holland and the Duty-Free markets. We also have sales in other countries in continental Europe
 Latin America
 the Caribbean and
Asia. For fiscal 2019
 non-U.S. sales represented approximately 9% of our revenues. See note 16 to our accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

Significant
customers



Southern Glazer&rsquo;s Wine and Spirits and related entities
 accounted for approximately 36% and 37% of our consolidated
revenues for fiscal 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Our
sales team

While
we currently expect more rapid growth in the U.S.
 our primary market
 international markets hold potential for future growth
and are part of our global strategy.

We
currently have a total sales force of 24 people
 including five regional U.S. vice presidents who have significant industry experience
with premium beverage alcohol brands.

Our
sales personnel are engaged in the day-to-day management of our distributors
 which includes setting quotas
 coordinating promotional
plans for our brands
 maintaining adequate levels of stock
 brand education and training and sales calls with distributor personnel.
Our sales team also maintains relationships with key retail customers through independent sales calls. They also schedule promotional
events
 create local brand promotion plans
 host in-store tastings where permitted and provide wait staff and bartender training
and education for our brands.

Advertising
marketing and promotion

To
build our brands
 we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: our distributors
 the retail trade and the end
consumer. Advertising
 marketing and promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image of our brands in our efforts
to build substantial brand value. We believe our execution of disciplined and strategic branding and marketing campaigns will
continue to drive our future sales.

We
employ full-time
 in-house marketing
 sales and customer service personnel who work together with third party design and advertising
firms to maintain a high degree of focus on each of our product categories and build brand awareness through innovative marketing
activities. We use a range of marketing strategies and tactics to build brand equity and increase sales
 including consumer and
trade advertising
 price promotions
 point-of-sale materials
 event sponsorship
 in-store and on-premise promotions and public
relations
 as well as a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques
 including social media marketing
to support our brands.

Besides
traditional advertising
 we also employ three other marketing methods to support our brands: public relations
 event sponsorships
and tastings. Our significant U.S. public relations efforts have helped gain editorial coverage for our brands
 which increases
brand awareness. Event sponsorship is an economical way for us to have influential consumers taste our brands. We actively contribute
product to trend-setting events where our brand has exclusivity in the brand category. We also conduct hundreds of in-store and
on-premise promotions each year.

We
support our brand marketing efforts with an assortment of point-of-sale materials. The combination of trade and consumer programs
supported by attractive point-of-sale materials
 also establishes greater credibility for us with our distributors and retailers.

Strategic
brand-partner relationships

We
forge strategic relationships with emerging and established spirits brand owners seeking opportunities to increase their sales
beyond their home markets and achieve global growth. This ability is a key component of our growth strategy and one of our competitive
strengths. Our original relationship with the Boru vodka brand was as its exclusive U.S. distributor. To date
 we have also established
strategic relationships for Goslings rums
 Pallini liqueurs
 Celtic Honey liqueur
 the Arran Scotch Whiskeys
 and Gozio amaretto
as described below
 and we intend to seek to expand our brand portfolio through similar future arrangements.


    
    


Gosling-Castle
Partners Inc./Goslings rums and ginger beer

In
2005
 we entered into an exclusive national distribution agreement with Gosling&rsquo;s Export for the Goslings rum products.
We subsequently purchased a 60% controlling interest in GCP
 a strategic export venture with the Gosling family. In March 2017
we purchased an additional 20.1% interest in GCP
 which we refer to as the GCP Share Acquisition
 and
 accordingly
 we now own
80.1% of GCP. Pursuant to an export agreement entered into between Gosling&rsquo;s Export and GCP
 Gosling&rsquo;s Export assigned
to GCP all of Gosling&rsquo;s Export&rsquo;s interest in our distribution agreement with them. GCP holds the exclusive distribution
rights for Goslings rum products and Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer on a worldwide basis (other than in Bermuda). The export agreement
expires in April 2030
 with ten-year renewal terms thereafter
 subject to specific termination rights held by each party. Under
the export agreement
 in the event Gosling&rsquo;s Export decides to sell any or all of its trademarks (or other intellectual
property rights) relating to the Goslings&rsquo; products (other than Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer) during the term of the export
agreement
 GCP has a right of first refusal to purchase said trademark(s) (and intellectual property rights
 if applicable) at
the same price being offered by a bona fide third-party offerer. If GCP does not exercise its right of first refusal
 then we
have an identical right of first refusal. In the event Gosling&rsquo;s Export decides to sell any or all of its products (other
than Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer) and/or trademark(s) (other than Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer)
 whether sold to an affiliate
a third party
 GCP or us
 GCP is entitled to share in the proceeds of such sale
 according to a schedule specified in the export
agreement. Also
 in the event Gosling&rsquo;s Export should decide to sell Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer or trademarks relating
to Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer
 whether sold to an affiliate
 a third party
 GCP or us
 then
 Gosling&rsquo;s Export agrees to
share with GCP an amount equal to a certain percentage of the proceeds of any such sale as specified in the export agreement.
The Goslings
 through Gosling Brothers Limited
 have the right to act as the sole supplier to GCP for our Goslings rum requirements.
Polar Corp.
 the exclusive U.S. manufacturer of the ginger beer
 is authorized to purchase product from GCP to sell directly on
a non-exclusive basis to its existing customers that are grocery supermarket chains
 drug store chains or convenience store chains
located in New England and New York through direct store delivery or approved wholesalers
 and on a limited basis to sell to liquor
stores in New England that are its existing clients.

Pallini
SpA/Pallini liqueurs

We
have an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement with Pallini under which we distribute Pallini Limoncello
 Peachcello and
Raspicello liqueurs in the U.S. We began shipping these products in September 2005.

Our
agreement with Pallini expires on March 31
 2021
 subject to successive five-year renewals unless either party delivers a notice
of non-renewal six months prior to the end of the term. Under the agreement
 if minimum shipment targets are not achieved and
not cured
 Pallini has the right to terminate the agreement without payment of termination fees to us. However
 if such targets
are met
 we have the right under the agreement to receive certain termination payments and other payments upon the non-renewal
of the agreement
 certain terminations of the agreement or the sale of the brand. The exclusive territory under the agreement
is the 50 states of the U.S. and the District of Columbia.

Gozio
amaretto

In
November 2011
 we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Distillerie Franciacorta S.p.A. under which we are the
exclusive distributor of Gozio amaretto in the U.S. The agreement had an initial five-year term
 and has automatic five-year renewals
unless either party delivers a notice of non-renewal six months prior to the end of the term. During the term
 we have the right
to purchase Gozio amaretto at stipulated prices and Distillerie Franciacorta Spa must maintain certain standards for its products.
We are required to prepare periodic reports detailing the development of the brand&rsquo;s sales and prepare annual strategic
marketing and growth plans.

Arran
Scotch Whiskeys

In
February 2017
 we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with the Isle of Arran Distillers under which we are the exclusive
distributors for The Arran Malt Single Malt Scotch Whiskeys
 the Robert Burns Single Malt Scotch Whisky and Blended Scotch Whisky
and the Machrie Moor whiskeys in the U.S. market. The agreement has an initial term expiring on March 31
 2022
 and has automatic
five-year renewals upon our achieving certain minimum purchase requirements. During the term
 we have the right to purchase Isle
of Arran
 Robert Burns and Machrie Moor products at stipulated prices and Isle of Arran must maintain certain standards for its
products. We are required to prepare periodic reports detailing the development of the brand&rsquo;s sales and prepare annual
strategic marketing and growth plans.

Intellectual
property

Trademarks
are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks
 which we own or use under license.
Our brands are protected by trademark registrations or are the subject of pending applications for trademark registration in the
U.S.
 the European Union and most other countries where we distribute
 or plan to distribute
 our brands. The trademarks may be
registered in the names of our subsidiaries and related companies. Generally
 the term of a trademark registration varies from
country to country
 and
 in the U.S.
 trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks
in additional markets as we expand our distribution territories.

We
have entered into distribution agreements for brands owned by third parties
 such as the Goslings rums
 the Pallini liqueurs
Isle of Arran whiskeys and Gozio amaretto. The Goslings brands
 Pallini liqueurs
 Isle of Arran and Robert Burns Scotch whiskeys
and Gozio amaretto are registered by their respective owners. Goslings also has a trademark for their signature rum cocktail
Dark &lsquo;n Stormy. See &ldquo;Strategic brand-partner relationships.&rdquo;


    
    




The
beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We believe that we compete on the basis of quality
 price
 brand recognition
and distribution strength. Our premium brands compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases
retail shelf space
 restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors
of beverage alcohol products
 many of which have greater resources than us.

Over
the past ten years
 the U.S. spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership.
The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today there are at least thirteen major companies:
Diageo PLC
 Pernod Ricard S.A.
 Bacardi Limited
 Brown-Forman Corporation
 Beam Suntory Inc.
 Davide Campari Milano-S.p.A.
 Remy
Cointreau S.A.
 LVMH Mo&euml;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A
 Constellation Brands
 Inc.
 Proximo Spirits
 Sazerac Company
 Inc.
Heaven Hill Brands and William Grant &amp; Sons Distillers
 Ltd.

We
believe that we are sometimes in a better position to partner with small to mid-size brands than the major importers. Despite
our relative capital position and resources
 we have been able to compete with these larger companies in pursuing agency distribution
agreements and acquiring brands by being more responsive to private and family-owned brands
 offering flexible transaction structures
and providing brand owners the option to retain local production and &ldquo;home&rdquo; market sales. Given our size relative
to our major competitors
 most of which have multi-billion dollar operations
 we believe that we can provide greater focus on
smaller brands and tailor transaction structures based on individual brand owner preferences. However
 our relative capital position
and resources may limit our marketing capabilities
 limit our ability to expand into new markets and limit our negotiating ability
with our distributors.

By
focusing on the premium and super-premium segments of the market
 which typically have higher margins
 and having an established
experienced sales force
 we believe we are able to gain relatively significant attention from our distributors for a company of
our size. Our U.S. regional vice presidents provide long-standing relationships with distributor personnel and with their major
customers. Finally
 the continued consolidation among the major companies is expected to create an opportunity for small to mid-size
wine and spirits companies
 such as ourselves
 as the major companies contract their portfolios to focus on fewer brands.

Government
regulation

We
are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act
 U.S. Customs Laws
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 and
the Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws of all fifty states.

The
U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production
 blending
 bottling
 sales
and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also
 each state regulates the advertising
 promotion
 transportation
sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the U.S. only with
holders of licenses to import
 warehouse
 transport
 distribute and sell spirits.

In
Europe
 we are subject to similar regulations related to the production of spirits.

We
are subject to U.S. and European regulations on the advertising
 marketing and sale of beverage alcohol. These regulations range
from a complete prohibition of the marketing of alcohol in some countries to restrictions on the advertising style
 media and
messages used.

Labeling
of spirits is also regulated in many markets
 varying from health warning labels to importer identification
 alcohol strength
and other consumer information. All beverage alcohol products sold in the U.S. must include warning statements related to risks
of drinking beverage alcohol products.

We
are also subject to certain regulatory requirements regarding minimum aging of spirits.

In
the U.S. control states
 the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased
and offered for sale in their respective states. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which
are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Consumers may purchase products
not selected for listings only through special orders
 if at all.

The
distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation in the U.S. and internationally.
Most foreign countries in which we do business impose excise duties on distilled spirits
 although the form of such taxation varies
from a simple application on units of alcohol by volume to intricate systems based on the imported or wholesale value of the product.
Several countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits
 often discriminating between categories in the rate of such
tariffs. Import and excise duties may have a significant effect on our sales
 both through reducing the consumption of alcohol
and through encouraging consumer switching into lower-taxed categories of alcohol.


    
    


We
believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal
 state and other regulations. However
 we operate in a highly
regulated industry which may be subject to more stringent interpretations of existing regulations. Future compliance costs due
to regulatory changes could be significant.

Since
we import distilled spirits products produced primarily outside the U.S.
 adverse effects of regulatory changes are more likely
to materially affect earnings and our competitive market position rather than capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in our
industry are normally associated with either production facilities or brand acquisition costs. Because we are not a U.S. producer
changes in regulations affecting production facility operations may indirectly affect the costs of the brands we purchase for
resale
 but we would not anticipate any resulting material adverse impact upon our capital expenditures.

Global
conglomerates with international brands dominate our industry. The adoption of more restrictive marketing and sales regulations
or increased excise taxes and customs duties could materially adversely affect our earnings and competitive industry position.
Large international conglomerates have greater financial resources than we do and would be better able to absorb increased compliance
costs.



As
of March 31
 2019
 we had 59 employees
 36 of which were in sales and marketing and 23 of which were in management
 finance and
administration. As of March 31
 2019
 53 of our employees were located in the U.S. and six were located in Ireland.

Item
1A. Risk Factors

Risks
Relating To Our Business


We
have incurred
 and may again incur
 losses.

We
have incurred losses since our inception
 with the exception of net income attributable to common shareholders of $5.7 million
for fiscal 2019
 and had an accumulated loss of $144.2 million as of March 31
 2019. We may continue to incur consolidated
net losses as we expect to make continued significant investment in product development and sales and marketing and to incur significant
administrative expenses as we seek to grow our brands. Our cash needs may exceed our income from sales for the near
future. Some of our products may never achieve widespread market acceptance and may not generate sales and profits to justify
our investment. Also
 we may find that our expansion plans are more costly than we anticipate and that they do not ultimately
result in commensurate increases in our sales
 which would increase our losses. We cannot assure you that we will maintain profitability
or have positive cash flows on either a quarterly or annual basis. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors
some of which are beyond our control
 including market acceptance of our products
 new product introductions and competition.
We incur substantial operating expenses at the corporate level
 including costs directly related to being an SEC reporting company.


    
    


We
have a significant amount of debt outstanding
 which may have a material adverse effect on our business.

As
of March 31
 2019
 our total debt was approximately $47.1 million. In the future
 we may continue to incur additional indebtedness
for working capital purposes or to fund potential acquisitions of new brands. Our current and future indebtedness and covenants
contained in agreements governing such indebtedness may:



    
require
    us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to the payment of debt service
 resulting in less cash
    available for operations and other purposes;

    
    

    
limit
    our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms
 or at all;

    
    

    
increase
    our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in general economic conditions; and

    
    

    
impact
    our ability to conduct our business.


Our
ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance. Our future operating
performance is subject to many factors
 including economic
 financial and competitive factors
 which may be beyond our control.
Additionally
 any failure to meet required payments on our debt
 or failure to comply with any covenants contained in the agreements
governing our existing and any future indebtedness
 could result in an event of default under the terms of those agreements. If
any such event of default is not cured or waived
 our repayment obligations may be accelerated
 and it could result in a default
and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances
 we may not have sufficient
funds to satisfy our repayment obligations.

Worldwide
and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions could adversely impact our financial performance.

We
are subject to risks associated with worldwide and domestic economic conditions
 including economic slowdowns and the disruption
volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets. Although economic conditions in the United States have improved since
the economic downturn several years ago
 future economic deterioration in the United States or worldwide could adversely impact
our major suppliers
 distributors and retailers. The inability of suppliers
 distributors or retailers to conduct business or
to access liquidity could impact our ability to distribute our products. There can be no assurance that market conditions will
not deteriorate in the near future. A prolonged downturn
 worsening or broadening of the adverse conditions in the worldwide and
domestic economies could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products
 and create or exacerbate credit issues
cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers
 distributors
 retailers and consumers. Depending
upon their severity and duration
 these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business
 liquidity
 financial
condition and results of operations.

We
may require additional capital
 which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms
 or at all. Our inability to raise such
capital
 as needed
 on beneficial terms or at all could restrict our future growth and severely limit our operations.

We
have limited capital compared to other companies in our industry. This may limit our operations and growth
 including our ability
to continue to develop existing brands
 service our debt obligations
 maintain adequate inventory levels
 fund potential acquisitions
of new brands
 penetrate new markets
 attract new customers and enter into new distribution relationships. If we have not generated
sufficient cash from operations to finance additional capital needs
 we will need to raise additional funds through private or
public equity and/or debt financing. We cannot assure you that
 if and when needed
 additional financing will be available to
us on acceptable terms or at all. If additional capital is needed and either unavailable or cost prohibitive
 our operations and
growth may be limited as we may need to change our business strategy to slow the rate of
 or eliminate
 our expansion or reduce
or curtail our operations. Also
 any additional financing we undertake could impose covenants upon us that restrict our operating
flexibility
 and
 if we issue equity securities to raise capital our existing shareholders may experience dilution and the new
securities may have rights
 preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.


We
depend on a limited number of suppliers. Failure to obtain satisfactory performance from our suppliers or loss of our existing
suppliers could cause us to lose sales
 incur additional costs and lose credibility in the marketplace. We also have annual purchase
obligations with certain suppliers.

We
depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the sourcing of all of our products
 including both our own proprietary
brands and those we distribute for others. These suppliers consist of third-party distillers
 bottlers and producers in the U.S.
Bermuda
 the Caribbean and Europe. We rely on the owners of Goslings rum
 Pallini liqueurs
 Isle of Arran whiskeys
 and Gozio
amaretto to produce their brands for us. For our proprietary products
 we may rely on a single supplier to fulfill one or all
of the manufacturing functions for a brand. For instance
 IDL is the sole provider of our single malt
 blended and grain Irish
whiskeys. We do not have long-term written agreements with all of our suppliers. We do not currently have a long-term source for
supply of aged rye and there can be no assurance we can source adequate amounts of aged bourbon or rye at satisfactory prices
or at all. Also
 if we fail to complete purchases of products ordered annually
 certain suppliers have the right to bill us for
product not purchased during the period. The termination of our written or oral agreements or an adverse change in the terms of
these agreements could have a negative impact on our business. If our suppliers increase their prices
 we may not have alternative
sources of supply and may not be able to raise the prices of our products to cover all or even a portion of the increased costs.
Also
 our suppliers&rsquo; failure to perform satisfactorily or handle increased orders
 delays in shipments of products from
suppliers or the loss of our existing suppliers
 especially our key suppliers
 could cause us to fail to meet orders for our products
lose sales
 incur additional costs and/or expose us to product quality issues. In turn
 this could cause us to lose credibility
in the marketplace and damage our relationships with distributors
 ultimately leading to a decline in our business and results
of operations. If we are not able to renegotiate these contracts on acceptable terms or find suitable alternatives
 our business
could be negatively impacted.


    
    


We
depend on our independent wholesale distributors to distribute our products. The failure or inability of even a few of our distributors
to adequately distribute our products within their territories could harm our sales and result in a decline in our results of
operations.


We
are required by law to use state licensed distributors or
 in 17 states known as &ldquo;control states
&rdquo; state-owned agencies
performing this function
 to sell our products to retail outlets
 including liquor stores
 bars
 restaurants and national chains
in the U.S. We have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors in each state; however
 failure to maintain
those relationships could significantly and adversely affect our business
 sales and growth. Over the past decade there has been
increasing consolidation
 both intrastate and interstate
 among distributors. As a result
 many states now have only two or three
significant distributors. Also
 there are several distributors that now control distribution for several states. For the fiscal
year ended March 31
 2019
 sales to one distributor accounted for 36.4% of revenues. For the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
sales to this same distributor accounted for 37.2% of revenues. As a result
 if we fail to maintain good relations with a distributor
particularly this distributor
 our products could in some instances be frozen out of one or more markets entirely. The
ultimate success of our products also depends in large part on our distributors&rsquo; ability and desire to distribute our products
to our desired U.S. target markets
 as we rely significantly on them for product placement and retail store penetration. We have
no formal distribution agreements or minimum sales requirements with any of our distributors and they are under no obligation
to place our products or market our brands. Moreover
 all of them also distribute competitive brands and product lines. We cannot
assure you that our U.S. alcohol distributors will continue to purchase our products
 commit sufficient time and resources to
promote and market our brands and product lines or that they can or will sell them to our desired or targeted markets. If they
do not
 our sales will be harmed
 resulting in a decline in our results of operations.

While
most of our international markets do not require the use of independent distributors by law
 we have chosen to conduct our sales
through distributors in all our markets and
 accordingly
 we face similar risks to those set forth above with respect to our international
distribution. Some of these international markets may have only a limited number of viable distributors.

We
must maintain a relatively large inventory of our products
 including aging bourbon
 to support customer delivery requirements
and if this inventory is lost due to theft
 fire or other damage or becomes obsolete
 our results of operations would be negatively
impacted.

We
must maintain relatively large inventories to meet customer delivery requirements for our products. In particular
 we must maintain
sufficient supplies of aging bourbon to support the Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbons. We are always at risk of loss of that inventory
due to theft
 fire or other damage
 and any such loss
 whether insured against or not
 could cause us to fail to meet our orders
and harm our sales and operating results. Also
 our inventory may become obsolete as we introduce new products
 cease to produce
old products or modify the design of our products&rsquo; packaging
 which would increase our operating losses and negatively impact
our results of operations.

If
our brands and brand extensions do not achieve more widespread consumer acceptance
 our growth may be limited.

Most
of our brands are early in their growth cycle and have not achieved extensive brand recognition. Also
 brands we may acquire in
the future are unlikely to have established extensive brand recognition. We continue to develop brand extensions within our current
portfolio of brands. If these new extensions do not gain consumer acceptance
 our growth may be limited. Accordingly
 if consumers
do not accept our brands and brand extensions
 we will not be able to penetrate our markets and our growth may be limited.

Our
growth could be limited if we are unable to successfully acquire additional brands
 and
 even if additional brands are acquired
such acquisitions may have a negative impact on our results of operations.

We
have in the past
 and may in the future
 acquire additional brands that are complementary to our existing portfolio through acquisitions
of such brands or their corporate owners
 directly or through mergers
 joint ventures
 long-term exclusive distribution arrangements
and/or other strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully execute such acquisitions
 our growth could be limited.
Also
 even if we are successful in acquiring additional brands
 we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability levels
that justify our investment in
 or realize operating and economic efficiencies or other planned benefits with respect to
 those
additional brands. The addition of new products or businesses entails numerous risks with respect to integration and other operating
issues
 any of which could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations and/or the value of our equity. These risks
include:



    
difficulties
    in assimilating acquired operations or products;

    
unanticipated
    costs that could materially adversely affect our results of operations;

    
negative
    effects on reported results of operations from acquisition related charges and amortization of acquired intangibles;

    
diversion
    of management&rsquo;s attention from other business concerns;

    
adverse
    effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 distributors and retail customers;

    
risks
    of entering new markets or markets in which we have limited prior experience; and

    
the
    potential inability to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses.


Also
there are special risks associated with the acquisition of additional brands through joint venture arrangements. We may not have
a majority interest in
 or control of
 future joint ventures in which we may enter. There is
 therefore
 risk that our joint venture
partners may at any time have economic
 business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals
or those of the joint venture. There is also risk that our current or future joint venture partners may be unable to meet their
economic or other obligations and that we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.

Our
ability to grow through the acquisition of additional brands will also be dependent upon the availability of capital to complete
the necessary acquisition arrangements. We intend to finance potential brand acquisitions through a combination of our available
cash resources
 third-party financing and
 in appropriate circumstances
 the further issuance of equity and/or debt securities;
however
 our ability to finance such acquisitions may be limited by the terms of our other equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring
additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position
 and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly
and yearly operating results. Also
 acquisitions could result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on
our financial statements
 the amortization or impairment of which would reduce reported earnings in subsequent years.


    
    


Currency
exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations may have a significant adverse effect on our revenues
 sales
 costs of goods and overall
financial results.

For
fiscal 2019
 non-U.S. operations accounted for approximately 9% of our revenues. Therefore
 gains and losses on the conversion
of foreign payments into U.S. dollars could cause fluctuations in our results of operations
 and fluctuating exchange rates could
cause reduced revenues and/or gross margins from non-U.S. dollar-denominated international sales and inventory purchases. Also
for fiscal 2019
 Euro denominated sales accounted for approximately 5% of our total revenue
 so a substantial change in the rate
of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the Euro could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. Our ability
to acquire spirits and produce and sell our products at favorable prices will also depend in part on the relative strength of
the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge against these risks.

We
have previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
 and our business and stock
price may be adversely affected if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over
financial reporting.


Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting
 as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended. As disclosed in Item 9A in our annual report for
the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 as of  March 31
 2018 and 2017
 management identified
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the reconciliation of inventory transfers
between domestic and foreign locations and a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the
allocation of excise taxes and freight costs to inventory
 respectively. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency
or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because
of this material weakness
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based
on criteria set forth by the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. If other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or
occur in the future
 it may result in untimely or inaccurate reporting of our financial condition or results of operations. Ineffective
internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information
 which could have a negative
effect on the trading price of our common stock
 limit our ability to access the capital markets in the future and require us
to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.

A
failure of one or more of our key information technology systems
 networks
 processes
 associated sites or service providers
including as a result of evolving cyber security and other technological risks
 could have a material adverse impact on our business.

We
rely on information technology (IT) systems
 networks
 and services
 including internet sites
 data hosting and processing facilities
and tools
 hardware (including laptops and mobile devices)
 software and technical applications and platforms
 some of which are
managed
 hosted
 provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors
 to assist us in the management of our business. The various
uses of these IT systems
 networks
 and services include
 but are not limited to: hosting our internal network and communication
systems; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; supply/demand planning; production; shipping product to customers; hosting
our branded websites and marketing products to consumers; collecting and storing customer
 consumer
 employee
 investor
 and other
data; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting
 processing
 and sharing confidential
and proprietary research
 business plans
 and financial information; complying with regulatory
 legal or tax requirements; providing
data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business.

Increased
IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems
 networks
 and
services
 as well as the confidentiality
 availability
 and integrity of our data. If the IT systems
 networks
 or service providers
we rely upon fail to function properly
 or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information
 due to
any number of causes
 ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches
 and our business continuity plans
do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis
 we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and
reputational
 competitive and/or business harm
 which may adversely affect our business operations and/or financial condition.
In addition
 such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information
 and we may suffer financial
and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners
 our employees
customers
 suppliers or consumers. In any of these events
 we could also be required to spend significant financial and other
resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems. The trend toward public
notifications of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business operations or financial condition.

Either
our or our strategic partners&rsquo; failure to protect our respective intellectual property rights could compromise our competitive
position and decrease the value of our brand portfolio.

Our
business and prospects depend in part on our
 and with respect to our agency or joint venture brands
 our strategic partners&rsquo;
ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of our brands and trademarks. Although both we and our strategic partners actively
apply for intellectual property registrations of our brands and trademarks
 they could be imitated in ways that we cannot prevent.
Also
 we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how
 concepts and formulas. We cannot be certain that the steps taken to protect
these intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect these rights. Our business could be adversely affected by the
material infringement of such intellectual property rights. We are also subject to risks and costs associated with the enforcement
of our and our partners&rsquo; intellectual property rights. Moreover
 we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement
of third parties&rsquo; rights that could interfere with our use of this information. Defending these claims may be costly and
if unsuccessful
 may prevent us from continuing to use this proprietary information in the future and result in a judgment or
monetary damages being levied against us. We do not maintain non-competition agreements with all of our key personnel or with
some of our key suppliers. If competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to our or our strategic partners&rsquo;
trade secrets
 proprietary know-how or recipes
 the appeal
 and thus the value
 of our brand portfolio could be reduced
 negatively
impacting our financial results and ability to develop our business.


    
    


Our
failure to attract or retain key executive or employee talent could adversely affect our business.

Our
success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team
 other key employees
 and a high-quality employee
base
 as well as our ability to attract
 motivate
 reward
 and retain them. We do not maintain and do not intend to obtain key
man insurance on the life of any executive or employee. Difficulties in hiring or retaining key executive or employee talent
or the unexpected loss of experienced employees could have an adverse impact on our business performance. In addition
 we could
experience business disruption and/or increased costs related to organizational changes
 reductions in workforce
 or other cost-cutting
measures.

The
sales of our products could decrease significantly if we cannot maintain listings in the control states.

In
the control states
 the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and
offered for sale in their respective states. Products selected for listing must generally reach certain volumes and/or profit
levels to maintain their listings. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally
made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Products not selected for listings can only
be purchased by consumers in the applicable control state through special orders
 if at all. If
 in the future
 we are unable
to maintain our current listings in the control states
 or secure and maintain listings in those states for any additional products
we may acquire
 sales of our products could decrease significantly.

An
impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results
and shareholders&rsquo; equity.

The
carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as
of the acquisition date
 net of any cumulative impairments. The carrying value of other intangible assets represents the fair
value of trademarks
 trade names and other acquired intangible assets as of the acquisition date
 net of impairments and accumulated
amortization. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized
but must be evaluated for impairment by our management at least annually. If carrying value exceeds current fair value as determined
based on the discounted future cash flows of the related business
 the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced
to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. If the value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets is impaired
 our
earnings and shareholders&rsquo; equity could be adversely affected.

Risks
Related to Our Industry

Demand
for our products may be adversely affected by many factors
 including changes in consumer preferences and trends.

Consumer
preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic and social trends
 public health initiatives
product innovations
 changes in vacation or leisure activity patterns and a downturn in economic conditions
 which may reduce
consumers&rsquo; willingness to purchase distilled spirits or cause a shift in consumer preferences toward beer
 wine or non-alcoholic
beverages. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in
consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations. The competitive position of our brands could also be
affected adversely by any failure to achieve consistent
 reliable quality in the product or in service levels to customers.

Our
business performance is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of rum
 whiskey and ginger beer sales.

A
significant part of our business is based on rum
 whiskey and ginger beer sales
 which represented approximately 89% and 88% of
our revenues for fiscal 2019 and 2018
 respectively. Changes in consumer preferences regarding these categories of products may
have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Given the importance of our rum
 whiskey and ginger beer brands to
our overall success
 a significant or sustained decline in volume or selling price of these products would likely have a negative
effect on our growth and our stock price. Additionally
 should we not be successful in our efforts to maintain and increase the
relevance of the brands in the minds of today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s consumer
 our business and operating results could
suffer.

We
face substantial competition in our industry and many factors may prevent us from competing successfully.

We
compete based on product taste and quality
 brand image
 price
 service and ability to innovate in response to consumer preferences.
The global spirits industry is highly competitive and is dominated by several large
 well-funded international companies. It is
possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or effectively or resort
to price competition to sustain market share
 which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.


    
    


Adverse
public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products.

Anti-alcohol
groups have
 in the past
 advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements
 higher taxes and other regulations
designed to discourage alcohol consumption. More restrictive regulations
 negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or
changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption
of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could
 in turn
 significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue
growth
 causing a decline in our results of operations.

Class
action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adversely affect our business.

Companies
in the beverage alcohol industry are
 from time to time
 exposed to class action or other litigation relating to alcohol advertising
product liability
 alcohol abuse problems or health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. It is also possible that governments
could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government funded health care costs. Litigation or assertions
of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry
 and it is possible that we
 as well as our suppliers
could be named in litigation of this type.

Also
lawsuits have been brought in a number of states alleging that beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted
underage consumers in their advertising. Plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants&rsquo; advertisements
 marketing
and promotions violate the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in each of these states and seek repayment
of the family funds expended by the underage consumers. While we have not been named in these lawsuits
 we could be named in similar
lawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend
against
 depleting our cash and diverting our personnel resources and
 if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail
 our
business could be harmed significantly.

Regulatory
decisions and legal
 regulatory and tax changes could limit our business activities
 increase our operating costs and reduce our
margins.

Our
business is subject to extensive regulation in all of the countries in which we operate. This may include regulations regarding
production
 distribution
 marketing
 advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products. We are required to comply with these
regulations and to maintain various permits and licenses. We are also required to conduct business only with holders of licenses
to import
 warehouse
 transport
 distribute and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other governmental
regulations applicable to our industry will not change or become more stringent. Moreover
 because these laws and regulations
are subject to interpretation
 we may not be able to predict when and to what extent liability may arise. Additionally
 due to
increasing public concern over alcohol-related societal problems
 including driving while intoxicated
 underage drinking
 alcoholism
and health consequences from the abuse of alcohol
 various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions or
limits on advertising or other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current
or future regulations and requirements relating to our industry and products could result in monetary penalties
 suspension or
even revocation of our licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm
our business
 as we could find it necessary to raise our prices to maintain profit margins
 which could lower the demand for our
products and reduce our sales and profit potential.

Also
the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation both in the U.S. and internationally (and
 in the
U.S.
 at both the federal and state government levels)
 and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import
and excise duties in most countries around the world. An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly
harm our sales revenue and margins
 both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to
lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol.

We
could face product liability or other related liabilities that increase our costs of operations and harm our reputation.

Although
we maintain liability insurance and will attempt to limit contractually our liability for damages arising from our products
 these
measures may not be sufficient for us to avoid or limit liability. Our product liability insurance coverage is limited to $1.0
million per occurrence and $2.0 million in the aggregate and our general liability umbrella policy is capped at $10.0 million.
Further
 any contractual indemnification and insurance coverage we have from parties supplying our products is limited
 as a practical
matter
 to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by these suppliers.
In any event
 extensive product liability claims could be costly to defend and/or costly to resolve and could harm our reputation.

Contamination
of our products and/or counterfeit or confusingly similar products could harm the image and integrity of
 or decrease customer
support for
 our brands and decrease our sales.

The
success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of them. Contamination
 whether arising accidentally
or through deliberate third-party action
 or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands
 could affect
the demand for our products. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our products
or defects in the distillation
 fermentation or bottling processes could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among
or injury to
 consumers of our products and could result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands. We may also
be required to recall products in the event of contamination or damage. Also
 to the extent that third parties sell products that
are either counterfeit versions of our brands or brands that look like our brands
 consumers of our brands could confuse our products
with products that they consider inferior. This could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn
could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our sales and operations.


    
    


Risks
Relating to Owning Our Stock

The
price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly
 and this may make it difficult for you to resell the shares of our stock
at prices you find attractive.

The
trading price of our common stock
 as reported by the NYSE American
 has ranged from a low of $0.67 to a high of $1.42 per share
for the 52 week period ended March 31
 2019. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate significantly.

The
market price of our stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors
 many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:



    
variations
    in quarterly operating results;

    
general
    economic and business conditions;

    
trading
    prices of similar securities;

    
fluctuations
    in stock market prices and volume;

    
our
    announcements of significant contracts
 milestones or acquisitions;

    
rebalancing
    of stock indices in which our common stock may be included;

    
our
    relationships with other companies
 including our suppliers and distributors;

    
our
    ability to obtain needed capital;

    
sales
    of common stock
 conversion of securities convertible into common stock
 exercise of options to purchase common stock or termination
    of stock transfer restrictions;

    
changes
    in financial estimates by securities analysts;

    
additions
    or departures of key personnel;

    
the
    initiation or outcome of litigation or arbitration proceedings; and

    
legislation
    or regulatory policies
 practices or actions.


Any
one of these factors could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Also
 the stock market in recent years
has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have materially affected the market prices of equity securities
of many companies and that often have been unrelated to such companies&rsquo; operating performance. These market fluctuations
have adversely impacted the price of our common stock in the past and may do so in the future. Also
 shareholders may initiate
securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly
 which may cause us to incur substantial
costs and divert our management&rsquo;s time and attention. These factors
 among others
 could significantly depress the price
of our common stock.

We
may not be able to maintain our listing on the NYSE American
 which may limit the ability of our shareholders to sell their common
stock.

If
we do not meet the NYSE American continued listing criteria
 we may be delisted and trading of our common stock could be conducted
in the OTC Bulletin Board or the interdealer quotation systems of the OTC Markets Group Inc. In such case
 a shareholder likely
would find it more difficult to trade our common stock or to obtain accurate market quotations for it. If our common stock is
delisted
 it will become subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock rules
&rdquo; which impose
sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell that common stock to persons other than established customers and &ldquo;accredited
investors.&rdquo; Application of this rule could make broker-dealers unable or unwilling to sell our common stock and limit the
ability of shareholders to sell their common stock in the secondary market.

Our
executive officers
 directors and principal shareholders own a substantial percentage of our voting stock
 which allows them to
significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval. They could make business decisions for us that cause our stock
price to decline.

As
of June 8
 2019
 our executive officers
 directors and principal shareholders beneficially owned approximately 42% of our common
stock
 including options that are exercisable within 60 days of the date of this annual report and assuming full exercise of such
options held by such persons. As a result
 if they act in concert
 they could significantly influence matters requiring approval
by our shareholders
 including the election of directors
 and could have the ability to prevent or cause a corporate transaction
even if other shareholders oppose such action. This concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying
 deterring
or preventing a change of control or other business combination
 which could cause our stock price to decline.

Provisions
in our articles of incorporation
 our bylaws and Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us
 discourage
a takeover and adversely affect existing shareholders.

Our
articles of incorporation
 our bylaws and the Florida Business Corporation Act contain provisions that may have the effect of
making more difficult
 delaying
 or deterring attempts by others to obtain control of our company
 even when these attempts may
be in the best interests of our shareholders. These include provisions limiting the shareholders&rsquo; powers to remove directors.
Our articles of incorporation also authorize our board of directors
 without shareholder approval
 to issue one or more series
of preferred stock
 which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders
of our common stock. Florida law also imposes conditions on certain &ldquo;affiliated transactions&rdquo; with &ldquo;interested
shareholders.&rdquo;


    
    


These
provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our
control or management
 including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then
current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem
to be in their best interests.

Negative
publicity could affect our stock price and business performance.

Unfavorable
media related to our industry
 company
 brands
 marketing
 personnel
 operations
 business performance
 or prospects could negatively
affect our corporate reputation
 stock price
 ability to attract high quality talent
 and/or the performance of our business
regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. Adverse publicity or negative commentary on social media outlets could cause consumers
to avoid our brands and/or choose brands offered by our competitors
 which could negatively affect our financial results.

Item
2. Properties

Our
executive offices are located in New York
 NY
 where we lease approximately 5
000 square feet of office space under a lease that

 Ireland under a lease that expires
in October 2019 and approximately 1
700 square feet of office space in Houston
 TX under a lease that expires in June 2021.

Item
3. Legal Proceedings

We
believe that neither we nor any of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is currently subject to litigation which
 in the opinion of our
management
 is likely to have a material adverse effect on us.

We
may
 however
 become involved in litigation from time to time relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business.
These claims
 even if not meritorious
 could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

Item
7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations



Our
objective is to continue building Castle Brands into a profitable international spirits company
 with a distinctive portfolio
of premium and super premium spirits brands. To achieve this
 we continue to seek to:



    
focus
 We continue to focus our distribution efforts
 sales expertise and targeted
    marketing activities on our more profitable brands and markets;

    
grow
 We believe that continued organic growth will enable us to achieve long-term profitability. We focus
    on brands that have profitable growth potential and staying power
 such as our rums
 whiskeys and ginger beer
 sales of which
    have grown substantially in recent years;

    
focus
 We continue to innovate in our portfolio by developing new brand extensions
 expressions
 blends and
    processes
 such as our Ocean Aged at Sea bourbons and our wine-finishes for our bourbons and Irish whiskeys. We believe that
    continued focus on innovation will drive sales growth
 build brand loyalty
 and open new markets;

    
leverage
 Our established distribution network in all 50 U.S. states enables us to promote our brands
    nationally and makes us an attractive strategic partner for smaller companies seeking U.S. distribution;

    
selectively
 We continue to explore strategic relationships
 joint ventures and acquisitions
    to selectively expand our premium spirits portfolio. For example
 we added the Arran Scotch whiskeys to our portfolio as agency
    brands. We expect that future acquisitions or agency relations
 if any
 would involve some combination of cash
 debt and the
    issuance of our stock; and

    
build
 We use our existing assets
 expertise and resources to build consumer awareness and market penetration
    for our brands.


Recent
Developments

Craft
Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2017

We
recognized a $1.0 million reduction in excise taxes in the fiscal year ended March 31
 2019 due to changes to excise tax rates
resulting from the enactment of the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2017. The amount resulted in a $1.0 million
increase in our gross margin for our full fiscal year ended March 31
 2019. We expect to recognize a similar benefit in
our 2020 fiscal year.

Operations
overview

We
generate revenue through the sale of our products to our network of wholesale distributors or
 in control states
 state-operated
agencies
 which
 in turn
 distribute our products to retail outlets. In the U.S.
 our sales price per case includes excise tax
and import duties
 which are also reflected as a corresponding increase in our cost of sales. Most of our international sales
are sold &ldquo;in bond&rdquo;
 with the excise taxes paid by our customers upon shipment
 thereby resulting in lower relative
revenue as well as a lower relative cost of sales
 although some of our United Kingdom sales are sold &ldquo;tax paid&rdquo;
as in the U.S. The difference between sales and net sales principally reflects adjustments for various distributor incentives.


    
    


Our
gross profit is determined by the prices at which we sell our products
 our ability to control our cost of sales
 the relative
mix of our case sales by brand and geography and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our cost of sales is principally
driven by our cost of procurement
 bottling and packaging
 which differs by brand
 as well as freight and warehousing costs. We
purchase certain products
 such as Goslings rums and ginger beer
 Pallini liqueurs
 Arran whiskeys
 and Gozio amaretto
 as finished
goods. For other products
 such as Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbons
 we purchase the components
 including the distilled spirits
 bottles
and packaging materials
 and have arrangements with third parties for bottling and packaging. Our U.S. sales typically have a
higher absolute gross margin than in other markets
 as sales prices per case are generally higher in the U.S.

Selling
expense principally includes advertising and marketing expenditures and compensation paid to our marketing and sales personnel.
Our selling expense
 as a percentage of sales and per case
 is higher than that of our competitors because of our brand development
costs
 level of marketing expenditures and established sales force versus our relatively small base of case sales and sales volumes.
However
 we believe that maintaining an infrastructure capable of supporting future growth is the correct long-term approach for
us.

While
we expect the absolute level of selling expense to increase in the coming years
 we expect selling expense as a percentage of
revenues and on a per case basis to decline or remain constant
 as our volumes expand and our sales team sells a larger number
of brands.

General
and administrative expense relates to corporate and administrative functions that support our operations and includes administrative
payroll
 occupancy and related expenses and professional services. We expect general and administrative expense in fiscal 2020
to be higher than fiscal 2019 due to costs associated with increased infrastructure to support our growth. However
 we expect
our general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales to decline due to economies of scale.

We
expect to increase our case sales in the U.S. and internationally over the next several years through organic growth
 and through
the introduction of product line extensions
 acquisitions and distribution agreements. We will seek to maintain liquidity and
manage our working capital and overall capital resources during this period of anticipated growth to achieve our long-term objectives
although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.

We
continue to believe the following industry trends will create growth opportunities for us
 including:



    
the
    divestiture of smaller and emerging non-core brands by major spirits companies as they continue to consolidate;

    
    

    
increased
    barriers to entry
 particularly in the U.S.
 due to continued consolidation and the difficulty in establishing an extensive
    distribution network
 such as the one we maintain; and

    
    

    
the
    trend by small private and family-owned spirits brand owners to partner with
 or be acquired by
 a company with global distribution.
    We expect to be an attractive alternative to our larger competitors for these brand owners as one of the few modestly-sized
    publicly-traded spirits companies.


Our
growth strategy is based upon growing existing brands
 partnering with other brands and acquiring smaller and emerging brands.
To identify potential partner and acquisition candidates we plan to rely on our management&rsquo;s industry experience and our
extensive network of industry contacts. We also plan to maintain and grow our U.S. and international distribution channels so
that we are more attractive to spirits companies who are looking for a route to market for their products. We expect to compete
for foreign and small private and family-owned spirits brands by offering flexible and creative structures
 which present an alternative
to the larger spirits companies.


    
    


We
intend to finance any future brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources
 third party financing and
in appropriate circumstances
 the further issuance of equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring additional brands could have a
significant effect on our financial position
 and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results.
Also
 the pursuit of acquisitions and other new business relationships may require significant management attention. We may not
be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates
 obtain financing on favorable terms or complete these types
of transactions in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us
 if at all.

Critical
accounting policies and estimates

A
number of estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 amounts of sales and expenses and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis
 we evaluate these estimates and assumptions
based on historical experience and other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under
the circumstances; however
 actual results may differ from these estimates.

We
believe that the estimates and assumptions discussed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
results of operations in that they require our most difficult
 subjective or complex judgments and form the basis for the accounting
policies deemed to be most critical to our operations.

Revenue
recognition

We
recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to a customer (generally a distributor)
 title and risk of loss
has passed to the customer under the terms of sale (FOB shipping point) and collection is reasonably assured. We do not offer
a right of return but will accept returns if we shipped the wrong product or wrong quantity. Revenue is not recognized on shipments
to control states in the U.S. until such time as the product is sold through to the retail channel.

Accounts
receivable

We
record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts.
We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs
 level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables
and our relationships with
 and economic status of
 our customers.

Inventory
valuation

Our
inventory
 which consists of distilled spirits
 non-beverage alcohol products
 dry good raw materials (bottles
 cans
 labels and
caps)
 packaging
 excise taxes
 freight and finished goods
 is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 using the
weighted average cost method. We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that
are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value. We estimate the net realizable value of
such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including
 but not limited to
 historical usage
 future demand and market requirements.
Reduction to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold.


    
    


Goodwill
and other intangible assets

At
each of March 31
 2019 and 2018
 we had $0.5 million of goodwill that arose from acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess
of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses
acquired. Intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of rights
 trademarks
 trade names and formulations. We are
required to analyze our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as well as
when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In testing goodwill for impairment
 we have the option
to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that
it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not
 we are then required
to perform a quantitative impairment test
 otherwise no further analysis is required. We may also elect not to perform the qualitative
assessment and
 instead
 proceed direct to the quantitative impairment test. Under the goodwill qualitative assessment
 various
events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified
 including
 but not limited
to: prior years&rsquo; impairment testing results
 budget to actual results
 Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry
developments
 and the economic environment.

Under
the goodwill two-step quantitative impairment test we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
assets at the reporting unit level. In the first step the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value
including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value
 a second step is performed which
compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit&rsquo;s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. The fair value for the
goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable
assets and liabilities of such reporting units. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value
 the difference
is recognized as an impairment.

Under
the goodwill qualitative assessment at March 31
 2019 and 2018
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated
fair value of each reporting unit were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&rsquo; impairment testing results
budget to actual results
 Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based
on this assessment
 we determined that no quantitative assessment was required. We did not record any impairment on goodwill or
other intangible assets for fiscal 2019
 2018 or 2017.

Intangible
assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values
and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
We are required to amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to the
estimated residual values and to review intangible assets with estimable useful lives for impairment in accordance with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 310
 &ldquo;Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-lived Assets.&rdquo;

Stock-based
awards

We
follow current authoritative guidance regarding stock-based compensation
 which requires all share-based payments
 including grants
of stock options and restricted stock
 to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense
 based on their fair values
on the grant date. Stock-based compensation was $2.0 million
 $2.0 million and $1.6 million for fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.
We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The assumptions used in valuing the
options granted during fiscal 2017 are included in note 12 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Fair
value of financial instruments

ASC
825
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments&rdquo;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial
instruments. We believe that there is no material difference between the fair value and the reported amounts of financial instruments
in the balance sheets due to the short-term maturity of these instruments
 or with respect to the debt
 as compared to the current
borrowing rates available to us.

 net
 income from equity investment in non-consolidated
affiliate
 foreign exchange loss (income) and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is a key metric we use in evaluating
our financial performance. EBITDA
 as adjusted
 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated
by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended. We consider EBITDA
 as adjusted
 important in evaluating our performance
on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-cash and non-recurring items
 EBITDA
 as adjusted
enables our Board of Directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. We use EBITDA
 as adjusted
as a primary measure
 among others
 to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating
investments and allocation of capital resources. We believe that EBITDA
 as adjusted
 eliminates items that are not indicative
of our core operating performance or are based on management&rsquo;s estimates
 such as allowance accounts
 are due to changes
in valuation
 such as the effects of changes in foreign exchange or do not involve a cash outlay
 such as stock-based compensation
expense and in the quarter ended December 31
 2018
 a one-time $1.0 million charge to professional fees. Our
presentation of EBITDA
 as adjusted
 should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual
or non-recurring items or by non-cash items
 such as stock-based compensation
 which is expected to remain a key element in our
long-term incentive compensation program. EBITDA
 as adjusted
 should be considered in addition to
 rather than as a substitute
for
 income from operations
 net income and cash flows from operating activities.

Fiscal
2019 compared with Fiscal 2018

Net
sales.
 2019
 as compared to $89.9 million for the prior
fiscal year
 primarily due to U.S. sales growth of Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbons
 Knappogue Castle Irish whiskey and Goslings Stormy
Ginger Beer
 partially offset by the impact of the release of high revenue specialty releases of our Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbon
in the prior fiscal year and decreases in Clontarf and Arran whiskey sales and certain of our liqueurs in the year ended March
31
 2019. We expect to continue to focus on our faster growing brands and markets
 both in the U.S. and internationally
 including
the release of high revenue specialty releases of our Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbons in future periods.

The
table below presents the increase or decrease
 as applicable
 in case sales by spirits product category for the year ended March

Our
international spirits case sales as a percentage of total spirits case sales decreased to 18.5% for the year ended March 31
 2019
as compared to 19.6% for the prior fiscal year
 primarily due to decreased Irish whiskey and rum sales in certain international
markets resulting in part from the timing of shipments to large retailers in Ireland and Scandinavia.

Gross
profit.
 2019 from $36.2 million for the prior
fiscal year
 while gross margin decreased to 39.2% for the year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to 40.3% for the prior
fiscal year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a temporary increase in aggregate costs of our bulk bourbon
in the current period and to the impact of the release of high margin specialty releases of our Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbon
in the prior fiscal year. We expect gross margin will improve over the long-term as our lower-cost new-fill bourbon ages and becomes
available for use across all of our Jefferson&rsquo;s expressions. Gross profit was positively impacted by a rebate of $1.0 million
on excise taxes recognized under the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2017 in the fiscal year ended March 31
2019
 and we expect a similar benefit in our next fiscal year. The timing and amount of such future rebates remains subject to
the review and approval of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency. During the year ended March 31
 2019
 we recorded additions
to allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory of $0.5 million. We recorded this write-off and allowance on both raw materials
and finished goods
 primarily in connection with label and packaging changes made to certain brands
 as well as certain cost estimates
and variances. The net charge has been recorded as an increase to cost of sales in the relevant period.

Selling
expense
 2019 from $21.8 million for the prior
fiscal year
 primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in employee costs and a $0.5 million increase in shipping costs
 partially
offset by a $0.6 million decrease in advertising
 marketing and promotion expense related to the timing of certain sales and marketing
programs
 including Goslings&rsquo; sponsorship of the 35th America&rsquo;s Cup
 in the prior fiscal year. Selling expense as
a percentage of net sales decreased to 23.3% for the year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to 24.2% for the prior fiscal year
due to increased revenues in the current period.

General
and administrative expense
2019 from $9.4 million for the prior fiscal year
 primarily due to a one-time $1.0 million increase in professional fees in the
quarter ended December 31
 2018 and a $0.7 million increase in employee costs. General and administrative expense as a percentage
of net sales increased to 11.4% for the year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to 10.5% for the prior fiscal year.

Depreciation
and amortization.
 2019 as compared to $0.8 million
for the prior fiscal year.

Income
from operations
 we had income from operations of $3.7 million for the year ended March
31
 2019 as compared to income from operations of $4.2 million for the prior fiscal year. As a result of our focus on our stronger
growth markets and better performing brands
 and expected growth from our existing brands
 we anticipate improved results of operations
in the near term as compared to prior years
 although there is no assurance that we will attain such results.

Income
tax benefit (expense)
 net.
 net is the estimated tax expense primarily
attributable to the net taxable income recorded by GCP
 our 80.1% owned subsidiary
 adjusted for changes in the deferred tax asset
and deferred tax liability during the periods. Based on historical operating results
 projected positive trend of earnings and
projected future taxable income
 we concluded as of March 31
 2019 that certain of our U.S. deferred tax assets are realizable
on a more-likely-than-not basis. As a result
 we released $9.6 million of valuation allowance
 which resulted in a net income
tax benefit (expense) of $9.4 million for the year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to expense of ($0.1)
million in the prior fiscal year.

Our
provision for income taxes consists principally of state and local taxes in amounts necessary to align our year-to-date tax provision
with the effective rate that we expect to achieve for the full year.

For
the year ended March 31
 2019
 we recorded an income tax benefit of $9.4 million. The effective tax rate
for the year ended March 31
 2019 was (1
571.08)%. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 21% as we
concluded that our deferred tax assets are realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis.

We
maintain a valuation allowance on Section 163(j) deferred interest carryforwards and a partial valuation allowance on certain
state net operating losses. Our valuation allowance decreased by $9.6 million during fiscal 2019 as certain of our U.S. deferred
tax assets became realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis as of March 31
 2019. 

Foreign
exchange.
 2019 was $0.2 million as compared to a net expense of ($0.8)
million for the prior fiscal year due to the net effects of fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and its impact on
our Euro-denominated intercompany balances due to our foreign subsidiaries for inventory purchases.


    
    



Interest
expense
 net.
 net of ($4.6) million for the year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to ($3.8) million
for the prior fiscal year due to balances outstanding under our credit facilities and long-term debt. Due to the expected borrowings
under our credit facilities to finance additional purchases of aged whiskies in support of the growth of our Jefferson&rsquo;s
bourbons and other working capital needs
 we expect interest expense
 net to increase in the near term as compared to prior years
although we continue to evaluate alternative financing options.

Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
for the year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to $1.1 million for the prior fiscal year
 as a result of net income allocated to
the 19.9% noncontrolling interests in GCP.

Net
income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.
 net income
attributable to common shareholders was $5.7 million for the year ended March 31
 2019 as compared to a net loss of
($0.8) million for the prior fiscal year. Net income per common share
 basic and diluted
 was $0.03 per share for the year
ended March 31
 2019 as compared to net loss per common share
 basic and diluted
 of ($0.01) per share for the year

 2018.


EBITDA

 primarily due to our increased sales and gross profit.

Fiscal
2018 compared with fiscal 2017

Net
sales.
 2018
 as compared to $77.3 million for the
prior fiscal year
 primarily due to U.S. sales growth of our whiskey portfolio
 Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer and certain liqueur
brands
 partially offset by decreases in vodka and rum sales. For the year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of our Goslings Stormy
Ginger Beer increased 32.7% to $26.5 million. The launch of Arran whiskeys during the year ended March 31
 2018 contributed $1.2
million in sales. We continue to focus on our faster growing brands and markets
 both in the U.S. and internationally.

Our
international spirits case sales as a percentage of total spirits case sales increased to 19.6% for the year ended March 31

as compared to 18.0% for the prior fiscal year
 primarily due to increased Irish whiskey and rum sales in certain international
markets resulting in part from the timing of shipments to large retailers in Ireland and Scandinavia.

 2018 from $31.7 million for the prior fiscal
year
 while gross margin decreased to 40.4% for the year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to 41.0% for the prior fiscal year.
The increase in gross profit was due to increased aggregate revenue in the current period
 partially offset by increased cost
of sales in the current period. The small decrease in gross margin was primarily due to pricing of some of our ancillary brands.
During the year ended March 31
 2018
 we recorded an addition to the allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory of $0.4
million as compared to $0.2 million for the prior fiscal year. We recorded these write-offs and allowances on both raw materials
and finished goods
 primarily in connection with label and packaging changes made to certain brands
 as well as certain cost estimates
and variances. The net charges have been recorded as an increase to cost of sales in the relevant period.

Selling
expense
 2018 from $20.1 million for the prior
fiscal year
 primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in advertising
 marketing and promotion expense related to the timing of
certain sales and marketing programs
 including Goslings&rsquo; sponsorship of the 35th America&rsquo;s Cup
 a $0.5 million increase
in shipping costs and a $0.3 million increase in commission expense from increased sales volume
 partially offset by a $0.5 million
decrease in employee expense. Selling expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 24.2% for the year ended March 31
 2018
as compared to 26.0% for the prior fiscal year.


    
    


General
and administrative expense.
2018 from $8.6 million for the prior fiscal year
 primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in professional fees and a $0.5 million

Liquidity
and capital resources



Since
our inception
 we have incurred significant net losses and have not generated positive cash flows from operations. For the year
ended March 31
 2019
 we had net income of $8.8 million
 and used cash of $8.5 million in operating activities.
As of March 31
 2019
 we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.5 million and had an accumulated deficit of $144.2 million.

We
believe our current cash and working capital and the availability under the Credit Facility (as defined below) will enable us
to fund our losses until we achieve profitability
 ensure continuity of supply of our brands
 and support new brand initiatives
and marketing programs through at least June 2020. We believe we can continue to meet our operating needs through additional mechanisms
if necessary
 including additional or expanded debt financings
 potential equity offerings and limiting or adjusting the timing
of additional inventory purchases based on available resources.

We
are currently negotiating the restructuring of all or a portion of our debt
 including the Subordinated Note. This
restructuring may consist of a combination of expanding and extending the Loan Agreement and Credit Facility with ACF
extending the term of the Subordinated Note
 or other methods of paying down the debt
 although there is no assurance that we
will be successful in such restructuring.




We
and our wholly-owned subsidiary
 CB-USA
 are parties to an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as amended
 the &ldquo;Loan
Agreement&rdquo;) with ACF FinCo I LP (&ldquo;ACF&rdquo;)
 which provides for availability (subject to certain terms and conditions)
of a facility (the &ldquo;Credit Facility&rdquo;) to provide us with working capital
 including capital to finance purchases of
aged whiskeys in support of the growth of our Jefferson&rsquo;s whiskeys. We and CB-USA entered into four amendments to
the Loan Agreement during our 2019 fiscal year which increased the maximum amount of the Credit Facility from $21.0 million to
$27.0 million
 including a sublimit in the maximum principal amount of $7.0 million to permit us to acquire aged whiskey inventory
(the &ldquo;Purchased Inventory Sublimit&rdquo;) subject to certain conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Credit Facility
matures on July 31
 2020 (the &ldquo;Maturity Date&rdquo;). The monthly facility fee is 0.75% per annum of the maximum Credit
Facility amount (excluding the Purchased Inventory Sublimit).

Pursuant
to the Loan Agreement
 we and CB-USA may borrow up to the lesser of (x) $27.0 million and (y) the sum of the borrowing base calculated
in accordance with the Loan Agreement and the Purchased Inventory Sublimit. We and CB-USA may prepay the Credit Facility in whole
or the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 in whole or in part
 subject to certain prepayment penalties as set forth in the Loan Agreement.


    
    


ACF
required as a condition to entering into an amendment to the Loan Agreement in August 2015 that ACF enter into a participation
agreement with certain related parties of ours
 including Frost Gamma Investments Trust
 an entity affiliated with Phillip Frost
M.D.
 a director of ours and a principal shareholder of ours ($150
000)
 Mark E. Andrews
 III
 a director of ours and our Chairman
($50
000)
 Richard J. Lampen
 a director of ours and our President and Chief Executive Officer ($100
000)
 Brian L. Heller
 our
General Counsel and Assistant Secretary ($42
500)
 and Alfred J. Small
 our Senior Vice President
 Chief Financial Officer
 Treasurer
&amp; Secretary ($15
000)
 to allow for the sale of participation interests in the Purchased Inventory Sublimit and the inventory
purchased with the proceeds thereof. The participation agreement provides that ACF&rsquo;s commitment to fund each advance of
the Purchased Inventory Sublimit shall be limited to seventy percent (70%)
 up to an aggregate maximum principal amount for all
advances equal to $4.9 million. Under the terms of the participation agreement
 the participants receive interest at the rate
of 11% per annum. We are not a party to the participation agreement. However
 we and CB-USA are party to a fee letter with the
junior participants (including the related party junior participants) pursuant to which we and CB-USA were obligated to pay the
junior participants a closing fee of $18
000 on the effective date of the amendment to the Loan Agreement and are obligated to
pay a commitment fee of $18
000 on each anniversary of the effective date until the junior participants&rsquo; obligations are
terminated pursuant to the participation agreement. As of March 31
 2019
 we had borrowed $27.0 million of the $27.0 million
then available under the Credit Facility
 including $7.0 million of the $7.0 million available under the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
leaving no potential availability for working capital needs under the Credit Facility or for aged whiskey inventory purchases.

We
may borrow up to the maximum amount of the Credit Facility
 provided that we have a sufficient borrowing base (as defined in the
Loan Agreement). The Credit Facility interest rate (other than with respect to the Purchased Inventory Sublimit) is the rate that
when annualized
 is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 3.00%
 (b) the LIBOR Rate plus 5.50% and (c) 6.0%. The interest rate
applicable to the Purchased Inventory Sublimit is the rate
 that when annualized
 is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 4.25%
(b) the LIBOR Rate plus 6.75% and (c) 7.50%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears
 on the first day of every month on the average
daily unpaid principal amount of the Credit Facility. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any &ldquo;Default&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Event of Default&rdquo; (as defined under the Loan Agreement) we are required to pay interest at a rate that is 3.25%
per annum above the then applicable Credit Facility interest rate. The Loan Agreement contains EBITDA targets allowing for further
interest rate reductions in the future. The Credit Facility currently bears interest at 8.0% and the Purchased Inventory
Sublimit currently bears interest at 9.75%. We are required to pay down the principal balance of the Purchased Inventory
Sublimit within 15 banking days from the completion of a bottling run of bourbon from our bourbon inventory stock purchased with
funds borrowed under the Purchased Inventory Sublimit in an amount equal to the purchase price of such bourbon. The unpaid principal
balance of the Credit Facility
 all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
 and all fees
 costs and expenses payable in connection
with the Credit Facility
 are due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. In addition to closing fees
 ACF receives facility
fees and a collateral management fee (each as set forth in the Loan Agreement). Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured
by the grant of a pledge and a security interest in all of our assets. The Loan Amendment also contains a fixed charge coverage
ratio covenant requiring us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.1 to 1.0.

In
January 2017
 we acquired $1.0 million in aged bulk bourbon purchased under the Purchased Inventory Sublimit. Certain related
parties
 including Frost Gamma Investments Trust ($65

 Mark E. Andrews
 III ($33
350)
 Brian L. Heller
($28

 Mark E. Andrews
 III ($17
250)
 Brian L. Heller ($14

 were junior participants in the Purchased Inventory Sublimit with respect to such purchase.

The
Loan Agreement contains standard borrower representations and warranties for asset-based borrowing and a number of reporting obligations
and affirmative and negative covenants. The Loan Agreement includes negative covenants that
 among other things
 restrict our
ability to create additional indebtedness
 dispose of properties
 incur liens
 and make distributions or cash dividends. At March
31
 2019
 we were in compliance
 in all material respects
 with the covenants under the Loan Agreement.


    
    


In
March 2017
 we issued an 11% Subordinated Note due 2019
 dated March 29
 2017
 in the principal amount of $20.0 million with Frost
Nevada Investments Trust (the &ldquo;Subordinated Note&rdquo;)
 an entity affiliated with Phillip Frost
 M.D.
 a director and
a principal shareholder of ours. In April 2018
 we entered into a first amendment to the Subordinated Note to extend the maturity
date on the Subordinated Note from March 15
 2019 until September 15
 2020. No other provisions of the Subordinated Note were
amended. The purpose of the Subordinated Note was to finance the GCP Share Acquisition. The Subordinated Note
 as amended
 bears
interest quarterly at the rate of 11% per annum. The principal and interest accrued thereon is due and payable in full on September
15
 2020. All claims of the holder of the Subordinated Note to principal
 interest and any other amounts owed under the Subordinated
Note are subordinated in right of payment to all our indebtedness existing as of the date of the Subordinated Note. The Subordinated
Note contains customary events of default and may be prepaid by us
 in whole or in part
 without penalty
 at any time.

In
December 2009
 GCP issued a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $0.2 million to Gosling&rsquo;s Export (Bermuda)
Limited in exchange for credits issued on certain inventory purchases. This note matures on April 1
 2020
 is payable at maturity
subject to certain acceleration events
 and calls for annual interest of 5%
 to be accrued and paid at maturity.

We
have arranged various credit facilities aggregating &euro;0.3 million or $0.4 million (translated at the March 31
 2019 exchange
rate) with an Irish bank
 including overdraft coverage
 creditors&rsquo; insurance
 customs and excise guaranty and a revolving
credit facility. These facilities are payable on demand
 continue until terminated by either party
 are subject to annual review
and call for interest at the lender&rsquo;s AA1 Rate minus 1.70%. We have deposited &euro;0.3 million or $0.4 million (translated
at the March 31
 2019 exchange rate) with the bank to secure these borrowings.

In
October 2013
 we issued an aggregate principal amount of $2.1 million of unsecured 5% convertible subordinated notes (the &ldquo;Convertible
Notes&rdquo;). We used a portion of the proceeds to finance the acquisition of additional bourbon inventory in support of the
growth of our Jefferson&rsquo;s bourbon brand. The Convertible Notes matured on December 15
 2018. The Convertible Notes
 and
accrued but unpaid interest thereon
 were convertible into shares of our common stock
 par value $0.01 per share
 at a conversion
price of $0.90 per share. The Convertible Note purchasers included certain related parties of ours
 including an affiliate of
Dr. Phillip Frost ($500
000)
 Mark E. Andrews
 III ($50
000)
 an affiliate of Richard J. Lampen ($50
000) and Vector Group Ltd.
a more than 5% shareholder of ours
 of which Richard Lampen is an executive officer
 Henry Beinstein
 a director of ours
 is a
director and Phillip Frost
 M.D. is a principal shareholder ($200
000)
 all of whom converted the outstanding principal and interest
balances of their Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock in the year ended March 31
 2018.

In
the year ended March 31
 2018
 certain holders of the Convertible Notes
 including the related party holders described above
converted an aggregate $1
632
000 of the outstanding principal and interest balances of their Convertible Notes into 1
813
334
shares of our common stock
 pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes.

The
remaining Convertible Note of $50
000 matured and was repaid on December 15
 2018 in the normal course.



As
of March 31
 2019
 we had shareholders&rsquo; equity of $19.3 million as compared to $8.0 million at March 31
 2018. This
increase in shareholders&rsquo; equity was due to the exercise of stock options and stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million
partially offset by our $8.7 million total comprehensive income for the year ended March 31
 2019
 including
a $9.4 million tax benefit.

We
had working capital of $49.0 million at March 31
 2019 as compared to $38.6 million at March 31
 2018
 primarily due to a $10.2
million increase in inventory
 a $2.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $3.5 million increase
in accounts receivable
 which was partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

As
of March 31
 2019
 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.5 million
 as compared to $0.4 million as of March 31
2018. Changes in our cash and cash equivalents are primarily attributable to the net borrowings on our credit facilities to fund
our operations and working capital needs. At March 31
 2019 and 2018
 we also had approximately $0.4 million of cash restricted
from withdrawal and held by a bank in Ireland as collateral for overdraft coverage
 creditors&rsquo; insurance
 revolving credit
and other working capital purposes.

The
following may materially affect our liquidity over the near-to-mid term:

&#9679;
continued cash losses from operations;
&#9679;
our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing should it be required;
&#9679;
an increase in working capital requirements to finance higher levels of inventories and accounts receivable;
&#9679;
our ability to maintain and improve our relationships with our distributors and our routes to market;
&#9679;
our ability to procure raw materials at a favorable price to support our level of sales;
&#9679;
potential acquisitions of additional brands; and
&#9679;
expansion into new markets and within existing markets in the U.S. and internationally.

We
continue to implement sales and marketing initiatives that we expect will generate cash flows from operations in the next few
years. We seek to grow our business through expansion to new markets
 growth in existing markets and strengthened distributor
relationships. As our brands continue to grow
 our working capital requirements will increase. In particular
 the growth of our
Jefferson&rsquo;s brands requires a significant amount of working capital relative to our other brands
 as we are required to
purchase and hold ever increasing amounts of aged whiskey to meet growing demand. We must purchase and hold several years&rsquo;
worth of aged whiskey in inventory until such time as it is aged to our specific brand taste profiles
 increasing our working
capital requirements and negatively impacting cash flows.


    
    


We
may also seek additional brands and agency relationships to leverage our existing distribution platform. We intend to finance
any such brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources
 borrowings and
 in appropriate circumstances
additional issuances of equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial
position
 could materially reduce our liquidity and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating
results. We continue to control expenses
 seek improvements in routes to market and contain production costs to improve cash flows.

We
are currently negotiating the restructuring of all or a portion of our debt
 including the Subordinated Note.
This restructuring may consist of a combination of expanding and extending the Loan Agreement and Credit Facility with ACF
 extending
the term of the Subordinated Note
 converting some or all of the debt to equity or paying down the debt with funds that may be
raised from future equity offerings
 although there is no assurance that we will be successful in such restructuring. If we are
unable to restructure or refinance our debt
 or are unable to raise equity on terms that are acceptable to us
 it could have a
significant effect on our financial position
 could materially reduce our liquidity and could cause substantial fluctuations in
our quarterly and yearly operating results.


As
of March 31
 2019
 we had borrowed $27.0 million of the $27.0 million then available under the Credit Facility
 including $7.0
million of the $7.0 million available under the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 leaving no potential availability for working capital
needs under the Credit Facility or for aged whiskey inventory purchases. As of June 12
 2019
 we had repaid $2.5 million
of the $27.0 million borrowed at March 31
 2019. As of June 14
 2019
 we had borrowed $24.5 million of the $27.0 million then
available under the amended Credit Facility
 including $7.0 million of the $7.0 million available under the Purchased Inventory
Sublimit
 leaving $2.5 million in potential availability for working capital needs under the amended Credit Facility and $0.0
million available for aged whiskey inventory purchases. We believe our current cash and working capital and the availability under
the Credit Facility will enable us to fund our losses until we achieve profitability
 ensure continuity of supply of our brands
and support new brand initiatives and marketing programs through at least June 2020. We believe we can continue to meet our operating
needs through additional mechanisms
 if necessary
 including additional or expanded debt financings
 potential equity offerings
and limiting or adjusting the timing of additional inventory purchases based on available resources
 although we continue to
evaluate alternative financing options.

Operating
A substantial portion of available cash has been used to fund our operating activities. In general
 these
cash funding requirements are based on the costs in maintaining our distribution system
 our sales and marketing activities and
cash required to fund the purchase of our inventories. In general
 these cash outlays for inventories are only partially offset
by increases in our accounts payable to our suppliers.

On
average
 the production cycle for our owned brands is up to three months from the time we obtain the distilled spirits and other
materials needed to bottle and package our products to the time we receive products available for sale
 in part due to the international
nature of our business. We do not produce Goslings rums or ginger beer
 Pallini liqueurs
 Arran Scotch whiskeys or Gozio amaretto.
Instead
 we receive the finished product directly from the owners of such brands. From the time we have products available for
sale
 an additional two to three months may be required before we sell our inventory and collect payment from customers. Further
our inventory at March 31
 2019 included significant additional stores of aged bourbon purchased in advance of forecasted production
requirements. In October 2017
 we entered into a supply agreement with a bourbon distiller
 which provides for the production
of newly-distilled bourbon whiskey. Under this agreement
 the distiller will provide us with an agreed upon amount of original
proof gallons of newly-distilled bourbon whiskey
 subject to certain annual adjustments. For the contract year ending December
31
 2018
 we contracted to purchase approximately $3.9 million in newly distilled bourbon
 all of which had been purchased as
of December 31
 2018. For the contract year ending December 31
 2019
 we contracted to purchase approximately $4.6 million in
newly distilled bourbon
 of which $1.2 million had been purchased as of March 31
 2019. We are not obligated to pay the distiller
for any product not yet received. We expect to use the aged bourbon in the normal course of future sales
 generating positive
cash flows in future periods.

During
the year ended March 31
 2019
 net cash used in operating activities was $8.5 million
 consisting primarily of a $10.2 million
increase in inventory
 a $3.5 million increase in accounts receivable
 a $2.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current
assets and a net loss of $0.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in accounts payable
and accrued expenses
 stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $0.6 million.

During
the year ended March 31
 2018
 net cash used in operating activities was $5.6 million
 consisting primarily of a $5.8 million
increase in inventory
 a $2.1 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $1.7 million increase in accounts
receivable. These uses of cash were partially offset by $0.5 million in net income
 a $0.6 million increase in due to related
parties
 stock based compensation expense of $2.0 million
 and depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million.

During
the year ended March 31
 2017
 net cash used in operating activities was $1.7 million
 consisting primarily of a $4.3 million
increase in inventory
 a $2.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and a $1.2 million increase in accounts receivable. These uses
of cash were partially offset by $0.5 million in net income
 a $2.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses
stock based compensation expense of $1.6 million
 a $0.8 million increase in due to related parties and depreciation and amortization
expense of $1.0 million.

Interest
payments are based on current interest rates at March 31
 2019. Debt principal and debt interest represent principal and interest
to be paid on our revolving credit facility based on the balance outstanding as of March 31
 2019. Interest on the revolving credit
facility is calculated using the prevailing rates as of March 31
 2019. Our estimate assumes that we will maintain the same levels
of indebtedness and financial performance through the credit facility&rsquo;s maturity in July 2020.



    
Long-term

Currency
Translation

The
functional currencies for our foreign operations are the Euro in Ireland and the British Pound in the United Kingdom. With respect
to our consolidated financial statements
 the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed
for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using
a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income.

Where
in this annual report we refer to amounts in Euros or British Pounds
 we have for your convenience also in certain cases provided
a conversion of those amounts to U.S. Dollars in parentheses. Where the numbers refer to a specific balance sheet account date
or financial statement account period
 we have used the exchange rate that was used to perform the conversions in connection with
the applicable financial statement. In all other instances
 unless otherwise indicated
 the conversions have been made using the
exchange rates as of March 31
 2019
 each as calculated from the Interbank exchange rates as reported by Oanda.com. On March 31
2019
 the exchange rate of the Euro and the British Pound in exchange for U.S. Dollars was &euro;1.00 = U.S. $1.12171 (equivalent
to U.S.$1.00 = &euro;0.89150) and &pound;1.00 = U.S. $1.30234 (equivalent to U.S.$1.00 = &pound;0.76785).


    
    


These
conversions should not be construed as representations that the Euro and British Pound amounts actually represent U.S. Dollar
amounts or could be converted into U.S. Dollars at the rates indicated.

Impact
of inflation

We
believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate. Inflation and changing
prices did not have a material impact on our operations during fiscal 2019
 2018 or 2017. Severe increases in inflation
 however
could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business
 financial condition and results of
operations.

Recent
accounting pronouncements

We
discuss recently issued and adopted accounting standards in the &ldquo;Accounting standards adopted&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recent accounting
pronouncements&rdquo; sections of note 1 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This
annual report includes certain &ldquo;forward-looking statements&rdquo; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements
 which involve risks and uncertainties
 relate to the discussion of our business strategies
and our expectations concerning future operations
 margins
 profitability
 liquidity and capital resources and to analyses and
other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. We use words such
as &ldquo;may&rdquo;
 &ldquo;will&rdquo;
 &ldquo;should&rdquo;
 &ldquo;expects&rdquo;
 &ldquo;intends&rdquo;
 &ldquo;plans&rdquo;
&ldquo;anticipates&rdquo;

 &ldquo;seeks&rdquo;
 &ldquo;predicts&rdquo;
 &ldquo;could&rdquo;
&ldquo;projects&rdquo;
 &ldquo;potential&rdquo; and similar terms and phrases
 including references to assumptions
 in this report
to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning
future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties
 risks and factors relating to our operations and business environments
all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control
 that could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and other factors include
those listed under &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; and as follows:



    
our
    history of losses;

    
our
    significant level of indebtedness;

    
worldwide
    and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions could adversely impact our financial performance;

    
our
    potential need for additional capital
 which
 if not available on acceptable terms or at all
 could restrict our future growth
    and severely limit our operations;

    
our
    dependence on a limited number of suppliers
 who may not perform satisfactorily or may end their relationships with us
 which
    could result in lost sales
 incurrence of additional costs or lost credibility in the marketplace;

    
our
    annual purchase obligations with certain suppliers;

    
the
    failure of even a few of our independent wholesale distributors to adequately distribute our products within their territories
    could harm our sales and result in a decline in our results of operations;

    
our
    need to maintain a relatively large inventory of our products to support customer delivery requirements
 which could negatively
    impact our operations if such inventory is lost due to theft
 fire or other damage;

    
our
    brands could fail to achieve more widespread consumer acceptance
 which may limit our growth;

    
the
    potential limitation to our growth if we are unable to successfully acquire additional brands
 and even if additional brands
    are acquired
 such acquisitions may have a negative impact on our results of operations;

    
currency
    exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations may significantly adversely affect our revenues
 sales
 costs of goods and overall
    financial results;

    
In
    the past
 we have
    identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
 and our business and stock price may be adversely
    affected if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting;

    
a
    failure of one or more of our key IT systems
 networks
 processes
 associated sites or service providers could have a material
    adverse impact on our business;

    
the
    possibility that we or our strategic partners will fail to protect our respective trademarks and trade secrets
 which could
    compromise our competitive position and decrease the value of our brand portfolio;

    
our
    failure to attract or retain key executive or employee talent could adversely impact our business;

    
the
    possibility that we cannot secure and maintain listings in control states
 which could cause the sales of our products to
    decrease significantly;

    
an
    impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or other acquired intangible assets could negatively affect our operating
    results and shareholders&rsquo; equity;

    
changes
    in consumer preferences and trends could adversely affect demand for our products;

    
our
    business performance is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of rum
 whiskey and ginger beer sales;

    
there
    is substantial competition in our industry and the many factors that may prevent us from competing successfully;

    
adverse
    changes in public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products;

    
class
    action or other litigation relating to alcohol misuse or abuse could adversely affect our business; and

    
adverse
    regulatory decisions and legal
 regulatory or tax changes could limit our business activities
 increase our operating costs
    and reduce our margins.




    
    


We
assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason
 or to update the reasons actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in
 or implied by
 these forward-looking statements
 even if new information
becomes available in the future.

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market
risk

We
are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices
 including movements in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
In the future
 we may enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates
 although we do not currently have any such instruments in place. The following is additional information
about the market risks we are exposed to and how we manage these risks:

Interest
rate risk

Interest
on our Credit Facility (other than with respect to the Purchased Inventory Sublimit) is charged at the rate that
 when annualized
is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 3.00%
 (b) the LIBOR Rate plus 5.50% and (c) 6.00%. The interest rate applicable to
the Purchased Inventory Sublimit is the rate that
 when annualized
 is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 4.25%
 (b) the
LIBOR Rate plus 6.75% and (c) 7.50%. As of March 31
 2019
 we had $27.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility
 including
$7.0 million under the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 none of which is currently being hedged. Interest on our foreign revolving
credit facilities is charged at the lender&rsquo;s AA1 Rate minus 1.70%. As of March 31
 2019
 we had $0.1 million outstanding
under our foreign revolving credit facilities.

A
hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) increase in the interest rate being charged on the $27.0 million of unhedged
debt outstanding under our Credit Facility
 including the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 and our foreign revolving credit facilities
at March 31
 2019 would have an impact of approximately $228
229 on our interest expense for the year.

Foreign
exchange rate risk

The
majority of our sales
 net and expenses are transacted in U.S. dollars. However
 in the year ended March 31
 2019
 Euro denominated
sales accounted for approximately 5.1% of our sales
 net. We also incur expenses in foreign currencies
 primarily the Euro. In
the year ended March 31
 2019
 Euro denominated expenses accounted for approximately 6.1% of our expenses. A substantial change
in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the Euro could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Euro and British pound would have had an impact of
approximately $563
793 on our income from operations for the year ended March 31
 2019.

If
we do not enter into hedging arrangements
 the more we expand our business outside the United States
 the more our financial results
will be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. In the past
 we have entered into forward contracts from time to time to reduce
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We recognize derivative contracts in the balance sheet at fair value
 and reflect
any net gains and losses currently in earnings. At March 31
 2019 and 2018
 we had no forward contracts outstanding. Gain or loss
on foreign currency forward contracts
 which was de minimis during the periods presented
 is included in other income and expense.

The
functional currencies for our foreign operations are the Euro in Ireland and the British Pound in the United Kingdom. With respect
to our consolidated financial statements
 the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed
for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using
a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income. The effect of foreign currency translation was a loss of ($125
007) for the year ended March 31
 2019
 income
of $226
661 for the year ended March 31
 2018 and a loss of ($114
878) for the year ended March 31
 2017. A hypothetical 10% change
in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Euro and British pound would have had an impact of approximately $230
000 for
the year ended March 31
 2019 as a result of foreign currency translation.

Commodity
price risk

We
currently are not exposed to commodity price risks. We do not purchase the basic ingredients such as grain
 sugar cane or agave
that are converted into alcohol through distillation. Instead
 we have relationships with various companies to provide distillation
bottling or other production services for us. These relationships vary on a brand-by-brand basis.

As
of March 31
 2019
 we did not have any hedging arrangements in place to protect our exposure to commodity price fluctuations.

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Castle
Brands Inc.


Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Castle Brands Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of March 31
 2019
and 2018
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 comprehensive income
 stockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31
 2019
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial
statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the consolidated financial
position of the Company as of March 31
 2019
 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended March 31
 2019
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

We
also have audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;)
the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31
 2019
 based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;)
and our report dated June 14
 2019
 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a
test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                                         and marketing programs through at least June 2020. The Company believes it can continue
                                         to meet its operating needs through additional mechanisms
 if necessary
 including additional
                                         or expanded debt financings

                                         of earnings and projected future taxable income
 the Company concluded as of March 31
                                         2019 that certain of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be realizable on a more-likely-than-not
                                         basis. As a result
 the Company&rsquo;s valuation allowance decreased by $9
607
000 during
                                         fiscal 2019.

                                         is currently negotiating the restructuring of all or a portion of the debt
 including the Subordinated
                                         Note. This restructuring may consist of a combination of expanding and extending the

 extending the term of the Subordinated Note
 or other methods of paying
                                         down the debt
 although there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in
                                         such restructuring.

-
                                         The Company operates in one reportable segment and derives substantially all of its revenue
                                         from the sale and delivery of premium beverage alcohol and related non-beverage alcohol
                                         products. In the U.S.
 the Company is required by law to use state-licensed distributors
                                         or
 in the control states
 state-owned agencies performing this function
 to sell its
                                         brands to retail outlets. In its international markets
 the Company relies primarily
                                         on established spirits distributors in much the same way as in the U.S. Revenue from
                                         product sales is recognized when the product is shipped to a customer (generally a distributor)
                                         and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of
                                         sale and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is not recognized on shipments to
                                         control states in the United States until such time as product is sold through to the
                                         retail channel.
        
The
        Company does not ship product unless it has received an order or other documentation authorizing delivery to its customers.
        Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods.
        The Company generally does not provide post-delivery services and does not offer a right-of-return except in the case
        of an error. Uncollectable accounts receivable are estimated by using a combination of historical customer experience
        and a customer-by-customer analysis. The Company&rsquo;s payment terms vary by customer and
 in certain cases
 the products
        offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company
        has elected not to assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception
        is such that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods to the customer will be
        one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining
        a contract as an expense when incurred as the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized
        will be one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to exclude from the measurement of the
        transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific
        revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from a customer
 i.e excise taxes (see note 1N). As
        permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to account for any shipping and handling activities that occur after
        a customer obtains control of any goods as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods
 and the Company is
        not required to evaluate whether such shipping and handling activities are promised services to its customers.




    
    




    
Inventories
    
 dry good raw materials (bottles
 labels
 corks and caps)
 packaging
    finished goods
 excise taxes and freight and are valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the weighted average cost method.
    The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete
    or in excess of the Company&rsquo;s forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net
    realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including
 but not limited to
 historical usage
 expected
    future demand and market requirements. A change to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold. See
    Note 3.


During
the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for obsolete and slow-moving inventory
of $545
500
 $376
611 and $240
000
 respectively. The Company recorded these allowances and write-offs on both raw materials
and finished goods
 primarily in connection with spoilage and slow-moving inventory
 label and packaging changes made to certain
brands
 as well as adjustments to estimated freight costs and excise taxes and certain cost variances. The charges have been recorded
as increases to Cost of Sales in the respective years.



    
Equipment
    
 computers and software and furniture and fixtures. When assets are retired or
    otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related depreciation is removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is recognized
    in the statement of operations. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
    the assets ranging from three to five years.

    
    

    
Goodwill
    and other intangible assets
    assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible
    assets with indefinite lives are not amortized
 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances
    indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective
    estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis
 and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.


Under
Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 350
 &ldquo;Intangibles
- Goodwill and Other&rdquo;
 impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable
reporting units with the carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors
to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step
impairment test shall be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results.
Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates
that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth
 cost of sales
 selling and marketing
expenses and discount rates. Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&rsquo;s
net assets exceeds the unit&rsquo;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying
amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount
of goodwill recognized in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid.
Rights
 trademarks
 trade names and formulations are indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization and are tested
for impairment at least annually. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset group allocated
to each reporting unit with its allocated carrying amount.

Under
the goodwill qualitative assessment at March 31
 2019 and 2018
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated
fair value of each reporting unit were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&rsquo; impairment testing results
budget to actual results
 Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based
on this assessment
 the Company determined that no quantitative assessment was required.



    
Impairment
    and disposal of long-lived assets
 &ldquo;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&rdquo;
    the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its
    definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the
    asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments recorded during the
    years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017.





    
    





    
Shipping
    and handling
    purchase of raw materials and finished goods. These costs are charged to cost of sales at the time the underlying product
    is sold. The Company also incurs shipping costs in connection with its various marketing activities
 including the shipment
    of point of sale materials to the Company&rsquo;s regional sales managers and customers
 and the costs of shipping product
    in connection with its various marketing programs and promotions. These shipping charges are included in selling expense and
    were $3
261
889
 $2
797
701 and $2
347
121 for the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

    
    

    
Excise
    taxes and duty
    paid after finished goods are imported into the United States or other relevant jurisdiction and then transferred out of &ldquo;bond.&rdquo;
    Excise taxes and duty are recorded to inventory as a component of the cost of the underlying finished goods. When the underlying
    products are sold &ldquo;ex warehouse&rdquo;
 the sales price reflects the taxes paid and the inventoried excise taxes and
    duties are charged to cost of sales.

    
    

    
Distributor
    charges and promotional goods
    rendered by the distributor
 including product depletions
 product samples for various promotional purposes
 in-store tastings
    and training where legal
 and local advertising where legal. Such charges are reflected as selling expense as incurred. Also
    the Company has entered into arrangements with certain of its distributors whereby the purchase of a particular product or
    products by a distributor is accompanied by a percentage of the sale being composed of promotional goods or as a predetermined
    discount percentage of dollars off invoice. In such cases
 the cost of the promotional goods is charged to cost of sales and
    dollars off invoice are a reduction to revenue.




    
Foreign
    currency
    in the United Kingdom. Under ASC 830
 &ldquo;Foreign Currency Matters&rdquo;
 the translation from the applicable foreign
    currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date
    and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments
    are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
    shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations.

    
    

    
Fair
    value of financial instruments
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments&rdquo;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument
    as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure
    of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The Company believes that there is no material difference between the
    fair-value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the Company&rsquo;s balance sheets due to the short-term maturity
    of these instruments
 or with respect to the Company&rsquo;s debt
 as compared to the current borrowing rates available to
    the Company.


The
Company&rsquo;s investments are reported at fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance
 which accomplishes the following
key objectives:



    
    

Defines
    fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date;

    
    

Establishes
    a three-level hierarchy (&ldquo;valuation hierarchy&rdquo;) for fair value measurements;

    
    

Requires
    consideration of the Company&rsquo;s creditworthiness when valuing liabilities; and

    
    

Expands
    disclosures about instruments measured at fair value.


The
valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
A financial instrument&rsquo;s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are as follows:



    
    
Level
    1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

    
    
Level
    2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and inputs
    that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

    
    

Level
    3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.




    
Income
                                         taxes
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &ldquo;2017 Tax Act&rdquo;)
                                         was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws
                                         that impact the Company
 most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate
                                         from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31
 2017. The Company recognized
                                         the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in its financial statements in accordance
                                         with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118
 which provides SEC staff guidance for the application
                                         of ASC Topic 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo;
 (&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;) in the reporting
                                         period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The Company completed its assessment
                                         of income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act during fiscal year ended March 31
 2019. The
                                         Company made a policy election to treat the income tax due on U.S. inclusion of the new
                                         GILTI provisions as a period expense when incurred.
        
The
        2017 Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% for all corporations effective January 1
        2018. For fiscal year companies
 the change in law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the
        fiscal year
 which in the Company&rsquo;s case is 30.79% for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. Thereafter
 the applicable
        statutory rate is 21.0%.
        
Under
        ASC 740
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
        between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A
        valuation allowance is provided to the extent a deferred tax asset is not considered recoverable.
        
The
        Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10 and as of March 31
 2019
 the Company had reserves for uncertain tax
        positions (including related interest and penalties) for various state and local taxes of $43
816. The Company recognizes
        interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in general and administrative expense.

Use
    of estimates 
    (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates
    include the accounting for items such as evaluating annual impairment tests
 derivative instruments and equity issuances
    warrant valuation
 stock-based compensation
 allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 amortization
    and expense accruals.

 &ldquo;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based
Payment Accounting.&rdquo; This ASU expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payments to non-employees for goods
or services. This ASU also clarifies that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing
to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted
for under Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2019
 with
early adoption permitted. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the
Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


    
    



In
June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments. This ASU amends the requirement on the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets
held. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption is permitted
 but not earlier than annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2018. This amendment
should be applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning
of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance
will have on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (&ldquo;ASU 2016-02&rdquo;)
 which provides guidance for accounting for leases.
ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases and to record a right-of-use asset and a
lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of the lease classification. The lease classification
will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest rate method or on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease. For leases with a term of 12 months or less for which there is not an option to purchase the underlying
asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class
of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and should recognize lease expense for such leases generally
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures will
be required so that users are able to understand more about the nature of an entity&rsquo;s leasing activities. Accounting for
lessors remains largely unchanged from current U.S. GAAP. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-10
 Codification Improvements
to Topic 842
 Leases and ASU 2018-11 &ldquo;Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements&rdquo; (ASU 2018-11). ASU 2018-10 clarifies
certain areas within ASU 2016-02. Prior to ASU 2018-11
 a modified retrospective transition was required for financing or operating
leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
ASU 2018-11 allows entities an additional transition method to the existing requirements whereby an entity could adopt the provisions
of ASU 2016-02 by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption
without adjustment to the financial statements for periods prior to adoption. ASU 2018-11 also allows a practical expedient that
permits lessors to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component if certain conditions are present. An
entity that elects to use the practical expedients will
 in effect
 continue to account for leases that commenced before the effective
date in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is modified
 except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use
asset and a lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum
rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02
 ASU 2018-10 and ASU 2018-11 will be effective
for the Company&rsquo;s fiscal year beginning April 1
 2019 and subsequent interim periods.

The
Company plans to employ the available practical expedients consistently to all of its office and office equipment leases
 supply
and warehousing agreements determined to be subject to the standard. The expedients grant the Company the ability to forgo reassessing
lease classifications and whether any expired or existing contracts are
 or contain
 leases. The Company plans to follow the guidance
of ASU 2018-11 and will not recast its comparative periods. The comparative periods will follow the guidance of ASC 840
 while
the current period will follow the guidance of the new ASC 842. As needed
 the periods will be bridged by a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of April 1
 2019.

The
Company will elect to utilize the transition package of practical expedients permitted within the new standard
 which among other
things
 allows the Company to carryforward the historical lease classification. The Company will make an accounting policy election
that will exclude leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from its Consolidated Balance Sheets and will recognize those
lease payments in its Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

On
adoption the Company currently expects to recognize right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities ranging from $425
000 to
$450
000 on its Consolidated Balance Sheet for its operating leases with terms greater than 12 months. The Company does not expect
a material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations
 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income
 or its Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. The new standard will not have a material impact on liquidity and will not have an impact on the Company&rsquo;s
debt-covenant compliance under its current debt agreements. These expectations may change as the Company&rsquo;s assessment is
finalized.

The
Company is in the process of evaluating changes to its business processes
 systems and controls needed to support recognition
and disclosure under the new standard. Further
 the Company is continuing to assess any incremental disclosures that will be required
in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.

The
Company&rsquo;s current lease arrangements have terms that expire through 2021.

The
Company does not believe that any other recently issued
 but not yet effective
 accounting standards
 if currently adopted
 would
have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.


Accounting
                                         standards adopted
 FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02
 Income Statement
                                         - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects
                                         from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&ldquo;ASU 2018-02&rdquo;)
 which allows
                                         for stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the
                                         2017 Tax Act to be reclassified to retained earnings. This guidance became effective
                                         for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the adoption of this
                                         guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
                                         cash flows and financial condition.


    
    



In
May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
 &ldquo;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.&rdquo;
ASU 2017-09 provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity
to apply modification accounting. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
condition.

In
January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01
 &ldquo;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&rdquo;
This ASU
 which must be applied prospectively
 provides a narrower framework to be used to determine if a set of assets and activities
constitutes a business than under current guidance and is generally expected to result in greater consistency in the application
of ASC Topic 805
 Business Combinations. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined
that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and
financial condition.

In
November 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18
 &ldquo;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
 a consensus of the
FASB&rsquo;s Emerging Issues Task Force (the &ldquo;Task Force&rdquo;).&rdquo; The new standard requires that the statement of
cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted
cash or restricted cash equivalents. Entities will also be required to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and
disclose the nature of the restrictions. The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018 using a retrospective adoption
method
 which resulted in an adjustment to &ldquo;Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash&rdquo; on the accompanying
consolidated statement of cashflows. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect
on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

In
October 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-16
 &ldquo;Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.&rdquo;
This ASU removes the prohibition against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity
transfers of assets other than inventory. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. Entities must apply
a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of
adoption. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s results
of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

In
August 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15
 &ldquo;Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments&rdquo;
 which provides guidance on eight cash flow classification issues with the objective of reducing differences in
practice. The new standard became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. Adoption is required to be on a retrospective
basis
 unless impracticable for any of the amendments
 in which case a prospective application is permitted. The Company determined
that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and
financial condition.

In
March 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-08
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (&ldquo;ASU 2016-08&rdquo;). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance
stated in ASU 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&ldquo;ASU 2014-9&rdquo;)
 instead
 the amendments
in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent
considerations and whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and
transition requirements as the new standard issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new standard
outlines a new
 single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers
and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new standard contains principles
to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions
to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control
of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. In addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted the new standard on April
1
 2018 by applying the modified retrospective method
 which did not result in a transition adjustment nor an adjustment to opening
retained earnings. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s
results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

In
January 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities&rdquo;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement
of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities
under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Also
 the ASU clarifies
guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on
available-for-sale debt securities. The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018
 which did not result in a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the balance sheet. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the
Company&rsquo;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.

Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding
during the period that are not anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon exercise
of stock options
 vesting of restricted shares or conversion of convertible notes outstanding. In computing diluted net income
per share for the years ended March 31
 2018 and 2017
 no adjustment has been made to the weighted average outstanding common
shares for the assumed exercise of stock options
 vesting of restricted shares or conversion of convertible notes as the assumed

                                         August 2011
 the Company and CB-USA entered into a loan and security agreement (as amended
                                         and restated
 and further amended
 the &ldquo;Amended Agreement&rdquo;) with a third-party
                                         lender ACF FinCo I LP (&ldquo;ACF
&rdquo;) as successor in interest
 which
 as amended
                                         provided for availability (subject to certain terms and conditions) of a facility of
                                         up to $21.0 million (the &ldquo;Credit Facility&rdquo;) for the purpose of providing
                                         the Company with working capital
 including a sublimit in the maximum principal amount
                                         of $7
000
000 to permit the Company to acquire aged whiskey inventory (the &ldquo;Purchased
                                         Inventory Sublimit&rdquo;)
 subject to certain conditions set forth in the Amended
                                         Agreement. The Company and CB-USA are referred to individually and collectively as the
                                         Borrower. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement Amendment
 the Company and CB-USA may borrow
                                         up to the lesser of (x) $21
000
000 and (y) the sum of the borrowing base calculated
                                         in accordance with the Amended Agreement and the Purchased Inventory Sublimit.

In
May 2018
 the Company and CB-USA entered into a Fourth Amendment (the &ldquo;Fourth Amendment&rdquo;) to the Amended Agreement
to amend certain terms of the Credit Facility. Among other changes
 the Fourth Amendment increased the maximum amount of the Credit
Facility from $21
000
000 to $23
000
000 and amended the definition of borrowing base to increase the amount of borrowing that
can be collateralized by inventory.

The
Credit Facility interest rate is the rate that
 when annualized
 is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 3.00%
 (b) the LIBOR
Rate plus 5.50% and (c) 6.00%. As of March 31
 2019
 the Credit Facility interest rate was 8.0%.

The
Purchased Inventory Sublimit interest rate is the rate that
 when annualized
 is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate plus 4.25%
(b) the LIBOR Rate plus 6.75% and (c) 7.50%. As of March 31
 2019
 the interest rate applicable to the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
was 9.75%. The monthly facility fee is 0.75% per annum of the maximum Credit Facility. Also
 the Company must pay a monthly facility
fee of $2
000 with respect to the Purchased Inventory Sublimit until all obligations with respect thereof are fully paid and performed.

The
Amended Agreement contains EBITDA targets allowing for further interest rate reductions in the future. The Company and CB-USA
are permitted to prepay the Credit Facility in whole or the Purchased Inventory Sublimit
 in whole or in part
 subject to certain
prepayment penalties as set forth in the Loan Agreement Amendment.

 the Borrower is required to pay interest at a rate that is 3.25% per annum above the then applicable Credit
Facility interest rate. There have been no Events of Default under the Credit Facility. ACF also receives a collateral management
fee of $1

to the facility fee with respect to the Purchased Inventory Sublimit. The Amended Agreement contains standard borrower representations
and warranties for asset-based borrowing and a number of reporting obligations and affirmative and negative covenants. The Amended
Agreement includes negative covenants that
 among other things
 restrict the Borrower&rsquo;s ability to create additional indebtedness
dispose of properties
 incur liens and make distributions or cash dividends. The obligations of the Borrower under the Amended
Amendment are secured by the grant of a pledge and security interest in all of the assets of the Borrower. At March 31

the Company was in compliance
 in all respects
 with the covenants under the Amended Agreement. The Credit Facility matures on

NOTE
10 - 

The
Company enters into forward contracts from time to time to reduce its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company recognizes
in the balance sheet derivative contracts at fair value
 and reflects any net gains and losses currently in earnings. At March
31

 the Company had no forward contracts outstanding. Gain or loss on foreign currency forward contracts
 which
was de minimis during the periods presented
 is included in other income and expense.

NOTE
11 - 

The
Company accounts for taxes in accordance with ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo;
 which requires the recognition of tax benefits
or expense on the temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences
are expected to be recovered or settled.

The
Company&rsquo;s income tax (benefit) expense for the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017 consists primarily of federal and
state and local taxes. Effective with the acquisition of the additional 20.1% of GCP as described in Note 4
 GCP became part
of the U.S. federal consolidated income tax group beginning in the year-ended March 31

In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net
operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. The Company considers the level of historical taxable income
 scheduled
reversal of temporary differences
 tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in determining whether a
valuation allowance is warranted. Based on historical taxable income and
projected future taxable income
 the Company concluded as of March 31
 2019 that certain of its U.S. deferred tax assets are
realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on Section 163(j) deferred interest
carryforwards and a partial valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses. The Company&rsquo;s valuation
allowance decreased by $9
607
000 during fiscal 2019 as certain of the U.S. deferred tax assets became realizable on a
more-likely-than-not basis as of March 31
 2019.


    
    


In
accordance with ASC 350-10
 the Company does not amortize indefinite lived-intangible assets for financial reporting purposes.
The company recorded a deferred tax liability of $514
000 related to the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting
and tax basis of intangible assets related to its Ireland operations.

As
of March 31
 2019
 the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $76
683
000 of which
$36
088
000 expire in fiscal 2025 through 2036
 if not utilized. The remaining $40
595
000 of the U.S. federal net operating
loss carryforwards are subject to a significant annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and are
expected to expire unutilized. The Company has reduced the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance for the net
operating losses which are expected to expire unutilized in the deferred tax asset and liability table above for the fiscal years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018. The Company
also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13
366
000
 which have an indefinite
life.

As
of March 31
 2019
 the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and foreign withholding taxes on any excess of financial reporting
over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries
 as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested overseas. If these future
earnings are repatriated to the U.S.
 or if the Company determines that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future
the Company may be required to accrue U.S. deferred taxes (if any) and applicable withholding taxes. It is not practicable to
estimate the tax impact of the reversal of the outside basis difference
 or the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of
its hypothetical calculation.

A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits
 excluding interest and penalties
 is as follows:

Of
the unrecognized tax benefits reflected above at March 31
 2019
 the entire amount would reduce the Company&rsquo;s
effective tax rate if recognized. The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters in
general and administrative expenses. For the year ended March 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company recognized an expense related
to interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $2
000 and $1
000
 respectively. For the year ended March 31
 2019
and 2018
 the Company&rsquo;s accrual for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is $3
000 and $1
000
respectively. The Company does not believe that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or
decrease within the next 12 months.

Tax
years 2015 through 2019 remain open to examination by federal and state tax jurisdictions. The Company has various foreign subsidiaries
for which tax years 2013 through 2019 remain open to examination in certain foreign tax jurisdictions.

Weighted

The
fair value of each option award under the 2003 and 2013 Plans was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The use of an option pricing model
also requires the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility
 risk-free interest rate
 expected dividends
and expected term. Expected volatility is based on the Company&rsquo;s historical volatility and the volatility of a peer group
of companies over the expected life of the option. The expected term and vesting of the options represents the estimated period
of time until exercise. The expected term was determined using the simplified method available under current guidance. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option. The
Company has not paid dividends on its common stock in the past and does not plan to pay any dividends on its common stock in the
near future. Current authoritative guidance also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise
these estimates
 if necessary
 in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company estimates
forfeitures based on its expectation of future experience while considering its historical experience.

The
fair value of options at grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model utilizing the following weighted
average assumptions:

against the ASC 842 criteria and determined:



    
    
The Company currently occupies office
    space in New York
 NY
 Houston
 TX
 and Dublin
 Ireland. The Company has assessed the terms and conditions of the current
    rent agreements against the ASC 842 criteria and determined that all three locations are classified as operating leases.

    
    
    

    
    
The Company currently leases copier
    equipment at its New York
 NY (two copiers) and Dublin
 Ireland (one copier) offices. The Company has assessed the terms and
    conditions of the current lease agreements against the ASC 842 criteria and determined that all three copiers are classified
    as financing leases.

    
    
    

    
    
The Company currently has a number
    of supply and warehousing agreements which required evaluation in order to determine the presence of any embedded leases.
    The Company has assessed the terms and conditions of the current agreements against the ASC 842 criteria and has determined
    that none of the agreements are considered to be leases.







    
The
    Company has evaluated its leases to determine the appropriate discount rate(s) that apply to each of the contracts that fall
    under the guidance of the new standard. As the Company is unable to determine the fair value of its leased office space and
    leased office equipment described above
 the Company will use their incremental borrowing rate of 8.0% to discount these leases.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures

(a)


The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
 in
the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&rsquo;s management
 including its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

In
connection with the preparation of this Form 10-K
 the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision of and with the
participation of the Company&rsquo;s management
 including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 as of March
31
 2019
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures
 as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation
 the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of March 31
 2019
 the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of March 31
 2019.

(b)


The
Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management
 including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control &mdash; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management
and to the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:



    
    
pertain
    to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of Company assets;

    
    
    

    
    
provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
    of management and directors; and

    
    
    

    
    
provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of Company assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


In
connection with this annual report on Form 10-K
 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated
 with the participation
of our management
 the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on management&rsquo;s evaluation
 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer each concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31
 2019.

EisnerAmper
LLP
 an independent registered public accounting firm
 has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness
of internal controls over financial reporting as of March 31
 2019 as stated in its report which is included herein.

(c)


There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 that occurred during the quarter ended March 31
2019 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 stockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year

The
Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
 included in the accompanying Management&rsquo;s Annual Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition
and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

An
entity&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. An entity&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the entity; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the
entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the entity&rsquo;s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

DESCRIPTION
OF CASTLE BRANDS INC.&rsquo;s SECURITIES

The
following summarizes certain material terms and provisions of our capital stock. It does not purport to be complete
 however
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Florida law and by the actual terms and provisions contained in our articles
of incorporation
 as amended
 and bylaws.

Overview
- Authorized and Outstanding Shares

As
of June 14
 2019
 under our articles of incorporation
 as amended
 we had the authority to issue:



    
    
300
000
000
    shares of common stock
 par value $0.01 per share; and

    
    
    

    
    
25
000
000
    shares of preferred stock
 par value $0.01 per share
 which are issuable in series on terms determined by our Board of Directors.


The
following descriptions set forth certain general terms and provisions of our common stock and preferred stock.

Rights
of Our Common Stock

Preemptive
Rights
of ours.

Voting
Rights

.
Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends or other distributions when and if declared by our Board of Directors.
The right of our Board of Directors to declare dividends
 however
 is subject to any rights of the holders of other classes of
our capital stock and the availability of sufficient funds under Florida law to pay dividends.

Liquidation
Rights
 subject to the rights
 if any
 of the holders of other classes of
our capital stock
 the holders of our common stock are entitled to receive any of our assets available for distribution to our
shareholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by them.

.
We list our common stock on the NYSE American under the symbol &ldquo;ROX.&rdquo;

Additionally
please see &ldquo;Material Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws&rdquo; below.

Rights
of Our Preferred Stock

We
are authorized to issue preferred stock with such designation
 rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by
our Board of Directors. Accordingly
 our Board of Directors is empowered
 without shareholder approval
 to issue preferred stock
with dividend
 liquidation
 conversion
 voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of
the holders of our common stock and
 in certain instances
 could adversely affect the market price of this stock. In the event
of issuance
 the preferred stock could be utilized
 under certain circumstances
 as a method of discouraging
 delaying or preventing
a change in control of our company or making removal of management more difficult. Please see &ldquo;Material Provisions of our
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws&rdquo; below.

Material
Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws

Our
articles of incorporation
 as amended
 and bylaws
 contain provisions that could discourage
 delay or prevent a tender offer or
takeover attempt at a price which many shareholders may find attractive. The existence of these provisions could limit the price
that investors might otherwise pay in the future for shares of our common stock.


    
    


Articles
of Incorporation
 as Amended
 and Bylaws

Blank
Check Preferred Stock
 our preferred stock could be issued quickly and utilized
 under certain circumstances
as a method of discouraging
 delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult.
As of the date of the prospectus
 we have no outstanding shares of preferred stock.

Election
of Directors
 as amended
 provide for the filling of vacancies occurring on the Board of Directors
by certain votes of the remaining directors. These provisions may discourage a third party from voting to remove incumbent directors
and simultaneously gaining control of the Board of Directors by filling the vacancies created by that removal with its own nominees.

.
Our articles of incorporation
 as amended
 and bylaws provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the fullest
extent allowed by applicable law. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted
to directors
 officers or persons controlling us under the provisions that we describe above or otherwise
 we have been informed
that in the opinion of the SEC
 this indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore
unenforceable.

Transfer
Agent and Registrar

The
transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company.

Florida
Anti-Takeover Statute

As
a Florida corporation
 we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions that apply to public corporations under Florida law.
Pursuant to Section 607.0901 of the Florida Business Corporation Act
 or the Florida Act
 a publicly held Florida corporation
may not engage in a broad range of business combinations or other extraordinary corporate transactions with an interested shareholder
without the approval of the holders of two-thirds of the voting shares of the corporation (excluding shares held by the interested
shareholder)
 unless:



    
    
the
    transaction is approved by a majority of disinterested directors before the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder;

    
    
    

    
    
the
    interested shareholder has owned at least 80% of the corporation&rsquo;s outstanding voting shares for at least five years
    preceding the announcement date of any such business combination;

    
    
    

    
    
the
    interested shareholder is the beneficial owner of at least 90% of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation
 exclusive
    of shares acquired directly from the corporation in a transaction not approved by a majority of the disinterested directors;
    or

    
    
    

    
    
the
    consideration paid to the holders of the corporation&rsquo;s voting stock is at least equal to certain fair price criteria.


An
interested shareholder is defined as a person who together with affiliates and associates beneficially owns more than 10% of a
corporation&rsquo;s outstanding voting shares. We have not made an election in our articles of incorporation
 as amended
 to opt
out of Section 607.0901.

In
addition
 we are subject to Section 607.0902 of the Florida Act which prohibits the voting of shares in a publicly held Florida
corporation that are acquired in a control share acquisition unless (i) our Board of Directors approved such acquisition prior
to its consummation or (ii) after such acquisition
 in lieu of prior approval by our Board of Directors
 the holders of a majority
of the corporation&rsquo;s voting shares
 exclusive of shares owned by officers of the corporation
 employee directors or the
acquiring party
 approve the granting of voting rights as to the shares acquired in the control share acquisition. A control share
acquisition is defined as an acquisition that immediately thereafter entitles the acquiring party to 20% or more of the total
voting power in an election of directors.

 the Company has elected not to assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation&#13;        at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods to the customer&#13;        will be one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining&#13;        a contract as an expense when incurred as the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized&#13;        will be one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction&#13;        price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing&#13;        transaction and collected by the Company from a customer
 i.e excise taxes (see note 1N). As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company&#13;        has elected to account for any shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer obtains control of any goods as activities&#13;        to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods

The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Company&amp;#8217;s forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including

 or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis

 &amp;#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and&#13;Other&amp;#8221;
 impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting&#13;units with the carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine&#13;whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step impairment&#13;test shall be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes&#13;in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates that most&#13;significantly affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth

 selling and marketing expenses and&#13;discount rates. Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s net assets&#13;exceeds the unit&amp;#8217;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of&#13;goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill&#13;recognized in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid.

 &amp;#8220;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&amp;#8221;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments recorded during the years ended March 31

 or with respect to the Company&amp;#8217;s debt



&#13;        the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &amp;#8220;2017 Tax Act&amp;#8221;) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing&#13;        U.S. tax laws that impact the Company
 most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years&#13;        beginning after December 31
 2017. The Company recognized the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in its financial statements&#13;        in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118
 which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740
 &amp;#8220;Income&#13;        Taxes&amp;#8221;
 (&amp;#8220;ASC 740&amp;#8221;) in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The Company completed&#13;        its assessment of income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act during fiscal year ended March 31

 2018. For fiscal year companies
 the change in&#13;        law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the fiscal year

 the FASB&#13;issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-02&amp;#8221;)
 which provides guidance for accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 requires&#13;lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases and to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all&#13;leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of the lease classification. The lease classification will determine whether&#13;the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest rate method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.&#13;For leases with a term of 12 months or less for which there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is&#13;reasonably certain to exercise
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to&#13;recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis&#13;over the lease term. Certain qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures will be required so that users&#13;are able to understand more about the nature of an entity&amp;#8217;s leasing activities. Accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged&#13;from current U.S. GAAP. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-10
 Codification Improvements to Topic 842
 Leases and ASU 2018-11&#13;&amp;#8220;Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements&amp;#8221; (ASU 2018-11). ASU 2018-10 clarifies certain areas within ASU 2016-02.&#13;Prior to ASU 2018-11
 a modified retrospective transition was required for financing or operating leases existing at or entered&#13;into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. ASU 2018-11 allows entities&#13;an additional transition method to the existing requirements whereby an entity could adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-02 by recognizing&#13;a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without adjustment to the&#13;financial statements for periods prior to adoption. ASU 2018-11 also allows a practical expedient that permits lessors to not separate&#13;non-lease components from the associated lease component if certain conditions are present. An entity that elects to use the practical&#13;expedients will
 in effect
 continue to account for leases that commenced before the effective date in accordance with previous&#13;GAAP unless the lease is modified
 except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for&#13;all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked&#13;and disclosed under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02
 ASU 2018-10 and ASU 2018-11 will be effective for the Company&amp;#8217;s fiscal year&#13;beginning April 1

 supply and warehousing agreements&#13;determined to be subject to the standard. The expedients grant the Company the ability to forgo reassessing lease classifications&#13;and whether any expired or existing contracts are
 or contain
 leases. The Company plans to follow the guidance of ASU 2018-11&#13;and will not recast its comparative periods. The comparative periods will follow the guidance of ASC 840
 while the current period&#13;will follow the guidance of the new ASC 842. As needed
 the periods will be bridged by a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained&#13;earnings as of April 1

 the FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2016-18
 &amp;#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
 a consensus of the FASB&amp;#8217;s Emerging Issues&#13;Task Force (the &amp;#8220;Task Force&amp;#8221;).&amp;#8221; The new standard requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change&#13;during the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash&#13;equivalents. Entities will also be required to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of&#13;the restrictions. The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018 using a retrospective adoption method
 which resulted in&#13;an adjustment to &amp;#8220;Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash&amp;#8221; on the accompanying consolidated statement of&#13;cashflows. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results&#13;of operations

This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. Entities must apply a modified retrospective basis&#13;through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company determined&#13;that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 2018. Adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis
 unless impracticable&#13;for any of the amendments
 in which case a prospective application is permitted. The Company determined that the adoption of this&#13;guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross&#13;versus Net) (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-08&amp;#8221;). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09
&#13;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&amp;#8220;ASU 2014-9&amp;#8221;)
 instead
 the amendments in this ASU are intended&#13;to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether&#13;an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as&#13;the new standard issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new standard outlines a new
 single comprehensive&#13;model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition&#13;guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new standard contains principles to determine the measurement of revenue and&#13;timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is&#13;recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in&#13;an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In&#13;addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and&#13;cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018 by applying the modified&#13;retrospective method
 which did not result in a transition adjustment nor an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company&#13;determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB&#13;issued ASU 2016-01
 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and&#13;Financial Liabilities&amp;#8221;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.&#13;Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value&#13;option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Also
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to&#13;the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale&#13;debt securities. The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018
 which did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment&#13;to the balance sheet. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;results of operations

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury&#13;yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option. The Company has not paid dividends on its common&#13;stock in the past and does not plan to pay any dividends on its common stock in the near future.

 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis

 &amp;#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other&amp;#8221;
&#13;impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with the&#13;carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it&#13;is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step impairment test shall&#13;be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes in estimates&#13;or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates that most significantly&#13;affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth
 cost of sales
 selling and marketing expenses and discount rates.&#13;Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s net assets exceeds the&#13;unit&amp;#8217;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over&#13;its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized&#13;in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid.

 2019 and 2018
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of each reporting&#13;unit were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&amp;#8217; impairment testing results
 budget to actual results
&#13;Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based on this assessment


 &amp;#8220;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&amp;#8221;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments recorded during the years ended March 31

 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The Company believes that there is no material difference between the fair-value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the Company&amp;#8217;s balance sheets due to the short-term maturity of these instruments

 2018. For fiscal year companies
 the change in&#13;        law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the fiscal year
 which in the Company&amp;#8217;s case is 30.79%&#13;        for the fiscal year ended March 31

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2018-09
 &amp;#8220;Codification Improvements.&amp;#8221; This ASU makes amendments to a wide variety of codification topics in the&#13;FASB&amp;#8217;s Accounting Standards Codification. The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances&#13;of each amendment. Some of the amendments in this ASU do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon issuance of&#13;this ASU. However
 many of the amendments in this ASU do have transition guidance with effective dates for annual periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance&#13;will have on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 &amp;#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.&amp;#8221;&#13;This ASU expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payments to non-employees for goods or services. This ASU also clarifies&#13;that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted&#13;in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Revenue from Contracts with&#13;Customers (Topic 606). This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2019
 with early adoption permitted. The Company&#13;determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU&#13;amends the requirement on the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The ASU is effective&#13;for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted
&#13;but not earlier than annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2018. This amendment should be applied on a modified&#13;retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The&#13;Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;results of operations

 the FASB&#13;issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-02&amp;#8221;)
 which provides guidance for accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 requires&#13;lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases and to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all&#13;leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of the lease classification. The lease classification will determine whether&#13;the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest rate method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.&#13;For leases with a term of 12 months or less for which there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is&#13;reasonably certain to exercise
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to&#13;recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis&#13;over the lease term. Certain qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures will be required so that users&#13;are able to understand more about the nature of an entity&amp;#8217;s leasing activities. Accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged&#13;from current U.S. GAAP. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-10
 Codification Improvements to Topic 842
 Leases and ASU 2018-11&#13;&amp;#8220;Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements&amp;#8221; (ASU 2018-11). ASU 2018-10 clarifies certain areas within ASU 2016-02.&#13;Prior to ASU 2018-11
 a modified retrospective transition was required for financing or operating leases existing at or entered&#13;into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. ASU 2018-11 allows entities&#13;an additional transition method to the existing requirements whereby an entity could adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-02 by recognizing&#13;a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without adjustment to the&#13;financial statements for periods prior to adoption. ASU 2018-11 also allows a practical expedient that permits lessors to not separate&#13;non-lease components from the associated lease component if certain conditions are present. An entity that elects to use the practical&#13;expedients will
 in effect
 continue to account for leases that commenced before the effective date in accordance with previous&#13;GAAP unless the lease is modified
 except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for&#13;all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked&#13;and disclosed under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02
 ASU 2018-10 and ASU 2018-11 will be effective for the Company&amp;#8217;s fiscal year&#13;beginning April 1

 supply and warehousing agreements&#13;determined to be subject to the standard. The expedients grant the Company the ability to forgo reassessing lease classifications&#13;and whether any expired or existing contracts are
 or contain
 leases. The Company plans to follow the guidance of ASU 2018-11&#13;and will not recast its comparative periods. The comparative periods will follow the guidance of ASC 840
 while the current period&#13;will follow the guidance of the new ASC 842. As needed
 the periods will be bridged by a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained&#13;earnings as of April 1

 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&amp;#8220;ASU 2018-02&amp;#8221;)
 which allows for stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the 2017 Tax Act to be reclassified to retained earnings. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2017-09
 &amp;#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.&amp;#8221; ASU 2017-09 provides guidance&#13;about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting.&#13;This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did&#13;not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2017-01
 &amp;#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&amp;#8221; This ASU
 which must&#13;be applied prospectively
 provides a narrower framework to be used to determine if a set of assets and activities constitutes a&#13;business than under current guidance and is generally expected to result in greater consistency in the application of ASC Topic&#13;805
 Business Combinations. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the&#13;adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2016-18
 &amp;#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
 a consensus of the FASB&amp;#8217;s Emerging Issues Task&#13;Force (the &amp;#8220;Task Force&amp;#8221;).&amp;#8221; The new standard requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during&#13;the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.&#13;Entities will also be required to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of the restrictions.&#13;The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018 using a retrospective adoption method
 which resulted in an adjustment to&#13;&amp;#8220;Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash&amp;#8221; on the accompanying consolidated statement of cashflows. The&#13;Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2016-16
 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.&amp;#8221; This ASU removes the prohibition&#13;against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than&#13;inventory. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. Entities must apply a modified retrospective basis&#13;through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company determined&#13;that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2016-15
 &amp;#8220;Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments&amp;#8221;
 which provides&#13;guidance on eight cash flow classification issues with the objective of reducing differences in practice. The new standard became&#13;effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. Adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis
 unless impracticable for any&#13;of the amendments
 in which case a prospective application is permitted. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance&#13;did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2016-08
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus&#13;Net) (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-08&amp;#8221;). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09
 Revenue&#13;from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&amp;#8220;ASU 2014-9&amp;#8221;)
 instead
 the amendments in this ASU are intended to improve&#13;the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity&#13;reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new standard&#13;issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new standard outlines a new
 single comprehensive model for&#13;entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition&#13;guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new standard contains principles to determine the measurement of revenue and&#13;timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is&#13;recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in&#13;an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In&#13;addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and&#13;cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018 by applying the modified&#13;retrospective method
 which did not result in a transition adjustment nor an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company&#13;determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2016-01
 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial&#13;Liabilities&amp;#8221;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes&#13;to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
&#13;and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Also
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation&#13;allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.&#13;The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018
 which did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet.&#13;The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations

 the Company has elected not to assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation&#13;        at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods to the customer&#13;        will be one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining&#13;        a contract as an expense when incurred as the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized&#13;        will be one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction&#13;        price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing&#13;        transaction and collected by the Company from a customer
 i.e excise taxes (see note 1N). As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company&#13;        has elected to account for any shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer obtains control of any goods as activities&#13;        to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods

 management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be&#13;realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods&#13;in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. The Company considers&#13;the level of historical taxable income
 scheduled reversal of temporary differences
 tax planning strategies and projected future&#13;taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted. Based on historical taxable income and projected future&#13;taxable income
 the Company concluded as of March 31
 2019 that certain of its U.S. deferred tax assets are realizable on a more-likely-than-not&#13;basis. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on Section 163(j) deferred interest carryforwards and a partial valuation allowance&#13;on certain state net operating losses. The Company&amp;#8217;s valuation allowance decreased by $9
607
000 during fiscal 2019 as certain&#13;of the U.S. deferred tax assets became realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis as of March 31

 the Company&#13;does not amortize indefinite lived-intangible assets for financial reporting purposes. The company recorded a deferred tax liability&#13;of $514

 2019
 the Company had&#13;U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $76
683
000 of which $36
088
000 expire in fiscal 2025 through 2036
&#13;if not utilized. The remaining $40
595
000 of the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a significant annual&#13;limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and are expected to expire unutilized. The Company has reduced the deferred&#13;tax asset and related valuation allowance for the net operating losses which are expected to expire unutilized in the deferred&#13;tax asset and liability table above for the fiscal years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018. The Company also has foreign net operating&#13;loss carryforwards of approximately $13
366
000

 2019
 the Company has&#13;not provided for U.S. federal and foreign withholding taxes on any excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments&#13;in foreign subsidiaries
 as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested overseas. If these future earnings are repatriated to the&#13;U.S.
 or if the Company determines that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future
 the Company may be required to&#13;accrue U.S. deferred taxes (if any) and applicable withholding taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the tax impact of the reversal&#13;of the outside basis difference

 excluding interest and penalties










 2019
 the entire amount would reduce the Company&amp;#8217;s effective tax rate if recognized. The Company records&#13;accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters in general and administrative expenses. For the year ended March 31
&#13;2019 and 2018
 the Company recognized an expense related to interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $2
000 and $1
000
&#13;respectively. For the year ended March 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company&amp;#8217;s accrual for interest and penalties related to unrecognized&#13;tax benefits is $3
000 and $1
000

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



    
 - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Castle Brands Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
 its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries
 Castle Brands (USA) Corp. (&#8220;CB-USA&#8221;) and McLain &#38; Kyne
 Ltd. (&#8220;McLain &#38; Kyne&#8221;)
 the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries
 Castle Brands Spirits Group Limited (&#8220;CB-IRL&#8221;) and Castle Brands Spirits Marketing and Sales Company Limited
 and the Company&#8217;s 80.1% ownership interest in Gosling-Castle Partners Inc. (&#8220;GCP&#8221;)
 with adjustments for income or loss allocated based upon percentage of ownership. The accounts of the subsidiaries have been included as of the date of acquisition. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

    
    

    
    
 -
        The Company is principally engaged in the importation
 marketing and sale of premium and super premium rums
 whiskey
 liqueurs
        vodka and related non-alcoholic beverage products in the United States
 Canada
 Europe and Asia.
        

    
    

        its current cash and working capital and the availability under the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8C) will enable it to fund
        its obligations
 meet its working capital needs
 maturing debt obligations and whiskey purchase commitments until it achieves profitability
        ensure continuity of supply of its brands and support new brand initiatives and marketing programs through at least June 2020.
        The Company believes it can continue to meet its operating needs through additional mechanisms
 if necessary
 including additional
        or expanded debt financings
 potential equity offerings and limiting or adjusting the timing of additional inventory purchases
        based on available resources. In addition
 as detailed in Note 11
 based on historical operating results
 projected positive trend
        of earnings and projected future taxable income
 the Company concluded as of March 31
 2019 that certain of its U.S. deferred tax
        assets may be realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. As a result
 the Company&#8217;s valuation allowance decreased by $9
607
000
        during fiscal 2019.
        

        and 11% Subordinated Note (as defined in Note 8C) are set to expire on July 31
 2020 and September 30
 15
 2020
 respectively.
        The Company is currently negotiating the restructuring of all or a portion of the debt
 including the Subordinated Note. This restructuring
        may consist of a combination of expanding and extending the Credit Facility
 extending the term of the Subordinated Note
 or other
        methods of paying down the debt
 although there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in such restructuring.

- Equity investments are carried at original cost adjusted for the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the investees&#8217; income
 losses and distributions. The Company assesses the carrying value of its equity investments when an indicator of a loss in value is present and records a loss in value of the investment when the assessment indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in the investment exists. The Company classifies its equity earnings of equity investments as a component of net income or loss.

    
    

    
 - The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect anticipated losses on the trade accounts receivable balances. The Company calculates this allowance based on its history of write-offs
 level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and its relationships with and economic status of its customers. For the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for doubtful accounts of $93
236
 $59
012 and $123
200
 respectively.

    
    

    
    
- The Company operates
        in one reportable segment and derives substantially all of its revenue from the sale and delivery of premium beverage alcohol and
        related non-beverage alcohol products. In the U.S.
 the Company is required by law to use state-licensed distributors or
 in the
        control states
 state-owned agencies performing this function
 to sell its brands to retail outlets. In its international markets
        the Company relies primarily on established spirits distributors in much the same way as in the U.S. Revenue from product sales
        is recognized when the product is shipped to a customer (generally a distributor) and title and risk of loss has passed to the
        customer in accordance with the terms of sale and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is not recognized on shipments to control
        states in the United States until such time as product is sold through to the retail channel.
        

        it has received an order or other documentation authorizing delivery to its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration
        the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. The Company generally does not provide post-delivery services
        and does not offer a right-of-return except in the case of an error. Uncollectable accounts receivable are estimated by using a
        combination of historical customer experience and a customer-by-customer analysis. The Company&#8217;s payment terms vary by customer
        and
 in certain cases
 the products offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. As permitted
        under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected not to assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation
        at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods to the customer
        will be one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining
        a contract as an expense when incurred as the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized
        will be one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction
        price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing
        transaction and collected by the Company from a customer
 i.e excise taxes (see note 1N). As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company
        has elected to account for any shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer obtains control of any goods as activities
        to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods
 and the Company is not required to evaluate whether such shipping and handling activities
        are promised services to its customers.




    
- Inventories are comprised of distilled spirits
 dry good raw materials (bottles
 labels
 corks and caps)
 packaging
 finished goods
 excise taxes and freight and are valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the weighted average cost method. The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Company&#8217;s forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including
 but not limited to
 historical usage
 expected future demand and market requirements. A change to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold. See Note 3.



31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for obsolete and slow-moving inventory of $545
500
 $376
611
and $240
000
 respectively. The Company recorded these allowances and write-offs on both raw materials and finished goods
 primarily
in connection with spoilage and slow-moving inventory
 label and packaging changes made to certain brands
 as well as adjustments
to estimated freight costs and excise taxes and certain cost variances. The charges have been recorded as increases to Cost of
Sales in the respective years.



    
- Equipment consists of office equipment
 computers and software and furniture and fixtures. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related depreciation is removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to five years.

    
    

    
 - Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price including related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized
 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis
 and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.



Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 350
 &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and
Other&#8221;
 impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting
units with the carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step impairment
test shall be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes
in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates that most
significantly affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth
 cost of sales
 selling and marketing expenses and
discount rates. Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#8217;s net assets
exceeds the unit&#8217;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of
goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill
recognized in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid. Rights
 trademarks
trade names and formulations are indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment at
least annually. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset group allocated to each reporting unit
with its allocated carrying amount.


assessment at March 31
 2019 and 2018
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of each reporting
unit were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&#8217; impairment testing results
 budget to actual results
 Company-specific
facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based on this assessment
 the Company determined
that no quantitative assessment was required.



    
 - Under ASC 310
 &#8220;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&#8221;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments recorded during the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017.




    
 - The Company reflects as inventory costs freight-in and related external handling charges relating to the purchase of raw materials and finished goods. These costs are charged to cost of sales at the time the underlying product is sold. The Company also incurs shipping costs in connection with its various marketing activities
 including the shipment of point of sale materials to the Company&#8217;s regional sales managers and customers
 and the costs of shipping product in connection with its various marketing programs and promotions. These shipping charges are included in selling expense and were $3

889
 $2
797
701 and $2
347
121 for the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

    
    

    
 - Excise taxes and duty are computed at standard rates based on alcohol proof per gallon/liter and are paid after finished goods are imported into the United States or other relevant jurisdiction and then transferred out of &#8220;bond.&#8221; Excise taxes and duty are recorded to inventory as a component of the cost of the underlying finished goods. When the underlying products are sold &#8220;ex warehouse&#8221;
 the sales price reflects the taxes paid and the inventoried excise taxes and duties are charged to cost of sales.

    
    

    
 - The Company incurs charges from its distributors for a variety of transactions and services rendered by the distributor
 including product depletions
 product samples for various promotional purposes
 in-store tastings and training where legal
 and local advertising where legal. Such charges are reflected as selling expense as incurred. Also
 the Company has entered into arrangements with certain of its distributors whereby the purchase of a particular product or products by a distributor is accompanied by a percentage of the sale being composed of promotional goods or as a predetermined discount percentage of dollars off invoice. In such cases
 the cost of the promotional goods is charged to cost of sales and dollars off invoice are a reduction to revenue.




    
 - The functional currency for the Company&#8217;s foreign operations is the Euro in Ireland and the British Pound in the United Kingdom. Under ASC 830
 &#8220;Foreign Currency Matters&#8221;
 the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations.

    
    

    
 - ASC 825
 &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The Company believes that there is no material difference between the fair-value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the Company&#8217;s balance sheets due to the short-term maturity of these instruments
 or with respect to the Company&#8217;s debt
 as compared to the current borrowing rates available to the Company.

based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument&#8217;s
categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are as follows:



    
    
    

    
    
Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and inputs that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

    
    
    




    
    
 - In December 2017
        the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;2017 Tax Act&#8221;) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing
        U.S. tax laws that impact the Company
 most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years
        beginning after December 31
 2017. The Company recognized the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in its financial statements
        in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118
 which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740
 &#8220;Income
        Taxes&#8221;
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;) in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The Company completed
        its assessment of income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act during fiscal year ended March 31
 2019. The Company made a policy election
        to treat the income tax due on U.S. inclusion of the new GILTI provisions as a period expense when incurred.
        

        corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% for all corporations effective January 1
 2018. For fiscal year companies
 the change in
        law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the fiscal year
 which in the Company&#8217;s case is 30.79%
        for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. Thereafter
 the applicable statutory rate is 21.0%.
        

 deferred tax assets and
        liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
        amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation allowance is provided to the extent a deferred
        tax asset is not considered recoverable.
        

        of ASC 740-10 and as of March 31
 2019
 the Company had reserves for uncertain tax positions (including related interest and penalties)
        for various state and local taxes of $43
816. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions
        in general and administrative expense.




    
 - The costs of research
 development and product improvement are charged to expense as incurred and are included in selling expense.

    
    

    
- Advertising and marketing costs are expensed when the advertising first appears in its respective medium. Advertising expense
 which is included in selling expense
 was $4
987
720
 $5

 respectively.

    
    

    
- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates include the accounting for items such as evaluating annual impairment tests
 derivative instruments and equity issuances
 warrant valuation
 stock-based compensation
 allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 amortization and expense accruals.




    
&#8211; In October 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) ASU No. 2018-17
 Consolidation (Topic 810): Targeted Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities. The guidance requires indirect interests held through related parties under common control arrangements be considered on a proportional basis for determining whether fees paid to decision makers and service providers are variable interests. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.



 the FASB
issued ASU No. 2018-16
 Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) Overnight Index Swap (&#8220;OIS&#8221;)
Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes (&#8220;ASU 2018-16&#8221;)
 which amends ASC 815
 Derivatives
and Hedging. This ASU adds the OIS rate based on SOFR to the list of permissible benchmark rates for hedge accounting purposes.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Adoption of ASU 2018-16 will be on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on
or after the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this
guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2018-15
 Intangibles - Goodwill
and Other Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing
Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. The amendments in this update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs
incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred
to develop or obtain internal-use software. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to
determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2018-13
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for
Fair Value Measurement.&#8221; This ASU adds
 modifies and removes several disclosure requirements relative to the three levels
of inputs used to measure fair value in accordance with Topic 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurement.&#8221; This guidance is effective
for the Company as of April 1
 2020
 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine
the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2018-09
 &#8220;Codification Improvements.&#8221; This ASU makes amendments to a wide variety of codification topics in the
FASB&#8217;s Accounting Standards Codification. The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances
of each amendment. Some of the amendments in this ASU do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon issuance of
this ASU. However
 many of the amendments in this ASU do have transition guidance with effective dates for annual periods beginning
after December 15
 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance
will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2018-07
 &#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.&#8221;
This ASU expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payments to non-employees for goods or services. This ASU also clarifies
that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted
in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606). This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2019
 with early adoption permitted. The Company
determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash
flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU
amends the requirement on the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The ASU is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted
but not earlier than annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2018. This amendment should be applied on a modified
retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The
Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s
results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (&#8220;ASU 2016-02&#8221;)
 which provides guidance for accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 requires
lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases and to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all
leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of the lease classification. The lease classification will determine whether
the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest rate method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
For leases with a term of 12 months or less for which there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. Certain qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures will be required so that users
are able to understand more about the nature of an entity&#8217;s leasing activities. Accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged
from current U.S. GAAP. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-10
 Codification Improvements to Topic 842
 Leases and ASU 2018-11
&#8220;Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements&#8221; (ASU 2018-11). ASU 2018-10 clarifies certain areas within ASU 2016-02.
Prior to ASU 2018-11
 a modified retrospective transition was required for financing or operating leases existing at or entered
into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. ASU 2018-11 allows entities
an additional transition method to the existing requirements whereby an entity could adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-02 by recognizing
a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without adjustment to the
financial statements for periods prior to adoption. ASU 2018-11 also allows a practical expedient that permits lessors to not separate
non-lease components from the associated lease component if certain conditions are present. An entity that elects to use the practical
expedients will
 in effect
 continue to account for leases that commenced before the effective date in accordance with previous
GAAP unless the lease is modified
 except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for
all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked
and disclosed under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02
 ASU 2018-10 and ASU 2018-11 will be effective for the Company&#8217;s fiscal year
beginning April 1
 2019 and subsequent interim periods.

and will not recast its comparative periods. The comparative periods will follow the guidance of ASC 840
 while the current period
will follow the guidance of the new ASC 842. As needed
 the periods will be bridged by a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of April 1
 2019.

its Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Statements of Operations
 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income
 or its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The new

 - In February 2018
 FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02
 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;ASU 2018-02&#8221;)
 which allows for stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the 2017 Tax Act to be reclassified to retained earnings. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.



 the FASB issued
ASU 2017-09
 &#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.&#8221; ASU 2017-09 provides
guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification
accounting. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the adoption of this
guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU No. 2017-01
 &#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&#8221; This ASU
 which
must be applied prospectively
 provides a narrower framework to be used to determine if a set of assets and activities constitutes
a business than under current guidance and is generally expected to result in greater consistency in the application of ASC Topic
805
 Business Combinations. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the
adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-18
 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
 a consensus of the FASB&#8217;s Emerging Issues
Task Force (the &#8220;Task Force&#8221;).&#8221; The new standard requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change
during the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash
equivalents. Entities will also be required to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of
the restrictions. The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018 using a retrospective adoption method
 which resulted in
an adjustment to &#8220;Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash&#8221; on the accompanying consolidated statement of
cashflows. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results
of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2016-16
 &#8220;Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.&#8221; This ASU removes the prohibition
against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than
inventory. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. Entities must apply a modified retrospective basis
through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company determined
that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and
financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-15
 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments&#8221;
 which
provides guidance on eight cash flow classification issues with the objective of reducing differences in practice. The new standard
became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. Adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis
 unless impracticable
for any of the amendments
 in which case a prospective application is permitted. The Company determined that the adoption of this
guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-08
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross
versus Net) (&#8220;ASU 2016-08&#8221;). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&#8220;ASU 2014-9&#8221;)
 instead
 the amendments in this ASU are intended
to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether
an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as
the new standard issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new standard outlines a new
 single comprehensive
model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition
guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new standard contains principles to determine the measurement of revenue and
timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is
recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In
addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018 by applying the modified
retrospective method
 which did not result in a transition adjustment nor an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company
determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash
flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2016-01
 &#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities&#8221;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments

tax assets
 management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods
in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. The Company considers
the level of historical taxable income
 scheduled reversal of temporary differences
 tax planning strategies and projected future
taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted. Based on historical taxable income and projected future
taxable income
 the Company concluded as of March 31
 2019 that certain of its U.S. deferred tax assets are realizable on a more-likely-than-not
basis. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on Section 163(j) deferred interest carryforwards and a partial valuation allowance
on certain state net operating losses. The Company&#8217;s valuation allowance decreased by $9
607
000 during fiscal 2019 as certain
of the U.S. deferred tax assets became realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis as of March 31
 2019.


 the Company
does not amortize indefinite lived-intangible assets for financial reporting purposes. The company recorded a deferred tax liability
of $514
000 related to the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of intangible assets related
to its Ireland operations.


 2019
 the Company had
U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $76
683
000 of which $36
088
000 expire in fiscal 2025 through 2036
if not utilized. The remaining $40
595
000 of the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a significant annual
limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and are expected to expire unutilized. The Company has reduced the deferred
tax asset and related valuation allowance for the net operating losses which are expected to expire unutilized in the deferred
tax asset and liability table above for the fiscal years ended March 31
 2019 and 2018. The Company also has foreign net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $13
366
000
 which have an indefinite life.


 2019
 the Company has
not provided for U.S. federal and foreign withholding taxes on any excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments
in foreign subsidiaries
 as such earnings are indefinitely reinvested overseas. If these future earnings are repatriated to the
U.S.
 or if the Company determines that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future
 the Company may be required to
accrue U.S. deferred taxes (if any) and applicable withholding taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the tax impact of the reversal
of the outside basis difference
 or the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation.

 the entire amount would reduce the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate if recognized. The Company records
accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters in general and administrative expenses. For the year ended March 31
2019 and 2018
 the Company recognized an expense related to interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $2
000 and $1
000
respectively. For the year ended March 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company&#8217;s accrual for interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits is $3
000 and $1
000
 respectively. The Company does not believe that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

 there were 2
000
000
shares of common stock available for distribution under the 2003 Plan. In January 2009
 the Company&#8217;s shareholders approved
an amendment to the 2003 Plan to increase the number of shares available under the 2003 Plan from 2
000
000 to 12
000
000 and to
establish the maximum number of shares issuable to any one individual in any particular year. As of August 2013
 no new awards
may be issued under the 2003 Plan.


 the Company&#8217;s

000
000
shares of the Company&#8217;s stock for awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options
 restricted stock and stock appreciation
rights for its officers
 employees
 consultants and directors to attract and retain such individuals. In February 2017
 the Company&#8217;s
shareholders approved an amendment to the 2013 Plan to increase the number of shares available under the 2013 Plan from 10
000
000
to 20
000
000. As of March 31
 2019
 10
206
691 shares had been issued under the 2013 Plan
 with 9
793
309 shares remaining available
for issuance.


the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017 amounted to $1
971
464
 $1
974
745 and $1
577
994
 respectively
 of which $767

 respectively
 is
included in general and administrative expense for the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. At March 31
 2019
total unrecognized compensation cost amounted to approximately $2
722
142
 representing 2
121
875 unvested options and 2
029
250
unvested restricted shares. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.9 years for the unvested
options and 2.53 years for the unvested restricted shares. There were 1
559
533
 356
700 and 671
028 options exercised during the
years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The Company did not recognize any related tax benefit for the years ended
March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 as the effects were de minimis.

under the 2003 and 2013 Plans was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is affected by assumptions
regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The use of an option pricing model also requires the use of a number of
complex assumptions including expected volatility
 risk-free interest rate
 expected dividends
 and expected term. Expected volatility
is based on the Company&#8217;s historical volatility and the volatility of a peer group of companies over the expected life of
the option. The expected term and vesting of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise. The expected term
was determined using the simplified method available under current guidance. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option. The Company has not paid dividends on its common
stock in the past and does not plan to pay any dividends on its common stock in the near future. Current authoritative guidance
also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates
 if necessary
 in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company estimates forfeitures based on its expectation of future
experience while considering its historical experience.

- Equity investments are carried at original cost adjusted for the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the investees&#8217; income
 losses and distributions. The Company assesses the carrying value of its equity investments when an indicator of a loss in value is present and records a loss in value of the investment when the assessment indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in the investment exists. The Company classifies its equity earnings of equity investments as a component of net income or loss.









    
 - The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect anticipated losses on the trade accounts receivable balances. The Company calculates this allowance based on its history of write-offs
 level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and its relationships with and economic status of its customers. For the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for doubtful accounts of $93
236
 $59
012 and $123
200
 respectively.









    
    
- The Company operates
        in one reportable segment and derives substantially all of its revenue from the sale and delivery of premium beverage alcohol and
        related non-beverage alcohol products. In the U.S.
 the Company is required by law to use state-licensed distributors or
 in the
        control states
 state-owned agencies performing this function
 to sell its brands to retail outlets. In its international markets
        the Company relies primarily on established spirits distributors in much the same way as in the U.S. Revenue from product sales
        is recognized when the product is shipped to a customer (generally a distributor) and title and risk of loss has passed to the
        customer in accordance with the terms of sale and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is not recognized on shipments to control
        states in the United States until such time as product is sold through to the retail channel.
        

        it has received an order or other documentation authorizing delivery to its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration
        the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. The Company generally does not provide post-delivery services
        and does not offer a right-of-return except in the case of an error. Uncollectable accounts receivable are estimated by using a
        combination of historical customer experience and a customer-by-customer analysis. The Company&#8217;s payment terms vary by customer
        and
 in certain cases
 the products offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. As permitted
        under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected not to assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation
        at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods to the customer
        will be one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining
        a contract as an expense when incurred as the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized
        will be one year or less. As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company has elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction
        price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing
        transaction and collected by the Company from a customer
 i.e excise taxes (see note 1N). As permitted under U.S. GAAP
 the Company
        has elected to account for any shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer obtains control of any goods as activities
        to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods
 and the Company is not required to evaluate whether such shipping and handling activities
        are promised services to its customers.









    
- Inventories are comprised of distilled spirits
 dry good raw materials (bottles
 labels
 corks and caps)
 packaging
 finished goods
 excise taxes and freight and are valued at the lower of cost or market
 using the weighted average cost method. The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Company&#8217;s forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including
 but not limited to
 historical usage
 expected future demand and market requirements. A change to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold. See Note 3.



31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 the Company recorded an addition to allowances for obsolete and slow-moving inventory of $545
500
 $376
611
and $240
000
 respectively. The Company recorded these allowances and write-offs on both raw materials and finished goods
 primarily
in connection with spoilage and slow-moving inventory
 label and packaging changes made to certain brands
 as well as adjustments
to estimated freight costs and excise taxes and certain cost variances. The charges have been recorded as increases to Cost of
Sales in the respective years.







    
- Equipment consists of office equipment
 computers and software and furniture and fixtures. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related depreciation is removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to five years.









    
 - Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price including related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized
 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
 generally on a straight-line basis
 and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.



Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 350
 &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other&#8221;
impairment of goodwill must be tested at least annually by comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with the
carrying amount of their net assets
 including goodwill. An entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it
is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary
 the two-step impairment test shall
be used. The required two-step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results. Changes in estimates
or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. The estimates that most significantly
affect the fair value calculation are related to revenue growth
 cost of sales
 selling and marketing expenses and discount rates.
Impairment testing is done at the reporting level. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#8217;s net assets exceeds the
unit&#8217;s fair value
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over
its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized
in a business combination with the fair value of the reporting unit deemed to be the purchase price paid. Rights
 trademarks
 trade
names and formulations are indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment at least
annually. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset group allocated to each reporting unit with
its allocated carrying amount.


assessment at March 31
 2019 and 2018
 various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of each reporting
unit were identified
 including
 but not limited to: prior years&#8217; impairment testing results
 budget to actual results
Company-specific facts and circumstances
 industry developments
 and the economic environment. Based on this assessment
 the Company
determined that no quantitative assessment was required.







    
 - Under ASC 310
 &#8220;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets&#8221;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying amounts of its definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. There were no impairments recorded during the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017.









    
 - The Company reflects as inventory costs freight-in and related external handling charges relating to the purchase of raw materials and finished goods. These costs are charged to cost of sales at the time the underlying product is sold. The Company also incurs shipping costs in connection with its various marketing activities
 including the shipment of point of sale materials to the Company&#8217;s regional sales managers and customers
 and the costs of shipping product in connection with its various marketing programs and promotions. These shipping charges are included in selling expense and were $3
261
889
 $2
797
701 and $2
347
121 for the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.









    
 - Excise taxes and duty are computed at standard rates based on alcohol proof per gallon/liter and are paid after finished goods are imported into the United States or other relevant jurisdiction and then transferred out of &#8220;bond.&#8221; Excise taxes and duty are recorded to inventory as a component of the cost of the underlying finished goods. When the underlying products are sold &#8220;ex warehouse&#8221;
 the sales price reflects the taxes paid and the inventoried excise taxes and duties are charged to cost of sales.









    
 - The Company incurs charges from its distributors for a variety of transactions and services rendered by the distributor
 including product depletions
 product samples for various promotional purposes
 in-store tastings and training where legal
 and local advertising where legal. Such charges are reflected as selling expense as incurred. Also
 the Company has entered into arrangements with certain of its distributors whereby the purchase of a particular product or products by a distributor is accompanied by a percentage of the sale being composed of promotional goods or as a predetermined discount percentage of dollars off invoice. In such cases
 the cost of the promotional goods is charged to cost of sales and dollars off invoice are a reduction to revenue.









    
 - The functional currency for the Company&#8217;s foreign operations is the Euro in Ireland and the British Pound in the United Kingdom. Under ASC 830
 &#8220;Foreign Currency Matters&#8221;
 the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations.









    
 - ASC 825
 &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221;
 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The Company believes that there is no material difference between the fair-value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the Company&#8217;s balance sheets due to the short-term maturity of these instruments
 or with respect to the Company&#8217;s debt
 as compared to the current borrowing rates available to the Company.



are reported at fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance
 which accomplishes the following key objectives:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    



upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument&#8217;s
categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are as follows:



    
    
    

    
    
Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and inputs that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

    
    
    









    
    
 - In December 2017
        the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;2017 Tax Act&#8221;) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing
        U.S. tax laws that impact the Company
 most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years
        beginning after December 31
 2017. The Company recognized the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in its financial statements
        in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118
 which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740
 &#8220;Income
        Taxes&#8221;
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;) in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The Company completed
        its assessment of income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act during fiscal year ended March 31
 2019. The Company made a policy election
        to treat the income tax due on U.S. inclusion of the new GILTI provisions as a period expense when incurred.
        

        corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% for all corporations effective January 1
 2018. For fiscal year companies
 the change in
        law requires the application of a blended rate for each quarter of the fiscal year
 which in the Company&#8217;s case is 30.79%
        for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. Thereafter
 the applicable statutory rate is 21.0%.
        

 deferred tax assets and
        liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
        amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation allowance is provided to the extent a deferred
        tax asset is not considered recoverable.
        

        of ASC 740-10 and as of March 31
 2019
 the Company had reserves for uncertain tax positions (including related interest and penalties)
        for various state and local taxes of $43
816. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions
        in general and administrative expense.









    
 - The costs of research
 development and product improvement are charged to expense as incurred and are included in selling expense.









    
 - Advertising and marketing costs are expensed when the advertising first appears in its respective medium. Advertising expense
 which is included in selling expense
 was $4
987
720
 $5
013
523 and $4
486
796 for the years ended March 31
 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.









    
- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates include the accounting for items such as evaluating annual impairment tests
 derivative instruments and equity issuances
 warrant valuation
 stock-based compensation
 allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 amortization and expense accruals.









    
 &#8211; In October 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) ASU No. 2018-17
 Consolidation (Topic 810): Targeted Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities. The guidance requires indirect interests held through related parties under common control arrangements be considered on a proportional basis for determining whether fees paid to decision makers and service providers are variable interests. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.



 the FASB
issued ASU No. 2018-16
 Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) Overnight Index Swap (&#8220;OIS&#8221;)
Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes (&#8220;ASU 2018-16&#8221;)
 which amends ASC 815
 Derivatives
and Hedging. This ASU adds the OIS rate based on SOFR to the list of permissible benchmark rates for hedge accounting purposes.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Adoption of ASU 2018-16 will be on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on
or after the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this
guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2018-15
 Intangibles - Goodwill
and Other Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing
Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. The amendments in this update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs
incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred
to develop or obtain internal-use software. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to
determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2018-13
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for
Fair Value Measurement.&#8221; This ASU adds
 modifies and removes several disclosure requirements relative to the three levels
of inputs used to measure fair value in accordance with Topic 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurement.&#8221; This guidance is effective
for the Company as of April 1
 2020
 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine
the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2018-09
 &#8220;Codification Improvements.&#8221; This ASU makes amendments to a wide variety of codification topics in the
FASB&#8217;s Accounting Standards Codification. The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances
of each amendment. Some of the amendments in this ASU do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon issuance of
this ASU. However
 many of the amendments in this ASU do have transition guidance with effective dates for annual periods beginning
after December 15
 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance
will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2018-07
 &#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.&#8221;
This ASU expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payments to non-employees for goods or services. This ASU also clarifies
that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted
in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606). This guidance is effective for the Company as of April 1
 2019
 with early adoption permitted. The Company
determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash
flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU
amends the requirement on the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The ASU is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted
but not earlier than annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2018. This amendment should be applied on a modified
retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The
Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s
results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (&#8220;ASU 2016-02&#8221;)
 which provides guidance for accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 requires
lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases and to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all
leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of the lease classification. The lease classification will determine whether
the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest rate method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
For leases with a term of 12 months or less for which there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities and should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. Certain qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures will be required so that users
are able to understand more about the nature of an entity&#8217;s leasing activities. Accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged
from current U.S. GAAP. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-10
 Codification Improvements to Topic 842
 Leases and ASU 2018-11
&#8220;Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements&#8221; (ASU 2018-11). ASU 2018-10 clarifies certain areas within ASU 2016-02.
Prior to ASU 2018-11
 a modified retrospective transition was required for financing or operating leases existing at or entered
into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. ASU 2018-11 allows entities
an additional transition method to the existing requirements whereby an entity could adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-02 by recognizing
a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without adjustment to the
financial statements for periods prior to adoption. ASU 2018-11 also allows a practical expedient that permits lessors to not separate
non-lease components from the associated lease component if certain conditions are present. An entity that elects to use the practical
expedients will
 in effect
 continue to account for leases that commenced before the effective date in accordance with previous
GAAP unless the lease is modified
 except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for
all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked
and disclosed under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02
 ASU 2018-10 and ASU 2018-11 will be effective for the Company&#8217;s fiscal year
beginning April 1
 2019 and subsequent interim periods.


the available practical expedients consistently to all of its office and office equipment leases
 supply and warehousing agreements
determined to be subject to the standard. The expedients grant the Company the ability to forgo reassessing lease classifications
and whether any expired or existing contracts are
 or contain
 leases. The Company plans to follow the guidance of ASU 2018-11
and will not recast its comparative periods. The comparative periods will follow the guidance of ASC 840
 while the current period
will follow the guidance of the new ASC 842. As needed
 the periods will be bridged by a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of April 1
 2019.


utilize the transition package of practical expedients permitted within the new standard
 which among other things
 allows the

Statements of Operations
 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income
 or its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The new
standard will not have a material impact on liquidity and will not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s debt-covenant compliance

 - In February 2018
 FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02
 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;ASU 2018-02&#8221;)
 which allows for stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the 2017 Tax Act to be reclassified to retained earnings. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.



 the FASB issued ASU
2017-09
 &#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.&#8221; ASU 2017-09 provides guidance
about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting.
This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did
not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU No. 2017-01
 &#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&#8221; This ASU
 which must
be applied prospectively
 provides a narrower framework to be used to determine if a set of assets and activities constitutes a
business than under current guidance and is generally expected to result in greater consistency in the application of ASC Topic
805
 Business Combinations. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. The Company determined that the
adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial
condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-18
 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
 a consensus of the FASB&#8217;s Emerging Issues Task
Force (the &#8220;Task Force&#8221;).&#8221; The new standard requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during
the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
Entities will also be required to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of the restrictions.
The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018 using a retrospective adoption method
 which resulted in an adjustment to
&#8220;Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash&#8221; on the accompanying consolidated statement of cashflows. The
Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-16
 &#8220;Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.&#8221; This ASU removes the prohibition
against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than
inventory. This guidance became effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. Entities must apply a modified retrospective basis
through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company determined
that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and
financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-15
 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments&#8221;
 which provides
guidance on eight cash flow classification issues with the objective of reducing differences in practice. The new standard became
effective for the Company as of April 1
 2018. Adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis
 unless impracticable for any
of the amendments
 in which case a prospective application is permitted. The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance
did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued ASU
2016-08
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus
Net) (&#8220;ASU 2016-08&#8221;). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09
 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 (&#8220;ASU 2014-9&#8221;)
 instead
 the amendments in this ASU are intended to improve
the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity
reports revenue on a gross or net basis. ASU 2016-08 will have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new standard
issued in ASU 2014-09. In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09. The new standard outlines a new
 single comprehensive model for
entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition
guidance
 including industry-specific guidance. The new standard contains principles to determine the measurement of revenue and
timing of when it is recognized. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is
recognized. Under the new model
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In
addition
 the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018 by applying the modified
retrospective method
 which did not result in a transition adjustment nor an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company
determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 cash
flows and financial condition.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2016-01
 &#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities&#8221;
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes
to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Also
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation
allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.
The Company adopted the new standard on April 1
 2018
 which did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet.
The Company determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations
cash flows and financial condition.

Stock-Based Compensation - Schedule of Share-based Payment Award
 Stock Options
 Valuation Assumptions (Details)


Mar. 31
 2017















































































The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

























































Expected term of award under share-based payment arrangement
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.
