 we received U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) approval to market rice bran as an ingredient to be used as a filler in comminuted meat products
 such as meat and poultry sausages that contain binders
 nugget-shaped patties
 meatballs
 meatloaf and meat and poultry patties.&#160; Our products replace ingredients like soy protein isolate

 especially in some of the world&#8217;s most populous countries.&#160; Asia accounts for roughly 90% of global rice production and China is the world&#8217;s number one rice producer.&#160; Globally




 individual rice kernels are stored in common receiving locations such as farm silos for future delivery to grain dryers or area rice mills.&#160; At this stage
 large quantities of individual rice kernels are collectively called &#8220;paddy rice
&#8221; or &#8220;rough&#8221; rice.&#160; In this form
 the rice kernel is fully enveloped by the rice hull
 which serves as a protective cover




 if necessary
 paddy rice is cleaned of foreign material (scalping
 de-stoning and aspiration) just before it enters the first stage of milling
 or paddy husking.&#160; In the paddy husker
 the hull is removed from rough rice by differential speed rubber rollers.&#160; Loosened hulls are carried off by aspiration.&#160; After husking




 the outer brown layers of bran are removed from the inner white starch endosperm by an abrasive or frictional milling process which produces a milled
 white rice kernel.&#160; After milling
 white rice is typically sorted by size to remove broken pieces of rice kernels from whole kernels

 an especially nutrient rich material




 the oils present in raw rice bran come into contact with native lipase enzymes that are naturally present in the rice kernel.&#160; These lipase enzymes initiate a rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil
 converting oils (triglycerides) into monoglycerides
 diglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA).&#160; As the FFA content builds in raw rice bran
 the bran becomes unpalatable and off flavors (rancidity) develop.&#160; If left unchecked
 enzymatic degradation at normal room temperatures can increase the FFA levels to 5-8% within 24 hours and can continue at a rate of approximately 4-5% per day thereafter.&#160; Enzymatic degradation is the most serious form of degradation of raw rice bran.&#160; Rice bran stabilization is the process of carefully deactivating native enzymes to prevent the increase of FFA otherwise caused by lipase enzyme activity.&#160; Proper stabilization is critical in the preservation of the nutritional value of the bran




 including the use of chemicals


















 pressure and other conditions necessary to thoroughly deactivate enzymes without significantly damaging the structure or nutrient content of raw rice bran.&#160; This means that higher value compounds in bran

200 tons per year.&#160; Stabilization production capacity can be doubled
 tripled or further multiplied by installing additional units sharing a common conveyor and stage system
 which we believe can handle the output of the world&#8217;s largest rice mills.&#160; We have also developed and tested a smaller production unit
 with a maximum production capacity of 600 pounds per hour

 During much of 2017 we repositioned our sales team to take advantage of customer types and geographic reach.&#160; We added expertise in companion animal
 snacks and bakery
 protein








 such as stabilized rice bran.&#160; We anticipate further incorporation of our food ingredients by major consumer packaged goods food companies as more food companies adopt rice bran as a standard clean label food ingredient. This trend is not limited to food ingredients









Concurrently working to strengthen our bran supply

 particularly in Arkansas and Louisiana
 which typically account for near 70% of the U.S. rice harvest (over 50% in Arkansas alone).&#160; Building a stronger presence in the Delta will also provide us with logistical benefits to serve our customers located east of the Rocky Mountains.&#160; We also remain committed to building a strong presence in California













 We are focused on improving our operational efficiencies while driving cost and expense reductions.&#160; Absorption has been an historical issue for the company
 and we hope to improve absorption by driving greater volumes through our existing facilities
 which should reduce our costs per unit of production.&#160; We have made considerable efforts to lower costs and expenses as well in areas related to headcount
 salaries and wages
 travel and entertainment













 We are increasingly focused on building our market presence in the Delta (Arkansas and Louisiana) in addition to our traditional focus in the Sacramento Valley region of California.&#160; We recently occupied a 59
800 square foot office
 distribution
 and processing facility in West Sacramento
 CA.&#160; This facility provides us with a food grade building that will help us better meet our customer needs.&#160; We also plan to occupy a new corporate office in The Woodlands
 Texas
 during the second quarter of 2018.&#160; The Woodlands is located near Houston-Bush Intercontinental Airport
 one of the most active airports in the U.S.
 and is a suburb of Houston
 one of the fastest growing SMAs in the U.S.&#160; The Woodlands is about a 2- to 3-hour drive from our existing facilities in Mermentau and Lake Charles
 Louisiana
 and provides us flights of 75 minutes or less to reach most of the key rice milling areas of the Delta states.&#160; The large corporate population &#8211; the Houston SMA is habited by 54 Fortune 1000 companies &#8211; which provides us a large pool of possible employees versed in public company needs.&#160; In addition













 We are focused on extending our proprietary product and process technologies
 finding new products and processes











 outside independent sales representatives and third-party distributors to market our portfolio of products to customers domestically and internationally.&#160; In 2017 and 2016
 three customers accounted for 39% and 40%
 respectively















 we entered into an exclusive supply and cooperation agreement with a Thailand-based entity (Youji) granting us the exclusive worldwide
 with certain exclusions
 supply and distribution rights for their organic rice bran.&#160; In addition




 we entered into a series of agreements with various affiliates of Wilmar International Limited (collectively &#8220;Wilmar).&#160; In connection therewith
 we sold a 50% membership interest in RBT PRO
 LLC (RBT PRO) to Wilmar.&#160; RBT PRO granted an exclusive
 royalty free
 perpetual sublicense of the license to use processes for deriving protein from rice bran to Wilmar for use throughout China and to us for use worldwide




 and under the agreements
 we obtained the right to purchase 45% of the capital stock of any entity Wilmar establishes to develop new products relating to rice bran or its derivatives
 as defined in the agreement
 using the intellectual property licensed to Wilmar.&#160; If we decline the right to purchase 45% of the capital stock of any such new entity
 we have the option to purchase 25% of the entity within two years of the entity&#8217;s formation.&#160; The exercise price for this option will equal 25% of the capital investment made in the entity
 plus interest

 primarily the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)
 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the USDA.&#160; Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are manufactured and sold
 as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States
 such as Brazil (discussed below)
 in which our products are manufactured and sold.&#160; Among other matters
 regulation by the FDA and FTC is concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product&#8217;s ability to provide health-related benefits.&#160; Specifically
 the FDA
 under the Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)
 regulates the formulation

 primarily the FDA and the FTC
 have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them
 including initiating investigations
 issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders
 requiring corrective labeling or advertising
 requiring consumer redress such as requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold
 seeking injunctive relief or product seizures
 imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution.&#160; In addition
 certain state agencies have similar authority.&#160; These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food and food ingredient industries

 which could adversely affect our business
 financial condition
 results of operations














 profitability or positive cash flow
 on either a quarterly or annual basis
 and that profitability
 if achieved
 may not be sustained.&#160; If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability
 we may not be financially viable in the future and may have to curtail
 suspend
 or cease operations
 restructure existing operations to attempt to ensure future viability
 or pursue other alternatives such as re-filing for bankruptcy
 pursuing dissolution and liquidation
 seeking to merge with another company




 and losses in the future could cause the trading price of our stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition




 we have incurred an accumulated deficit in excess of $265 million.&#160; We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations if achieved.&#160; If our losses continue
 our liquidity may continue to be severely impaired
 our stock price may fall and our shareholders may lose all or a significant portion of their investment.&#160; If we are not able to attain profitability in the near future our financial condition could deteriorate further which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of shareholder investment.&#160; Further
 we may be unable to pay our debt obligations as they become due


















 strengthen our financial position or to make acquisitions.&#160; Our board of directors has the ability
 without seeking shareholder approval
 to issue convertible debt and additional shares of common stock or preferred stock that is convertible into common stock for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient
 which may be at a discount to the market price.&#160; Any sales of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in dilution of the equity interests of our existing shareholders
 which could be substantial.&#160; Additionally
 if we issue shares of preferred stock or convertible debt to raise funds
 the holders of those securities might be entitled to various preferential rights over the holders of our common stock
 including repayment of their investment
 and possibly additional amounts
 before any payments could be made to holders of our common stock in connection with an acquisition of us.&#160; Such preferred shares
 if authorized
 might be granted rights and preferences that would be senior to
 or otherwise adversely affect
 the rights and the value of our common stock.&#160; Also








 or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls
 could harm our operating results
 cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements.&#160; Any such failure could
 in turn
 affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective.&#160; Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation




 if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting
 the disclosure of that fact
 even if quickly remedied
 could reduce the market&#8217;s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price.&#160; Furthermore
 deficiencies could result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the 2013 COSO Framework.&#160; Such non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions







 our anticipated share of this market
 the estimated price and acceptance of our products and other factors.&#160; These assumptions are based on our best estimates; however
 our assessments may not prove to be correct.&#160; Any future success may depend upon factors including changes in governmental regulation
 increased levels of competition
 including the entry of additional competitors and increased success by existing competitors
 changes in general economic conditions
 increases in operating costs including costs of rice bran
 production
 supplies
 personnel












 Texas sometime during the second quarter of 2018.&#160; We recognize some of our executive officers and other key decision makers may not relocate to Texas.&#160; We may face significant challenges in relocating our principal executive office to a different state
 including difficulties in retaining and attracting officers
 key personnel and other employees and challenges in maintaining corporate headquarters in a state different from where other employees
 including other executive officers
 corporate support staff and manufacturing facilities
 are located.&#160; Employees may be uncertain about their future roles within our organization as a result of the relocation. Management may also be required to devote substantial time to relocating our corporate headquarters and related matters
 which could otherwise be devoted to focusing on ongoing business operations and other initiatives and opportunities. Any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business

















 we may review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products
 expand the breadth of our markets or enhance technical capabilities
 or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities.&#160; Such acquisitions involve numerous risks
 including

 2017




 viability and financial stability of our customers.&#160; We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues.&#160; Consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues.&#160; This results in a concentration of credit risk with respect to our outstanding accounts receivable.&#160; We consider the financial strength of the customer
 the remoteness of the possible risk that a default event will occur
 the potential benefits to our future growth and development
 possible actions to reduce the likelihood of a default event and the benefits from the transaction before entering into a large credit limit for a customer.&#160; Although we analyze these factors
 the ultimate collection of the obligation from the customer may not occur.&#160; Although we continue to expand our customer base in an attempt to mitigate the concentration of credit risk
 the writing off of an accounts receivable balance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.&#160; Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.&#160; Historically
 we have not experienced any loss of our cash and cash equivalents







 our objective is to protect our profitability
 but also to protect
 to the extent we can
 our ongoing relationships with our distributors and customers.&#160; However
 as part of our credit risk policies
 we occasionally must
 among other things
 cancel
 reduce credit limits and place cash only requirements for certain questionable accounts.&#160; These credit risk policies may negatively impact our relationships with our distributors and customers

 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
 state and local authorities and foreign governmental agencies.&#160; In addition
 the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may negatively impact the marketing of our products
 resulting in significant loss of sales revenues.&#160; Our failure to comply with these current and new regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims








 2017
 the United States enacted significant changes to U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of H.R.1
 &#8220;An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018&#8221; (the Tax Act).&#160;&#160; The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to a maximum of 21 percent.&#160; As of December 31
 2017
 we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act
 however
 in certain cases
 as described below
 we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. The application of this rate reduction to the ending deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities impacted our expense for income taxes by $7.1 million which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance in 2017.&#160; We are still analyzing the Tax Act and refining our calculations
 which could potentially impact the measurement of our tax balances.&#160; The Tax Act contains several base broadening provisions that became effective on January 1
 2018
















 which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage
 product tampering and other adulteration of food products.&#160; We may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury
 illness or death.&#160; We maintain a product liability policy for $5.0 million per year in the aggregate.&#160; In addition
 we may voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage.&#160; A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition.&#160; Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful

 and patents might not be issued or not be broad enough in scope.&#160; We may not be able to protect our technology adequately




 but infringement claims by third parties
 or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims
 could be asserted in the future or that such assertions
 if proven to be accurate
 could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.&#160; In the future
 litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents
 to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.&#160; Any litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of our efforts and other resources
 which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.&#160; Adverse determinations in any litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights
 subjecting us to significant liabilities to third parties
 require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our systems
 any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.&#160; A license under a third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights might not be available to us on reasonable terms








 including the efforts of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.&#160; Although we have written employment agreements with these employees
 such individuals could die
 become disabled or resign.&#160; In addition

Share-based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&#160;&#160; We recognize forfeitures as they occur.&#160; Prior to 2017
 forfeitures were estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&#160; Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards

 we value stock options granted to non-employees and consultants using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model and stock at the fair value of the award.&#160; If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty&#8217;s performance is complete.&#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue
ASU 2014-09

 2016-10
 2016-12. 2016-20
&#160; Under the new guidance
 we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&#160; We have completed our evaluation of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our financial statements and expect adoption will have an immaterial impact on our results of operations
 financial position and cash flows.&#160; A majority of our sales are recognized when control and title transfers under existing standards.&#160; We expect to transition through a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1
 2018
 under the modified retrospective method.&#160; Substantially all of our revenue contracts contain a single performance obligation




 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases
ASU 2016-02

 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&#160; Early adoption is allowed.&#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations

 the $0.5 million as an increase in common stock to record the change in fair value of existing warrants and the remaining $0.4 million to debt
 debt issuance costs and debt discount.&#160; We used the net proceeds from the offering to (i) pay off the senior revolving loan and term loan debt totaling $3.8 million and (ii) pay $0.2 million of principal and $0.3 million of interest due on subordinated notes and (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes.&#160; We filed a registration statement on Form S-3
 which became effective in May 2017







 we entered into agreements which resulted in (i) a reduction in the annual interest rate on the subordinated notes from 11.75%&#160; to 7% (ii) an extension of the maturity date of the subordinated notes&#160; to May 2019 from May 2018 (iii) the payment of an aggregate amount equal to $0.5 million on the subordinated notes; (iv) the issuance of warrants to purchase up to 3
484
675 shares of our common stock (exercise price of&#160; $0.96 per share
 expiration February 2022); and (v) the amendment of existing warrants held by the subordinated note holders for the purchase 289
669 shares of common stock to reduce the exercise price from $5.25 per share to $0.96 per share.&#160; We accounted for the transaction as an extinguishment of debt and issuance of new debt.&#160; In February 2017
 we (i) recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million
 (ii) adjusted subordinated notes payable debt down by $0.9 million
 to its fair value as of the transaction date
 (iii) increased derivative liability by $2.3 million
 representing the fair value of the newly issued warrants







 we amended an agreement with a senior lender to extend the terms of a loan agreement and repriced a previously issued warrant held by the lender from an exercise price per share of $5.25 to $1.85.&#160; In September 2016
 we amended the terms of the loan agreement with the lender to further extend the terms of the loan agreement and repriced the warrant held by the lender from an exercise price per share of $1.85 to $1.60.&#160; Both prior to and subsequent to these modifications
 we recorded the warrant at fair value as a derivative warrant liability
 pursuant to the Share Sequencing







 we entered into a note payable with a director in the principal amount of $0.3 million and issued the director a warrant to acquire 25
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $5.25 per share
 exercisable immediately and expiring in January 2021).&#160; On the date of issuance
 we recorded the warrant at fair value as a derivative warrant liability
 pursuant to the Share Sequencing







 the exercise price of certain warrants that contained full ratchet anti-dilution provisions was reduced from $1.50 per share to $0.96 per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying these warrants increased from 1
489
868 shares to 2
327
919 shares.&#160; The holder of the warrants subsequently exercised the warrants and we issued 614
610 shares of common stock to the holder
 with a weighted average fair value on the dates of conversion of $1.38 per share




















 we issued 950
000 shares of common stock to a supplier.&#160; The shares are being held in escrow until earned (as defined in our agreement) by the supplier at a fixed price of $2.80 per share.&#160; Cumulatively

 the United States enacted significant changes to U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of H.R.1
 &#8220;An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018&#8221; (the Tax Act).&#160;&#160; The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to a maximum of 21 percent.&#160; As of December 31
 2017
 we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act
 however
 in certain cases
 as described below
 we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. The application of this rate reduction to the ending deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities impacted our expense for income taxes by $7.1 million which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance in 2017.&#160; We are still analyzing the Tax Act and refining our calculations
 which could potentially impact the measurement of our tax balances.&#160; The Tax Act contains several base broadening provisions that became effective on January 1

 2017
 and expire at various dates from 2018 through 2037.&#160; We generated a capital loss carryforward of $29.1 million from the redemption of membership interest in Nutra S.A. for which the Company does not expect to realize benefit.&#160; Therefore

 we entered into a triple net lease for approximately 5

 Texas.&#160; We expect to move into the space in the second quarter of 2018.&#160; The initial term of the lease is sixty-five months and rent is abated for the first five months.&#160; Minimum monthly base rents total $0.1 million per year during the initial term of the lease.&#160; We expect to recognize rent expense of $0.1 million per year for base rent

 we periodically enter into employment agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions.&amp;#160; While the maximum amount to which we may be exposed under such agreements cannot be reasonably estimated
 we maintain insurance coverage
 which we believe will effectively mitigate our obligations under these indemnification provisions.&amp;#160; No amounts have been recorded in our financial statements with respect to any obligations under such agreements.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;We have employment contracts with certain officers and key management that include provisions for potential severance payments in the event of without-cause terminations or terminations under certain circumstances after a change in control. In addition
 vesting of outstanding nonvested equity grants would accelerate following a change in control.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In November 2016

 2017



 we entered into a triple net lease for approximately 5
380 square feet of office space in The Woodlands
 Texas.&amp;#160; We expect to move into the space in the second quarter of 2018.&amp;#160; The initial term of the lease is sixty-five months and rent is abated for the first five months.&amp;#160; Minimum monthly base rents total $0.1 million per year during the initial term of the lease.&amp;#160; We expect to recognize rent expense of $0.1 million per year for base rent
 plus additional amounts for operating expenses
 real estate taxes and other items.&amp;#160; We may extend the term of the lease for an additional five-year period at a fair market base rent

 patent and intellectual property claims
 claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations.&amp;#160; When applicable
 we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.&amp;#160; While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty

 we began exploring strategic options for our wholly-owned subsidiary
 HN.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;In July 2017
 we completed the sale of the assets of HN for $18.3 million in cash.&amp;#160; The selling price is subject to adjustment if the estimated closing working capital with respect to the assets sold and the liabilities assumed is different than the actual closing working capital for those assets and liabilities.&amp;#160; The sale agreement contains customary indemnification provisions and provisions that restrict us from engaging in a business conducted by HN for five years from the date of closing.&amp;#160; A $0.2 million working capital adjustment escrow and a $0.6 million indemnity claim escrow were funded from the proceeds and are classified as restricted cash.&amp;#160; We are providing certain support services under transition services agreement for a limited period of time.&amp;#160; These support services are not expected to have a material impact on our net income (loss) in 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;On a preliminary basis

 net of a $4.7 million income tax provision.&amp;#160; The definition of working capital under the agreement is subject to interpretation and we have not yet finalized the adjustment with the purchaser of HN.&amp;#160; The final adjustment may differ from the estimate.&amp;#160; The following table summarizes the carrying amount of HN as of the July 14

 2017
 the United States enacted significant changes to U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of H.R.1
 &amp;#8220;An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018&amp;#8221; (the Tax Act).&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to a maximum of 21 percent.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2017
 we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act
 however
 in certain cases
 as described below
 we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. The application of this rate reduction to the ending deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities impacted our expense for income taxes by $7.1 million which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance in 2017.&amp;#160; We are still analyzing the Tax Act and refining our calculations
 which could potentially impact the measurement of our tax balances.&amp;#160; The Tax Act contains several base broadening provisions that became effective on January 1
 2018

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue

 Revenue: Revenue from Contracts with Customers&lt;/font&gt; (and subsequent guidance to related to the topic in ASUs 2016-08
 2016-10
 2016-12. 2016-20
 and 2017-14)&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: italic;&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160; Under the new guidance
 we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&amp;#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&amp;#160; We have completed our evaluation of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our financial statements and expect adoption will have an immaterial impact on our results of operations
 financial position and cash flows.&amp;#160; A majority of our sales are recognized when control and title transfers under existing standards.&amp;#160; We expect to transition through a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1
 2018
 under the modified retrospective method.&amp;#160; Substantially all of our revenue contracts contain a single performance obligation
 to supply continually defined quantities of product at fixed prices.&amp;#160; Those performance obligations are fulfilled at the time of delivery.&amp;#160; Our revenue contracts generally do not include any other explicit or implicit items that are separate from the product we sell.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases

 Leases.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160; Under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&amp;#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&amp;#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&amp;#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&amp;#160; Early adoption is allowed.&amp;#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations

 the FASB issued guidance that requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents
 &lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: italic;&gt;ASU 2016-18
&amp;#160; Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash&lt;/font&gt;.&amp;#160; We were required to adopt the guidance for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018.&amp;#160; We early adopted the standard in the third quarter of 2017 on a retrospective basis.&amp;#160; As a result

 and recorded $1.2 million as preferred stock.&amp;#160; We recorded a $0.8 million dividend on preferred stock for the preferred stock beneficial conversion feature equal to the proceeds allocated to the preferred stock issued to purchases who did not exchange debt
 as the fair value of the common stock underlying the convertible preferred stock at issuance exceeded the amount recorded in preferred stock.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffff;&gt;In February 2016
 we issued and sold 3
000 shares of Series F preferred stock and sold warrants to purchase 2
660
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $2.00 per share
 exercisable beginning in August 2016 and expiring in August 2021).&amp;#160; The placement agent for the offering received a cash fee of $0.2 million.&amp;#160; The net proceeds from the offering were $2.6 million
 after deducting cash offering expenses of $0.4 million.&amp;#160; On the date of issuance
 we allocated $2.5 million of the $3.0 million gross proceeds to derivative warrant liability
 to record the warrants at fair value and recorded the remaining $0.5 million proceeds as preferred stock.&amp;#160; We recorded a dividend on preferred stock for the preferred stock beneficial conversion feature equal to the proceeds allocated to the preferred stock at issuance ($0.5 million)
 as the fair value of the common stock underlying the convertible preferred stock at issuance was $2.7 million.&amp;#160; As a result of this offering
 the exercise price of certain warrants that contained full ratchet anti-dilution provisions was reduced from $5.24 per share to $1.50 per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying these warrants increased from 426
489 shares to 1
489

 we sold and issued in a private placement
 for an aggregate subscription amount of $6.0 million: (i) senior debentures in the principal amount of $6.6 million and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6
875
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $0.96 per share
 exercisable beginning February 2017 and expiration February 2022).&amp;#160; We received aggregate net proceeds of $5.5 million
 after deducting placement agent fees and allocated expenses of $0.5 million.&amp;#160; Concurrently
 we amended existing warrants
 held by the debenture purchasers
 for the purchase of up to 875
000 shares to (i) reduce the exercise prices from an average $5.49 per share to $0.96 per share
 providing the warrants are not exercisable until August 2017
 and (ii) change the expiration dates to August 2022
 which increased the average remaining term of the warrants from 2.1 years to 5.5 years.&amp;#160; We recorded $4.6 million as an increase to derivative warrant liabilities
 to record the warrants at their fair value on the date of issuance
 the $0.5 million as an increase in common stock to record the change in fair value of existing warrants and the remaining $0.4 million to debt
 debt issuance costs and debt discount.&amp;#160; We used the net proceeds from the offering to (i) pay off the senior revolving loan and term loan debt totaling $3.8 million and (ii) pay $0.2 million of principal and $0.3 million of interest due on subordinated notes and (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes.&amp;#160; We filed a registration statement on Form S-3
 which became effective in May 2017

 we entered into agreements which resulted in (i) a reduction in the annual interest rate on the subordinated notes from 11.75%&amp;#160; to 7% (ii) an extension of the maturity date of the subordinated notes&amp;#160; to May 2019 from May 2018 (iii) the payment of an aggregate amount equal to $0.5 million on the subordinated notes; (iv) the issuance of warrants to purchase up to 3
484
675 shares of our common stock (exercise price of&amp;#160; $0.96 per share
 expiration February 2022); and (v) the amendment of existing warrants held by the subordinated note holders for the purchase 289
669 shares of common stock to reduce the exercise price from $5.25 per share to $0.96 per share.&amp;#160; We accounted for the transaction as an extinguishment of debt and issuance of new debt.&amp;#160; In February 2017
 we (i) recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million
 (ii) adjusted subordinated notes payable debt down by $0.9 million
 to its fair value as of the transaction date
 (iii) increased derivative liability by $2.3 million
 representing the fair value of the newly issued warrants

 we amended an agreement with a senior lender to extend the terms of a loan agreement and repriced a previously issued warrant held by the lender from an exercise price per share of $5.25 to $1.85.&amp;#160; In September 2016
 we amended the terms of the loan agreement with the lender to further extend the terms of the loan agreement and repriced the warrant held by the lender from an exercise price per share of $1.85 to $1.60.&amp;#160; Both prior to and subsequent to these modifications
 we recorded the warrant at fair value as a derivative warrant liability
 pursuant to the Share Sequencing

 we entered into a note payable with a director in the principal amount of $0.3 million and issued the director a warrant to acquire 25
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $5.25 per share
 exercisable immediately and expiring in January 2021).&amp;#160; On the date of issuance
 we recorded the warrant at fair value as a derivative warrant liability
 pursuant to the Share Sequencing

 the exercise price of certain warrants that contained full ratchet anti-dilution provisions was reduced from $1.50 per share to $0.96 per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying these warrants increased from 1
489
868 shares to 2
327
919 shares.&amp;#160; The holder of the warrants subsequently exercised the warrants and we issued 614
610 shares of common stock to the holder
 with a weighted average fair value on the dates of conversion of $1.38 per share

 we issued 950
000 shares of common stock to a supplier.&amp;#160; The shares are being held in escrow until earned (as defined in our agreement) by the supplier at a fixed price of $2.80 per share.&amp;#160; Cumulatively
 as of December 31
 2017
 59
292 shares have been released from escrow.&amp;#160; We may recall any shares remaining in escrow as of February 8
 2026.&amp;#160; Any recalled shares will be cancelled.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In February 2017

 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&amp;#160; Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value

 we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment.&amp;#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&amp;#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
 or is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized only when the sales cycle is complete and payment is either received or becomes reasonably assured.&amp;#160; Changes in judgments and estimates regarding the application of the above mentioned four criteria might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized by such transactions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;We make provisions for estimated returns

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue

 Revenue: Revenue from Contracts with Customers&lt;/font&gt; (and subsequent guidance to related to the topic in ASUs 2016-08
 2016-10
 2016-12. 2016-20
 and 2017-14)&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: italic;&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160; Under the new guidance
 we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&amp;#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&amp;#160; We have completed our evaluation of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our financial statements and expect adoption will have an immaterial impact on our results of operations
 financial position and cash flows.&amp;#160; A majority of our sales are recognized when control and title transfers under existing standards.&amp;#160; We expect to transition through a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1
 2018
 under the modified retrospective method.&amp;#160; Substantially all of our revenue contracts contain a single performance obligation
 to supply continually defined quantities of product at fixed prices.&amp;#160; Those performance obligations are fulfilled at the time of delivery.&amp;#160; Our revenue contracts generally do not include any other explicit or implicit items that are separate from the product we sell.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases

 Leases.&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160; Under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&amp;#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&amp;#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&amp;#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&amp;#160; Early adoption is allowed.&amp;#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations

 the FASB issued guidance that requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents
 &lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: italic;&gt;ASU 2016-18
&amp;#160; Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash&lt;/font&gt;.&amp;#160; We were required to adopt the guidance for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018.&amp;#160; We early adopted the standard in the third quarter of 2017 on a retrospective basis.&amp;#160; As a result

 &#8211; The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. Dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities
 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates
 &#8211; We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&#160; In all periods presented
 &#8211; Accounts receivable represent amounts receivable on trade accounts.&#160; The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable.&#160; We analyze the aging of customer accounts
 customer concentrations
 customer credit-worthiness
 current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160; From period to period
In our continuing operations
 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method and we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels
We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
 &#8211; In our continuing operations
 we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment.&#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
We make provisions for estimated returns
 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&#160; Revenues are net of provisions for estimated returns

 bonuses and incentives
 share-based compensation expense
 employee-related expenses
 facility-related expenses

Share-based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&#160;&#160; We recognize forfeitures as they occur.&#160; Prior to 2017
 forfeitures were estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&#160; Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards
For awards of nonvested stock
For restricted stock units
We account for share-based compensation awards granted to non-employees and consultants by determining the fair value of the awards granted at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measured.&#160; Generally
 we value stock options granted to non-employees and consultants using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model and stock at the fair value of the award.&#160; If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty&#8217;s performance is complete.&#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#160; Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.&#160; A valuation allowance is established
 when necessary
 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts
The following represent the standards not yet adopted that will
 or are expected to
In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue
ASU 2014-09

 2016-10
 2016-12. 2016-20
&#160; Under the new guidance
 we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&#160; We have completed our evaluation of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our financial statements and expect adoption will have an immaterial impact on our results of operations
 financial position and cash flows.&#160; A majority of our sales are recognized when control and title transfers under existing standards.&#160; We expect to transition through a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1
 2018
 under the modified retrospective method.&#160; Substantially all of our revenue contracts contain a single performance obligation
In February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases
ASU 2016-02

 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&#160; Early adoption is allowed.&#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations
In November 2016
 the FASB issued guidance that requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents


 changes in restricted cash reported in 2016 as cash flows from investing activities are no longer reported as such.

 WARRANTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS [Abstract]




EQUITY

 WARRANTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS
NOTE 9. EQUITY
 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
In February 2017
 shareholders approved and we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation increasing our authorized shares of common stock from 25
000
000 to 50
000
Our board of directors
 without further action or vote by holders of our common stock
 has the right to establish the terms
 preference
 rights and restrictions and issue shares of preferred stock.&#160; We previously designated and issued six series of preferred stock of which no shares remain outstanding.&#160; In addition
 we have designated and issued a seventh series of preferred stock: 2
000 shares of Series G in 2017
The Series G preferred stock is non-voting and may be converted into shares of our common stock at the holders&#8217; election at any time
 subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations
 at a ratio of 1 preferred share for 948.9915 shares of common stock.&#160; The Series G preferred stock is entitled to receive dividends if we pay dividends on our common stock
 in which case the holders of Series G preferred stock are entitled to receive the amount and form of dividends that they would have received if they held the common stock that is issuable upon conversion of the Series G preferred stock.&#160; If we are liquidated or dissolved
 the holders of Series G preferred stock are entitled to receive
 before any amounts are paid in respect of our common stock
 an amount per share of Series G preferred stock equal to $1
000
Series F preferred stock is no longer outstanding.&#160; The Series F preferred stock was non-voting and could be converted into shares of our common stock at the holder&#8217;s election at any time
 subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations
 at a ratio of 1 preferred share for 666.66666 shares of common stock.&#160; The Series F preferred stock was only entitled to receive dividends if we declared dividends
 in which case the dividend was to be paid (i) first an amount equal to $0.01 per share of preferred stock and (ii) then to and in the same form as dividends paid on shares of our common stock.&#160; Otherwise
Share-based compensation expenses related to stock options
 stock and restricted stock units issued to employees and directors are included in selling
Common stock
1
From June 2015 until March 2017
 the minority interest holders in Nutra SA could elect 
 the number of common stock and warrants issuable upon this election
 was variable and indeterminate.&#160; For accounting purposes
 we were not able to conclude that we had sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle all contracts subject to the GAAP derivative guidance during the period the minority interest holders had this right
 which right terminated March 31
 2017.&#160; Our adopted sequencing approach (Share Sequencing) was based on earliest issuance date
 therefore
 we were required to carry warrants issued between June 2015 and March 2017
 at fair value
 as derivative warrant liability
issued between June 2015 and March 2017

 2017
 and we reclassified the amounts related to the 3
000 shares of Series F preferred stock and 2
000 shares of Series G preferred stock from temporary equity to equity at the preferred stocks&#8217; carrying amount on March 31

Includes a warrant for the purchase of up to purchase 300

 in the event we issue warrants and/or other convertible instruments with anti-dilution provisions with respect to the exercise price of the warrant or the conversion price of the convertible instrument
 we will be required to provide the same anti-dilution provision in this warrant and may be required to lower the exercise price on this warrant and/or increase the number of shares underlying this warrant.&#160; The warrant also contains a provision in effect until November 2017 which gave the holder the right to demand a net cash settlement in the event of a fundamental transaction (as defined in the agreement).&#160; The warrant was classified as derivative warrant liability in our balance sheets due to that provision as of December 31

The warrants were classified as derivative warrant liabilities in our balance sheets due to the Share Sequencing as of December 31

Under the terms of certain outstanding warrants
 the holders may elect to exercise the warrants under a cashless exercise feature.&#160; The shares listed
 represent the shares holders could exercise cashless as of December 31
 2017.&#160; If we register for resale the shares subject to warrants
 the holders of some of the warrants may no longer have the right to elect a cashless exercise.&#160; Should we fail to maintain a registration statement for the resale of shares under certain other warrant

In the period from January 1
 2018 to March 8
 2018
 we issued warrants for the purchase of up to 315
000 shares of common stock
 at a weighted average exercise price of $4.73 per share and a weighted average term of 2.4 years.&#160; We recognized $0.1 million of expense for these issuances.&#160; During the same period
 warrant holders exercised
 at $0.96 per share
 warrants for the purchase of 67
395 shares of common stock (remaining term at December 31
In February 2017
 we issued and sold 2
000 shares of Series G preferred stock and sold warrants to purchase 1
423
488 shares of common stock (exercise price of $0.96 per share
 exercisable beginning in February 2017 and expiring in February 2022).&#160; A subordinated note holder exchanged subordinated notes with a principal and carrying value of $0.1 million and cash for 180 shares of the Series G preferred stock and related warrants
 which was treated as an extinguishment of debt.&#160; The net cash proceeds from the sale was $1.7 million
 after deducting allocated cash offering expenses of $0.1 million.&#160; On the date of issuance
 we allocated $1.0 million of the proceeds to derivative warrant liability
 to record the warrants at fair value
 recorded a $0.1 million loss on extinguishment and reduced debt $0.1 million related to the subordinated noteholders exchange
 and recorded $1.2 million as preferred stock.&#160; We recorded a $0.8 million dividend on preferred stock for the preferred stock beneficial conversion feature equal to the proceeds allocated to the preferred stock issued to purchases who did not exchange debt
In February 2016
 we issued and sold 3
000 shares of Series F preferred stock and sold warrants to purchase 2
660
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $2.00 per share
 exercisable beginning in August 2016 and expiring in August 2021).&#160; The placement agent for the offering received a cash fee of $0.2 million.&#160; The net proceeds from the offering were $2.6 million
 after deducting cash offering expenses of $0.4 million.&#160; On the date of issuance
 we allocated $2.5 million of the $3.0 million gross proceeds to derivative warrant liability
 to record the warrants at fair value and recorded the remaining $0.5 million proceeds as preferred stock.&#160; We recorded a dividend on preferred stock for the preferred stock beneficial conversion feature equal to the proceeds allocated to the preferred stock at issuance ($0.5 million)
 as the fair value of the common stock underlying the convertible preferred stock at issuance was $2.7 million.&#160; As a result of this offering
 the exercise price of certain warrants that contained full ratchet anti-dilution provisions was reduced from $5.24 per share to $1.50 per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying these warrants increased from 426
489 shares to 1
489
In February 2017
 we sold and issued in a private placement
 for an aggregate subscription amount of $6.0 million: (i) senior debentures in the principal amount of $6.6 million and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6
875
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $0.96 per share
 exercisable beginning February 2017 and expiration February 2022).&#160; We received aggregate net proceeds of $5.5 million
 after deducting placement agent fees and allocated expenses of $0.5 million.&#160; Concurrently
 we amended existing warrants
 held by the debenture purchasers
 for the purchase of up to 875
000 shares to (i) reduce the exercise prices from an average $5.49 per share to $0.96 per share
 providing the warrants are not exercisable until August 2017
 and (ii) change the expiration dates to August 2022
 which increased the average remaining term of the warrants from 2.1 years to 5.5 years.&#160; We recorded $4.6 million as an increase to derivative warrant liabilities
 to record the warrants at their fair value on the date of issuance
 the $0.5 million as an increase in common stock to record the change in fair value of existing warrants and the remaining $0.4 million to debt
 debt issuance costs and debt discount.&#160; We used the net proceeds from the offering to (i) pay off the senior revolving loan and term loan debt totaling $3.8 million and (ii) pay $0.2 million of principal and $0.3 million of interest due on subordinated notes and (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes.&#160; We filed a registration statement on Form S-3
 which became effective in May 2017
In connection with the February 2017 senior debenture private placement
 we entered into agreements which resulted in (i) a reduction in the annual interest rate on the subordinated notes from 11.75%&#160; to 7% (ii) an extension of the maturity date of the subordinated notes&#160; to May 2019 from May 2018 (iii) the payment of an aggregate amount equal to $0.5 million on the subordinated notes; (iv) the issuance of warrants to purchase up to 3
484
675 shares of our common stock (exercise price of&#160; $0.96 per share
 expiration February 2022); and (v) the amendment of existing warrants held by the subordinated note holders for the purchase 289
669 shares of common stock to reduce the exercise price from $5.25 per share to $0.96 per share.&#160; We accounted for the transaction as an extinguishment of debt and issuance of new debt.&#160; In February 2017
 we (i) recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million
 (ii) adjusted subordinated notes payable debt down by $0.9 million
 to its fair value as of the transaction date
 (iii) increased derivative liability by $2.3 million
 representing the fair value of the newly issued warrants
In June 2016
 we amended an agreement with a senior lender to extend the terms of a loan agreement and repriced a previously issued warrant held by the lender from an exercise price per share of $5.25 to $1.85.&#160; In September 2016
 we amended the terms of the loan agreement with the lender to further extend the terms of the loan agreement and repriced the warrant held by the lender from an exercise price per share of $1.85 to $1.60.&#160; Both prior to and subsequent to these modifications
 we recorded the warrant at fair value as a derivative warrant liability
 pursuant to the Share Sequencing
In January 2016
 we entered into a note payable with a director in the principal amount of $0.3 million and issued the director a warrant to acquire 25
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $5.25 per share
 exercisable immediately and expiring in January 2021).&#160; On the date of issuance
 we recorded the warrant at fair value as a derivative warrant liability
 pursuant to the Share Sequencing
As a result of the February 2017 financing transactions described above
 the exercise price of certain warrants that contained full ratchet anti-dilution provisions was reduced from $1.50 per share to $0.96 per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying these warrants increased from 1
489
868 shares to 2
327
919 shares.&#160; The holder of the warrants subsequently exercised the warrants and we issued 614
610 shares of common stock to the holder
 with a weighted average fair value on the dates of conversion of $1.38 per share
In February 2016
 we issued 950
000 shares of common stock to a supplier.&#160; The shares are being held in escrow until earned (as defined in our agreement) by the supplier at a fixed price of $2.80 per share.&#160; Cumulatively

On December 22
 2017
 the United States enacted significant changes to U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of H.R.1
 &#8220;An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018&#8221; (the Tax Act).&#160;&#160; The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to a maximum of 21 percent.&#160; As of December 31
 2017
 we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act
 however
 in certain cases
 as described below
 we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. The application of this rate reduction to the ending deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities impacted our expense for income taxes by $7.1 million which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance in 2017.&#160; We are still analyzing the Tax Act and refining our calculations
 which could potentially impact the measurement of our tax balances.&#160; The Tax Act contains several base broadening provisions that became effective on January 1

 2017
 and expire at various dates from 2018 through 2037.&#160; We generated a capital loss carryforward of $29.1 million from the redemption of membership interest in Nutra S.A. for which the Company does not expect to realize benefit.&#160; Therefore
 a valuation allowance has been recorded as of December 31
We experienced several ownership changes as defined in IRC Section 382(g) as a result of offerings and conversions that occurred in 2013 and 2014 and a new shareholder obtaining a greater than 5% interest in the value our equity in September 2017.&#160; Our ability to utilize previously accumulated net operating loss carryforwards was subject to substantial annual limitations due to change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions.&#160; We record liabilities for income tax contingencies based on our best estimate of the underlying exposures.&#160; We are open for audit by the IRS for years after 2013 and

In the normal course of business
 we periodically enter into employment agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions.&#160; While the maximum amount to which we may be exposed under such agreements cannot be reasonably estimated
 we maintain insurance coverage
We have employment contracts with certain officers and key management that include provisions for potential severance payments in the event of without-cause terminations or terminations under certain circumstances after a change in control. In addition
In November 2016
 we entered into an agreement settling matters with our former chief executive officer related to his separation of employment and termination from our board of directors in November 2016.&#160; Pursuant to this agreement we paid the former executive severance of $0.3 million in 2016
Future minimum payments under these commitments as of December 31

In March 2018
 we entered into a triple net lease for approximately 5
380 square feet of office space in The Woodlands
 Texas.&#160; We expect to move into the space in the second quarter of 2018.&#160; The initial term of the lease is sixty-five months and rent is abated for the first five months.&#160; Minimum monthly base rents total $0.1 million per year during the initial term of the lease.&#160; We expect to recognize rent expense of $0.1 million per year for base rent
 plus additional amounts for operating expenses
 real estate taxes and other items.&#160; We may extend the term of the lease for an additional five-year period at a fair market base rent
From time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business.&#160; These matters may relate to employment and labor claims
 patent and intellectual property claims
 claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations.&#160; When applicable
 we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.&#160; While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty
 in the opinion of management
 individually or in the aggregate
 no such lawsuits are expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.&#160; Defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in professional fees.

Under the January 31
 2008
 purchase agreement related to the purchase of Irgovel
 we deposited $2.0 million into an escrow account to cover contingencies.&#160; On March 24
 2016
 the $1.9 million in the escrow account was released to us to fund an award owed to us by the sellers of Irgovel.&#160; We recognized a gain of $1.6 million in 2016
 equal to the difference between the $1.9 million escrow liability and the $0.3 million of resolved pre-acquisition contingencies specifically identified and accrued.&#160; As required under an agreement with a lender
 we used part of the proceeds to pay $1.0 million of a senior term loan.&#160;

 &#8211; The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. Dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.&#160; Actual results may differ from those estimates.&#160; The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RiceBran Technologies and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest.&#160; All significant inter-company balances are eliminated in consolidation.&#160; Variable interest in subsidiaries for which we are the primary beneficiary are consolidated.&#160; Noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries are recorded net of tax as net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.




 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates
 actual results could differ from those estimates.









 &#8211; We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&#160; In all periods presented
 we maintained our cash and cash equivalents with major banks.&#160; We maintain cash in bank accounts in amounts which at times may exceed federally insured limits.&#160; We have not experienced any losses on such accounts.




 &#8211; Accounts receivable represent amounts receivable on trade accounts.&#160; The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable.&#160; We analyze the aging of customer accounts
 customer concentrations
 customer credit-worthiness
 current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160; From period to period
 differences in judgments or estimates utilized may result in material differences in the amount and timing of the provision for doubtful accounts.&#160; We periodically evaluate our credit policy to ensure that the customers are worthy of terms and support our business plans.




In our continuing operations
 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method and we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels
 historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts; while inventory determined to be obsolete is written off immediately.




We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
 less estimated costs to sell.




 &#8211; In our continuing operations
 we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment.&#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
We make provisions for estimated returns
 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&#160; Revenues are net of provisions for estimated returns
 routine sales discounts
 volume allowances and adjustments.&#160; Revenues are also net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.



Selling
 General and Administrative Expenses
Selling

 general and administrative expenses include salaries and wages
 bonuses and incentives
 share-based compensation expense
 employee-related expenses
 facility-related expenses
 marketing and advertising expense
 depreciation of non-operating property and equipment
 professional fees
 amortization of intangible assets
 provisions for losses on accounts receivable and other operating expenses.









Share-based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&#160;&#160; We recognize forfeitures as they occur.&#160; Prior to 2017
 forfeitures were estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&#160; Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards
For awards of nonvested stock
For restricted stock units
We account for share-based compensation awards granted to non-employees and consultants by determining the fair value of the awards granted at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measured.&#160; Generally
 we value stock options granted to non-employees and consultants using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model and stock at the fair value of the award.&#160; If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty&#8217;s performance is complete.&#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance
 the entire amount is expensed.&#160; The value is re-measured each reporting period over the requisite service period.




Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#160; Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.&#160; A valuation allowance is established
 when necessary
 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts
 the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined that the liabilities are no longer necessary.




The following represent the standards not yet adopted that will
 or are expected to
In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue
ASU 2014-09

 2016-10
 2016-12. 2016-20
&#160; Under the new guidance
 we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&#160; We have completed our evaluation of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our financial statements and expect adoption will have an immaterial impact on our results of operations
 financial position and cash flows.&#160; A majority of our sales are recognized when control and title transfers under existing standards.&#160; We expect to transition through a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1
 2018
 under the modified retrospective method.&#160; Substantially all of our revenue contracts contain a single performance obligation
In February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases
ASU 2016-02

 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&#160; Early adoption is allowed.&#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations
In November 2016
 the FASB issued guidance that requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents


 changes in restricted cash reported in 2016 as cash flows from investing activities are no longer reported as such.

Disclosure of accounting policy for revenue recognition. If the entity has different policies for different types of revenue transactions
 the policy for each material type of transaction is generally disclosed. If a sales transaction has multiple element arrangements (for example
 delivery of multiple products
 services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for inclusion of significant items in the selling
 general and administrative (or similar) expense report caption.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for director stock option and stock incentive plans. This disclosure may include (1) the types of director stock option or incentive plans sponsored by the entity (2) significant plan provisions and (3) how stock compensation is measured

Includes a warrant for the purchase of up to purchase 300
000 shares of common stock which contains a most favored nations anti-dilution provision.&#160; Under that provision
 in the event we issue warrants and/or other convertible instruments with anti-dilution provisions with respect to the exercise price of the warrant or the conversion price of the convertible instrument
 we will be required to provide the same anti-dilution provision in this warrant and may be required to lower the exercise price on this warrant and/or increase the number of shares underlying this warrant.&#160; The warrant also contains a provision in effect until November 2017 which gave the holder the right to demand a net cash settlement in the event of a fundamental transaction (as defined in the agreement).&#160; The warrant was classified as derivative warrant liability in our balance sheets due to that provision as of December 31
 2016

Under the terms of certain outstanding warrants
 the holders may elect to exercise the warrants under a cashless exercise feature.&#160; The shares listed

 the holders of some of the warrants may no longer have the right to elect a cashless exercise.&#160; Should we fail to maintain a registration statement for the resale of shares under certain other warrant
 the shares under those warrants may be exercisable using a cashless exercise feature.

Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.
