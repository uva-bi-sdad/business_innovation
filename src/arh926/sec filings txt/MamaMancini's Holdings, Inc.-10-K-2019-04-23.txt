Our
History

MamaMancini&rsquo;s
Holdings
 Inc. (formerly Mascot Properties
 Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 22
 2009. Mascot Properties
Inc.&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Mascot&rdquo;) activities since its inception consisted of trying to locate real estate properties to manage
primarily related to student housing
 and services which included general property management
 maintenance and activities coordination
for residents. Mascot did not have any significant development of such business and did not derive any revenue. Due to the lack
of results in its attempt to implement its original business plan
 management determined it was in the best interests of the shareholders
to look for other potential business opportunities.

On
February 22
 2010
 MamaMancini&rsquo;s LLC was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of New Jersey
in order to commercialize our initial products. On March 5
 2012
 the members of MamaMancini&rsquo;s
 LLC
 holders of 4
700 units
(the &ldquo;Units&rdquo;) of MamaMancini&rsquo;s LLC
 exchanged the Units for 15
000
000 shares of common stock and those certain
options to purchase an additional 223
404 shares of MamaMancini&rsquo;s Inc. (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;). Upon consummation of
the Exchange
 MamaMancini&rsquo;s LLC ceased to exist and all further business has been and continues to be conducted by MamaMancini&rsquo;s
Inc.

On
January 24
 2013
 Mascot
 Mascot Properties Acquisition Corp
 a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
(&ldquo;Merger Sub&rdquo;)
 MamaMancini&rsquo;s Inc.
 a privately-held Delaware Corporation headquartered in New Jersey (&ldquo;Mama&rsquo;s&rdquo;)
and David Dreslin
 an individual (the &ldquo;Majority Shareholder&rdquo;)
 entered into an Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) pursuant to which the Merger Sub was merged with and into Mama&rsquo;s
 with Mama&rsquo;s surviving
as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the &ldquo;Merger&rdquo;). The transaction (the &ldquo;Closing&rdquo;) took place
on January 24
 2013 (the &ldquo;Closing Date&rdquo;). Mascot acquired
 through a reverse triangular merger
 all of the outstanding
capital stock of Mama&rsquo;s in exchange for issuing Mama&rsquo;s shareholders (the &ldquo;Mama&rsquo;s Shareholders&rdquo;)
pro-rata
 a total of 20
054
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. As a result of the Merger
 the Mama&rsquo;s Shareholders
became the majority shareholders of Mascot.

Immediately
following the Closing of the Agreement
 Mascot changed its business plan to that of Mama&rsquo;s. On March 8
 2013
 Mascot received
notice from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) that its application to change its name and symbol
had been approved and effective Monday
 March 11
 2013
 Mascot began trading under its new name
 &ldquo;MamaMancini&rsquo;s Holdings
Inc.&rdquo; (&ldquo;MamaMancini&rsquo;s&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) and under its new symbol
 &ldquo;MMMB&rdquo;.


    
    


On
November 1
 2017
 MamaMancini&rsquo;s
 Joseph Epstein Food Enterprises
 Inc.
 a New Jersey corporation (&ldquo;JEFE&rdquo;)
 and
MMMB Acquisition
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of MamaMancini&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Merger Sub&rdquo;)
 completed
a merger transaction whereby JEFE merged with and into Merger Sub
 with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly
owned subsidiary of MamaMancini&rsquo;s. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement and in connection with the merger
 the Company
acquired all assets of JEFE. The consideration for the transaction was (a) the extinguishment of the Inter-Company Loan between
the parties
 (b) the assumption by the Company of all JEFE accounts payable and accrued expenses (c) assumption by the Company
of certain third-party loans to JEFE totaling approximately $782
000 and (d) indemnification of Carl Wolf with respect to his
collateralization of a bank loan to JEFE in the amount of approximately $250
000. As a result of the transaction
 (i) the Company
became the sole shareholder of JEFE
 which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. No cash or stock was exchanged in
connection with the transaction.

Our
Company

MamaMancini&rsquo;s
roots go back to our founder Dan Dougherty
 whose grandmother Anna &ldquo;Mama&rdquo; Mancini emigrated from Bari
 Italy to Bay
Ridge
 Brooklyn in 1921. Our products were developed using her old world Italian recipes that were handed down to her grandson
Dan Dougherty. Today we market a line of all-natural specialty prepared
 frozen and refrigerated foods for sale in retailers around
the country. Our primary products include beef
 turkey
 chicken and pork meatballs
 all with slow cooked Italian Sauce.

Our
products are all natural
 contain a minimum number of ingredients and are generally derived from the original recipes of Anna
&ldquo;Mama&rdquo; Mancini. Our products appeal to health-conscious consumers who seek to avoid artificial flavors
 synthetic
colors and preservatives that are used in many conventional packaged foods.

The
United States Department of Agriculture (the &ldquo;USDA&rdquo;) defines all natural as a product that contains no artificial
ingredients
 coloring ingredients or chemical preservatives and is minimally processed. The Company&rsquo;s products were submitted
to the USDA and approved as all natural. The Food and Safety and Inspection Service (&ldquo;FSIS&rdquo;) Food Standards and Labeling
Policy Book (2003) requires meat and poultry labels to include a brief statement directly beneath or beside the &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
Label claim that &ldquo;explains what is meant by the term natural i.e.
 that the product is a natural food because it contains
no artificial ingredients and is only minimally processed&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;natural&rdquo; may be used on a meat label or
poultry label if the product does not contain any artificial flavor or flavoring
 coloring ingredient
 chemical preservative
or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient. Additionally
 the term &ldquo;all natural&rdquo; can be used if the FSIS approves
your product and label claims. The Company&rsquo;s product and label claims have been approved by the FSIS to contain the all-natural
label.

Our
products are principally sold to supermarkets and mass-market retailers. We currently have 26 different product offerings which
are packaged in different sized retail and bulk packages. Our products are principally sold in multiple sections of the supermarket
including: hot bars
 salad bars
 prepared foods (meals)
 sandwich
 as well as cold deli and foods-to-go sections. Our products
are also sold in the frozen food and fresh meat sections. We sell directly to both food retailers and food distributors.

Finally
we also sell our products on QVC through live on-air offerings
 auto ship programs and for every day purchases on their web site.
QVC is the world&rsquo;s largest direct to consumer marketer.


    
    


During
the year ended January 31
 2019
 the Company earned revenues from two customers representing approximately 50% and 10% of gross
sales. During the year ended January 31
 2018
 the Company earned revenues from two customers representing approximately 40% and
10% of gross sales. As of January 31
 2019
 three customers represented approximately 44%
 19% and 13% of total gross outstanding
receivables
 respectively. As of January 31
 2018
 two customers represented approximately 43% and 15% of total gross outstanding
receivables
 respectively. We depend heavily on these customers.

The
Company continually reviews its accounts in order to focus on maximum performance
 and as a result periodically
eliminates under-performing accounts.

Industry
Overview

Our
products are considered specialty prepared foods
 in that they are all natural
 taste great
 are authentic Italian and are made
with high quality ingredients. The market for specialty and prepared foods spans several sections of the supermarket
 including
frozen
 deli- prepared foods
 and the specialty meat segment of the meat department.

Our
Strengths

We
believe that the following strengths differentiate our products and our brand:



    
    
Authentic
Our products are founded upon Anna &ldquo;Mama&rdquo; Mancini&rsquo;s old-world Italian
    recipes. We believe the authenticity of our products has enabled us to build and maintain loyalty and trust among our current
    customers and will help us attract new customers. Additionally
 we continuously receive positive customer testimonials regarding
    the great taste and quality of our products.

    
    
    

    
    
Healthy
Our products are made only from high quality natural ingredients
 including domestic inspected beef
    whole Italian tomatoes
 genuine imported Pecorino Romano
 real eggs
 natural breadcrumbs
 olive oil and other herbs and spices.
    Our products are also simple to prepare. Virtually every product we offer is ready-to-serve within 12 minutes
 thereby providing
    quick and easy meal solutions for our customers. By including the sauce and utilizing a tray with our packaging
 our meatballs
    can be prepared quickly and easily.

    
    
    

    
    
Great
We strive to provide our customers with a great tasting product using all-natural ingredients at an
    affordable price. Typical retail prices for 16 oz. packages ranges from $4.99 to $7.99
 and $5.99 to $9.99 for bulk products
    sold in delis or hot bars. We believe the sizes of our product offerings represent a great value for the price.

    
    
    

    
    
New
Since our inception
 we have continued to introduce new and innovative products. While we
    pride on ourselves on our traditional beef
 turkey
 chicken and pork meatballs
 we have continuously made efforts to grow
    and diversify our line of products while maintaining our high standards for all natural
 healthy ingredients and great taste.
    New items introduced in the last two years include:

Strong
Many of our consumers are loyal and enthusiastic brand advocates. Our consumers trust us to deliver
    great-tasting products made with all-natural ingredients. Consumers have actively communicated with us through our website
    and/or social media channels. We believe that this consumer interaction has generated interest in our products and has inspired
    enthusiasm for our brand. We also believe that enthusiasm for our products has led and will continue to lead to repeat purchases
    and new consumers trying our products.

    
    
    

    
    
Experienced
We have a proven and experienced senior management team. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
 Carl
    Wolf
 has been with us since inception and has over 35 years of experience in the management and operations of food companies.
    Mr. Wolf was the founder
 majority shareholder
 Chairman of the Board
 and CEO of Alpine Lace Brands
 Inc.
 a public company
    engaged in the development
 marketing and distribution of cheese
 deli meats and other specialty food products
 which was
    sold to Land O&rsquo;Lakes
 Inc. In addition
 the other members of our board of directors also have significant experience
    in the food industry.


Our
Growth Strategy

We
are actively executing a strategy to build our brand&rsquo;s reputation
 grow sales and improve our product and operating margins
by pursuing the following growth initiatives:



    
    
Increase
. We strive for product placements in the perishable departments
    of retail locations. We believe adding shelf placements within the supermarkets that carry our products will increase customer
    awareness
 leading to more consumers purchasing our products and expanding our market share.

    
    
    

    
    
Increase
. Increase sales in the &ldquo;Fresh&rdquo; section (in the perimeter of the retainer)
    where there is significant sales growth and higher margins
 over products in the &ldquo;Frozen&rdquo; section which are showing
    zero to negative growth.

    
    
    

    
    
Increase
. We intend to increase sales by expanding the number of retail
                                         stores that sell our products in the mainstream grocery and mass merchandiser channels.
        

    
    
Increase
. We have an experienced sales staff and now employ one full time Vice President of Sales as well as
    our Co-Founder Dan Dougherty
 Carl Wolf
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
 and Matthew Brown
 our President
 each
    of whom is involved with selling to
 and managing sales with
 major supermarket chains.

    
    
    

    
    
Expand
. We currently work with retail food brokers nationwide and intend to add additional food brokers
    to increase our geographical coverage in the United States to approximately 90%.

    
    
    

    
    
Enhance
. We have increased our social media activity with Facebook
 Twitter
 Pinterest
 and YouTube.
    We also engage with consumers through newsletter mailings
 blogs
 and special projects
 including a bank of recipe videos
    and contests and giveaways. Targeted consumer merchandising activity
 including virtual couponing
 on-pack couponing
 mail-in
    rebates
 product demonstrations
 and co-op retail advertising will continue into the future in order to increase sales and
    generate new customers.

    
    
    

    
    
Adding
. Our market research and consumer testing enable us to identify attractive new product opportunities.
    We intend to continue to introduce new products in both existing and new product lines that appeal to a wide range of consumers.
    

    
    
    

    
    
Maintain
. The Company currently offers various lines through QVC and intends to increase its
    product line offerings offered through QVC.

    
    
    

    
    
Increase
    Media Exposure

    
    
    

    
    
&ldquo;Club
    Stores&rdquo;.



    
    




Our
pricing strategy focuses on being competitively priced with other premium brands. Since our products are positioned in the authentic
premium prepared food category
 we maintain prices competitive with those of similar products and prices slightly higher than
those in the commodity prepared foods section. This pricing strategy also provides greater long-term flexibility as we grow our
product line through the growth curve of our products. Current typical retail prices for 16 oz. packages range from $5.99 to $9.99
and $5.99 to $9.99 per pound for prepared food products sold to delis or hot bars. Increases in raw materials costs
 among other
factors
 may lead to us consider price increases in the future.



As
of January 31
 2019
 approximately 90% of our products are internally produced by the Company&rsquo;s wholly-owned subsidiary
Joseph Epstein Food Enterprises
 Inc (&ldquo;JEFE&rdquo;). Approximately 10% are manufactured on an outsourced basis. None of
our raw materials or ingredients are directly grown or produced by us. From time-to-time we negotiate with other manufacturers
to supplement the Company&rsquo;s manufacturing capability. We currently purchase modest quantities from other manufacturers.
All of the raw materials and ingredients in our products are readily available and are readily ascertainable by our suppliers.
We have not experienced any material shortages of ingredients or other products necessary to our operations and do not anticipate
such shortages in the foreseeable future.



Our
products are sold primarily through a commission broker network. We sell to large retail chains who direct our products to their
own warehouses or to large food distributors.

The
Company increased its sales management efforts with the result that the Company is now actively soliciting business with almost
every major retail supermarket chain in the country. MamaMancini&rsquo;s products are currently sold nationwide
 with its greatest
concentration in the Northeast and Southeast. In April 2019
 the Company initiated a major sales effort into the food service
convenience store
 export and special projects areas.



The
majority of our marketing activity has been generated through promotional discounts
 consumer trial
 consumer product tastings
and demonstrations
 in-store merchandising and signage
 couponing
 word of mouth
 consumer public relations
 social media
 special
merchandising events with retailers and consumer advertising.


Based
on the Company&rsquo;s metrics for determining brand awareness
 which includes market studies and analysis of consumer recognition
of the MamaMancini&rsquo;s brand
 the Company believes that brand awareness for MamaMancini&rsquo;s has grown in the past 12 months.


    
    


Investments
- Meatball Obsession

During
2011 the Company acquired a 34.62% interest in Meatball Obsession
 LLC (&ldquo;MO&rdquo;) for a total investment of $27
032. This
investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly
 investments are recorded at acquisition cost plus
the Company&rsquo;s equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the entity. At December 31
 2011 the investment was written
down to $0 due to losses incurred by MO. The Company&rsquo;s ownership interest in MO has decreased due to dilution. At January
31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company&rsquo;s ownership interest in MO was 12% and 12%
 respectively. One of our directors
 Steven Burns
serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Meatball Obsession.



The
gourmet and specialty pre-packaged and frozen food industry has many large competitors specializing in various types of cuisine
from all over the world. Our product lines are currently concentrated on Italian specialty foods. While it is our contention that
our competition is much more limited than the entire frozen and pre-packaged food industry based on our products&rsquo; niche
market
 there can be no assurances that we do not compete with the entire frozen and pre-packaged food industry. We believe our
principal competitors include Quaker Maid / Philly-Gourmet Meat Company
 Hormel
 Rosina Company
 Inc.
 Casa Di Bertacchi
 Inc.
Farm Rich
 Inc.
 Mama Lucia
 and Buona Vita
 Inc.

Intellectual
Property

Our
current intellectual property consists of trade secret recipes and cooking processes for our products and three trademarks for
&ldquo;MamaMancini&rsquo;s&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Mac N&rsquo; Mamas&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Meatball Lovers Meatball&rdquo;. The recipes
and use of the trademarks have been assigned in perpetuity to the Company.

We
rely on a combination of trademark
 copyright and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We will also
use technical measures to protect our proprietary rights.

Royalty
Agreement

In
accordance with a Development and License Agreement (the &ldquo;Development and License Agreement&rdquo;) entered into on January
1
 2009 with Dan Dougherty relating to the use of his grandmother&rsquo;s recipes for the products to be created by MamaMancini&rsquo;s
Mr. Dougherty granted us a 50-year exclusive license (subject to certain minimum payments being made)
 with a 25-year extension
option
 to use and commercialize the licensed items. Under the terms of the Development and License Agreement
 Mr. Dougherty shall
develop a line of beef meatballs with sauce

distribution and sale (each a &ldquo;Licensor Product&rdquo; and collectively the &ldquo;Licensor Products&rdquo;). Mr. Dougherty
shall work with us to develop Licensor Products that are acceptable to us. Upon acceptance of a Licensor Product by us
 Mr. Dougherty&rsquo;s
trade secret recipes
 formulas methods and ingredients for the preparation and production of such Licensor Products shall be subject

USDA
approval / Regulations

Our
food products
 which are manufactured both in our own manufacturing facilities and in third-party facilities
 are subject to various
federal
 state and local regulations and inspection
 and to extensive regulations and inspections
 regarding sanitation
 quality
packaging and labeling. In order to distribute and sell our products outside the State of New Jersey
 the third-party food processing
facilities must meet the standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the &ldquo;USDA&rdquo;). Our manufacturing
processing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal
 state
 and local authorities. In January 2011
the FDA&rsquo;s Food Safety Modernization Act was signed into law. The law will increase the number of inspections at food facilities
in the U.S. in an effort to enhance the detection of food borne illness outbreaks and order recalls of tainted food products.
The facilities in which our products are manufactured are inspected regularly and comply with all the requirements of the FDA
and USDA.

We
are subject to the Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory
program governs
 among other things
 the manufacturing
 composition and ingredients
 packaging
 and safety of food. Under this
program
 the FDA regulates manufacturing practices for foods through
 among other things
 its current &ldquo;good manufacturing
practices&rdquo; regulations
 or GMP&rsquo;s
 and specifies the recipes for certain foods. Specifically
 the USDA defines &ldquo;all
natural&rdquo; as a product that contains no artificial ingredients
 coloring ingredients or chemical preservatives and is minimally
processed. The Company&rsquo;s products were submitted to the USDA and approved as &ldquo;all natural&rdquo;. However
 should
the USDA change their definition of &ldquo;all natural&rdquo; at some point in the future
 or should MamaMancini&rsquo;s change
their existing recipes to include ingredients that do not meet the USDA&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;all natural&rdquo;
 our results
of operations could be adversely affected.

The
FTC and other authorities regulate how we market and advertise our products
 and we are currently in compliance with all regulations
related thereto
 although we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal and
state laws and regulations. Changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase
the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions
 causing our results of operations to
be adversely affected.

Quality
Assurance

We
take precautions designed to ensure the quality and safety of our products. In addition to routine third-party inspections of
our manufacturing facilities
 we have instituted regular audits to address topics such as allergen control
 ingredient
 packaging
and product specifications and sanitation. Under the FDA Food Modernization Act
 both our own manufacturing facilities and each
of our contract manufacturers are required to have a hazard analysis critical control points plan that identifies critical pathways
for contaminants and mandates control measures that must be used to prevent
 eliminate or reduce relevant food-borne hazards.

Our
manufacturing facility is certified in the Safe Quality Food Program. These standards are integrated food safety and quality management
protocols designed specifically for the food sector and offer a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and quality simultaneously.
Certification provides an independent and external validation that a product
 process or service complies with applicable regulations
and standards.


    
    


We
work with suppliers who assure the quality and safety of their ingredients. These assurances are supported by our purchasing contracts
or quality assurance specification packets
 including affidavits
 certificates of analysis and analytical testing
 where required.
The quality assurance staff within our manufacturing facility and of both our contract manufacturers conduct periodic on-site
routine audits of critical ingredient suppliers.

For
the year ended January 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company reported a net income of $550
048 and $319
740
 respectively. The
change in net income between the year ended January 31
 2019 and 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of 4%.

Sales:

 net of slotting fees and discounts increased by approximately 4% to $28
522
112 during the year ended January 31
 2019
from $27
543
335 during the year ended January 31
During
the year ended January 31
 2019
 the Company was able to increase its sales through new customers as well as its existing customer
base. A merchandising event with one customer during the year ended January 31
 2019 also contributed to the increase in sales.

Gross
Profit: 
 2019 compared to 34% for the year ended January
31
 2018. The increase in gross profit margin is attributable to manufacturing efficiencies and cost control. During the
year ended January 31
 2019
 cost of sales included an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $300
000 (representing
approximately 1% of sales) related to the significant plant additions during the period. The Company believes its gross
margin as a percentage of sales will increase in future operating periods due to more efficient operations.

Operating
Expenses: 
 2019
 as compared to the year ended
January 31
 2018. The increase in total operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following approximate increases in
operating expenses:



    
Payroll
    and related expenses of $160
199;

    
    

    
Postage
    and freight of $290
302 due to higher charges from freight carriers; and

    
    

    
Director
    fees of $33
992.



    
    


These
expense increases were offset by decreases in the following as well as minimal decreases in other expense categories:



    
Stock-based
    compensation for services rendered by employees and consultants decreased by $46
247 compared to the prior year; and

    
    

    
Advertising
    social media and promotional expenses of $44
491 related to a change in customer mix.


Other
Expense:
614 to $1
015
016 for the year ended January 31
 2019 as compared to $743
402
during the year ended January 31
 2018. For year ended January 31
 2019
 other expenses consisted of $881
702 in interest
expense incurred on the Company&rsquo;s financing arrangements. In addition
 the Company recorded $133
314 of amortization
expense related to the debt discount. For the year ended January 31
 2018
 other expenses consisted of $679
974 in interest expense
incurred on the Company&rsquo;s finance arrangements. In addition
 the Company recorded $63
428 of amortization expense related
to the debt discount and finance arrangements.

903
409 as of
January 31
 2018
 an increase of $4
147
296. The increase in working capital deficit is primarily attributable to an increase
in cash balances of approximately $28
100
 an increase in inventories of $572
100
 a decrease in accounts payable
and accrued expenses of approximately $395
000 and an approximate $3
645
000 decrease in the current portion of debt. These
amounts were offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $386
200 and a decrease in prepaid expenses of $106
800.

Net
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended January 31
 2019 and 2018 was $1
443
408 and $1
315
500
 respectively.
The net income for the year ended January 31
 2019 and 2018 was $550

 respectively.

Net
cash used in all investing activities for the year ended January 31
 2019 was $1
033
724 as compared to $1
474
816 for the year
ended January 31
 2018
 respectively
 to acquire new machinery and equipment and leasehold improvements. Our capital expenditures
are attributed to a Plant Expansion Project in progress since mid-2017 to expand plant capacity and efficiency to meet growing
demand.

Net
cash used by all financing activities for the year ended January 31
 2019 was $381
597 as compared to $69
831 provided by financing
activities for the year ended January 31
 2018. During the year ended January 31
 2019
 the Company received proceeds of $40
000
received from the exercise of options
 proceeds of $213
250 from capital-leaseback transactions and proceeds of $2.8 million from
the term loan. These net proceeds were offset by $7
812 of repayments on a related party notes payable
 repayment of notes payable
totaling $2
130
625
 $120
446 for payment of debt issuance costs
 net repayments of the line of credit of $90
356
 payments of
term loan of $1
058
615 and $26
993 paid for capital lease payments. During the year ended January 31
 2018
 the Company had net
borrowings increase of $1
339
245 and $251
671 for transactions pursuant to the line of credit and term loan
 respectively. These
borrowings were offset by $146
388 and $1
350
000 paid for repayments on a term loan and net payments of the note payable to Manatuck
Hill Partners
 respectively.


    
    


As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
 the Company has a net income and net cash provided by operations
of $550
048 and $1
443
408
 respectively
 for the year ended January 31
 2019.

Although
the continued revenue growth coupled with improved gross margins and control of expenses leads management to believe that it is
probable that the Company&rsquo;s cash resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through the fiscal year ending
January 31
 2020
 the Company may require additional funding to finance the growth of its current and expected future operations
as well as to achieve its strategic objectives. table to the Company
 if at all. In that event
 the Company would be required
to change its growth strategy and seek funding on that basis
 though there is no guarantee it will be able to do so.

fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The Company
plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and plans to utilize the transition option which
does not require application of the guidance to comparative periods in the year of adoption. While the Company continues to evaluate
this standard and the effect on related disclosures
 the primary effect of adoption will be recording right-of-use assets and
corresponding lease obligations for current operating leases. The adoption is expected to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s
consolidated balance sheets
 but not on the consolidated statements of income or cash flows. However
 the ultimate impact of adopting
ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company&rsquo;s lease portfolio as of the adoption date. Additionally
 the Company is in the process
of reviewing current accounting policies

In
July 2017

 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic
480) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; II. Replacement
of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception&rdquo;
for certain financial instruments with down round features. Down round features are features of certain equity-linked instruments
(or embedded features) that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. Current
accounting guidance creates cost and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible
instruments) with down round features that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. Part
II of this update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480
 
 because of
the existence of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of
the indefinite deferral of accounting requirements about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities
and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The amendments in Part II of this update do not have an accounting
effect. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those years
 beginning after December 15
 2018.

June 2018
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-07

value non-employee awards differently from employee awards. Companies will value all equity classified awards at their grant-date
under ASC 718 and forgo revaluing the award after the grant date. ASU 2018-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15
 2018
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted
 but no
earlier than the Company&rsquo;s adoption date of Topic 606

under &ldquo;Revenue Recognition&rdquo;). The Company does not believe the new standard will have a significant impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

most important to users of each entity&rsquo;s financial statements. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that
are required
 under existing U.S. GAAP
 to make disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements. The amendments
in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements.

Management
does not believe that any recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncements
 when adopted
 will have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Critical
Accounting Policies

Our
consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions
 judgments and subjective
interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expense amounts reported.
These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding
contingencies
 risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP
and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.

Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements. While all these significant
accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations
 we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies
determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management
to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that
given current facts and circumstances
 it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would
cause effect on our consolidated results of operations
 financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies and procedures
 among others
 affect our more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Such estimates and assumptions impact
 among others
 the following: allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventory obsolescence
and the fair value of share-based payments.

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect
of a condition
 situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements
 which management
considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly
the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.


    
    


Stock-Based
Compensation

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718


It defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts
for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718.

The
Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments
 including stock option grants
 warrants and restricted stock grants
 at
their fair value on the grant date
 which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.

Share-based
payments
 excluding restricted stock
 are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of share-based payment awards
issued to non-employees for services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the share-based payment
 which is the more
readily determinable value. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods
 which is generally
the vesting period. If an award is granted
 but vesting does not occur
 any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed
in the period related to the termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling
general and administrative expenses
 depending on the nature of the services provided
 in the consolidated statement of operations.
Share-based payments issued to placement agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded as a reduction
in additional paid in capital.

When
computing fair value of share-based payments
 the Company has considered the following variables:



    
The
    risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the
    option in effect at the time of the grant.

    
    

    
The
    Company has not paid any dividends on common stock since its inception and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common
    stock in the foreseeable future.

    
    

    
The
    expected option term is computed using the &ldquo;simplified&rdquo; method as permitted under the provisions of Staff Accounting
    Bulletin (&ldquo;SAB&rdquo;) 110.

    
    

    
The
    term is the life of the grant.

    
    

    
The
    expected volatility was estimated using the historical volatilities of the Company&rsquo;s common stock.

    
    

    
The
    forfeiture rate is based on the historical forfeiture rate for the Company&rsquo;s unvested stock options
 which was 0%.


Revenue
Recognition

In
May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue
recognition requirements under Topic 605
 
 and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry
Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. Under the new guidance
 an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the
contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4)
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
 and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity
satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices
across entities
 industries
 jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally
 the guidance requires improved disclosures as to
the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12

from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&mdash;Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients
the objectives of collectability
 sales and other taxes
 noncash consideration
 contract modifications at transition
 completed
contracts at transition and technical correction. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. In September
2017
 the FASB issued additional amendments providing clarification and implementation guidance.


    
    


The
Company adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2019
 applying the full retrospective transition
method. As the underlying principles of the new standard
 relating to the measurement of revenue and the timing of recognition
are closely aligned with the Company&rsquo;s current business model and practices
 the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In addition
 the adoption of ASC 606 did not impact the previously reported
financial statements in any prior period nor did it result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.

The
Company&rsquo;s sales predominantly are generated from the sale of finished products to customers
 contain a single performance
obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership
 risks and rewards transfer. Typically
 this occurs
when the goods are shipped to the customer. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company
expects to receive in exchange for the goods. The Company reports all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue.
Under the new revenue guidance
 the Company elected to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities
 and the
related costs are recorded as selling expenses in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.



Costs
incurred for producing and communicating advertising for the Company are charged to operations as incurred.

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements

(a)
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in report that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)
MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

This
Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure
controls. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 the Company&rsquo;s
principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 and effected by the issuer&rsquo;s
board of directors
 management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and includes those policies and procedures that:


    
    




    
Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the assets of the issuer;

    
    

    
Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the registrant; and

    
    

    
Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the issuer&rsquo;s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 is appropriately recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the specified time periods.

Management
has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31
 2019
 based
on the framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;).

Based
on this assessment
 management concluded that as of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 it had material weaknesses
in its internal control procedures.

As
of period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
ineffective. The Company&rsquo;s assessment identified certain material weaknesses which are set forth below:

Functional
Controls and Segregation of Duties

Because
of the Company&rsquo;s limited resources
 there are limited controls over information processing.

There
is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company&rsquo;s management is composed of a small
number of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation
we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently
 it is not feasible to hire additional
staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether
improvement in segregation of duty is feasible.

Accordingly
as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis by the Company&rsquo;s internal controls.

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our
small size. Management believes these weaknesses did not have a material effect on our financial results and intends to take remedial
actions upon receiving funding for the Company&rsquo;s business operations.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management&rsquo;s report herein.

(c)
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We
are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment
 we will create a position to segregate duties
consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting
function when funds are available to us by preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set
forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure
requirements.


    
    


Management
believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the material weaknesses pertaining
to insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.

We
intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these deficiencies
 including:



    
We
    will revise processes to provide for a greater role of independent board members in the oversight and review until such time
    that we are adequately capitalized to permit hiring additional personnel to address segregation of duties issues
 ineffective
    controls over the revenue cycle and insufficient supervision and review by our corporate management.

    
    

    
We
    will update the documentation of our internal control processes
 including formal risk assessment of our financial reporting
    processes.


We
intend to consider the results of our remediation efforts and related testing as part of our year-end 2019 assessment of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting.

Subsequent
to January 31
 2019
 we intend to continue to undertake the following steps to address the deficiencies stated above:



    
    
Continued
    the development and documentation of internal controls and procedures surrounding the financial reporting process
 primarily
    through the use of account reconciliations
 and supervision.

    
    
    

    
    
Added
    additional accounting staff to further segregate duties and help the Company maintain timely reporting of financial results.

Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics

Effective
January 21
 2014
 the Board of Directors (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) of MamaMancini&rsquo;s Holdings
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
adopted a Code of Ethics (the &ldquo;Code of Ethics&rdquo;) applicable to the Company and all subsidiaries and entities controlled
by the Company and the Company&rsquo;s directors
 officers and employees. Compliance with the Code of Ethics is required of all
Company personnel at all times. The Company&rsquo;s senior management is charged with ensuring that the Code of Ethics and the
Company&rsquo;s corporate policies will govern
 without exception
 all business activities of the Company. The Code of Ethics
addresses
 among other things
 the use and protection of Company assets and information
 avoiding conflicts of interest
 corporate
opportunities and transactions with business associates and document retention.

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings

During
the past five years no director
 person nominated to become a director
 executive officer
 promoter or control person of the Company
has: (i) had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive
officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (ii) been convicted in a criminal proceeding
or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (iii) been subject to
any order
 judgment
 or decree
 not subsequently reversed
 suspended or vacated

activities; or (iv) been found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action)
 the Commission or the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law
 and the judgment has not been reversed
suspended
 or vacated.

Compliance
with Section 16(A) of the Exchange Act

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company&rsquo;s directors
 executive officers and persons who beneficially own 10% or more
of a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in
beneficial ownership with the SEC. Directors
 executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders are required by the rules and
regulations of the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all reports filed by them in compliance with Section 16(a).

Based
solely on our review of certain reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 the reports required to be filed with respect to transactions in our common stock during the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 were timely.

Legal
Proceedings

There
are no material proceedings to which any director or officer
 or any associate of any such director or officer
 is a party that
is adverse to our Company or any of our subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to our Company or any of our subsidiaries.
No director or executive officer has been a director or executive officer of any business which has filed a bankruptcy petition
or had a bankruptcy petition filed against it during the past ten years. No director or executive officer has been convicted of
a criminal offense or is the subject of a pending criminal proceeding during the past ten years. No director or executive officer
has been the subject of any order
 judgment or decree of any court permanently or temporarily enjoining
 barring
 suspending or
otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business
 securities or banking activities during the past ten years. No director
or officer has been found by a court to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law during the past ten years.

Manatuck
Debenture

On
December 19
 2014
 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the &ldquo;Manatuck Purchase Agreement&rdquo;) with
Manatuck Hill Partners
 LLC (&ldquo;Manatuck&rdquo;) whereby the Company issued a convertible redeemable debenture (the &ldquo;Manatuck
Debenture&rdquo;) in favor of Manatuck. Subsequent to issuance
 the note was amended to extend the maturity date and also removed
the convertible feature of the note. On January 22
 2018
 the Company further extended the maturity date to November 1
 2018.

On
July 17
 2018
 the Company further extended the maturity date to May 1
 2019. The Company paid to Manatuck a cash fee equal to
two percent (2%) of the mutually-agreed pro-forma balance payable on account of the note as of July 17
 2018
 which shall include
all interest which would be accrued on the note through July 17
 2018. Total accrued interest of $392
702 was added to the outstanding
principal balance as of the extension date. The 2% fee was expensed in accordance with debt extinguishment accounting.

On
January 4
 2019
 the Manatuck Debenture was fully repaid and retired in lieu of a payment in the amount of $1
199
288.

M&amp;T
Bank Facility

Effective
January 4
 2019
 the Company arranged a new $3.5 million working capital line of credit with M&amp;T Bank at LIBOR plus four points
with a two-year expiration. The Company also arranged a $2.5 million five-year note with M&amp;T Bank at LIBOR plus four points
with repayments in equal payments over 60 months. The new financing replaces the Company&rsquo;s existing Senior Note from Manatuck
Hill Partners (which was due on May 1
 2019) in the amount of approximately $1.2 million; working capital and term loans in the
amount of approximately $2.8 million payable to EGC and a $250
000 term loan payable to Valley National Bank. Advances under the
line of credit are limited to eighty percent (80%) of eligible accounts receivable (which is subject to an agreed limitation and
is further subject to certain asset concentration provisions) and fifty percent (50%) of eligible inventory (which is subject
to an agreed dollar limitation). The new facility is supported by a first priority security interest in all of the Company&rsquo;s
business assets and is further subject to various affirmative and negative financial covenants and a limited Guaranty by the Company&rsquo;s
Chief executive Officer
 Carl Wolf.

The
effect of the financing as well as an amendment to certain related party financing to notes maturing January 2024 is to
reclassify approximately $3.4 million from short-term liabilities to long-term loans. The Company estimates it initially will
be paying a 6.5% per annum interest rate on the new financing
 versus an average of over 12.5% per annum on the prior financing
it replaces. The Company estimates that it will initially reduce its monthly interest and related fees by approximately $33
000
as well as initially improving its monthly cash flow by $101
000 in interest and related expenses and monthly debt payments.


    
    


The
Company recorded a one-time charge of $121
500 for termination of its existing loans in the month of January and will also amortize
origination fees of $89
000 on the new facility over a 24-month period.

 with a large concentration in
the Northeast and Southeast.

Recent
Developments

On
November 1
 2017
 the Company
 Joseph Epstein Food Enterprises
 Inc.
 a New Jersey corporation (&ldquo;JEFE&rdquo;)
 and MMMB
Acquisition
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&ldquo;Merger Sub&rdquo;)
 completed the merger
contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (&ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;) by and among the Company
 JEFE
 and Merger Sub
dated as of November 1
 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement
 JEFE has merged with and into Merger Sub
 with Merger
Sub continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

Under
the terms of the Merger Agreement and in connection with the merger
 the Company acquired all assets of JEFE. The consideration
for the transaction was (a) the extinguishment of the Inter-Company Loan between the parties
 (b) the assumption by the Company
of all JEFE accounts payable and accrued expenses
 (c) assumption by the Company of certain third-party loans to JEFE and (d)
indemnification of Carl Wolf with respect to his collateralization of a bank loan to JEFE in the amount of approximately $250
000.
As a result of the transaction
 (i) the Company became the sole shareholder of JEFE
 which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company (ii) following the Closing
 JEFE&rsquo;s financial statements as of the Closing are consolidated with the Consolidated
Financial Statements of the Company (collectively
 the &ldquo;Merger Transaction&rdquo;). No cash or stock was exchanged in connection
with the transaction.

In
accordance with the guidance under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805: 
 the Merger transactions
are accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control. The assets and liabilities of JEFE transferred between
entities under common control were recorded by the Company based on JEFE&rsquo;s historical cost basis. The financial statements
of both entities have been combined for all periods presented.

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
of Presentation

The
consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (&ldquo;US GAAP&rdquo;) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the entities as of the reporting period ending date(s) and for the reporting
period(s). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.


    
    



Following
the closing of the merger with Joseph Epstein Food Enterprises
 Inc. (&ldquo;JEFE&rdquo;) on November 1
 2017
 the financial statements
of JEFE are consolidated with that of the Company. The prior period financial statements included in the condensed consolidated
financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this transaction.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Such estimates and assumptions impact
 among others
 the following: allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventory obsolescence
and the fair value of share-based payments.

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect
of a condition
 situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements
 which management
considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly
the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.

Risks
and Uncertainties

The
Company operates in an industry that is subject to intense competition and change in consumer demand. The Company&rsquo;s operations
are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks including the potential risk of business
failure.

The
Company has experienced
 and in the future expects to continue to experience
 variability in sales and earnings. The factors expected
to contribute to this variability include
 among others
 (i) the cyclical nature of the grocery industry
 (ii) general economic
conditions in the various local markets in which the Company competes
 including a potential general downturn in the economy
and (iii) the volatility of prices pertaining to food and beverages in connection with the Company&rsquo;s distribution of the
product. These factors
 among others
 make it difficult to project the Company&rsquo;s operating results on a consistent basis.



The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company held no cash equivalents at January 31
 2019 and 2018.

The
Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial
institution. The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company generally does not require
collateral to support customer receivables. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the
outstanding accounts receivable
 historical collection information and existing economic conditions. The Company determines if
receivables are past due based on days outstanding
 and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible by management.
The maximum accounting loss from the credit risk associated with accounts receivable is the amount of the receivable recorded
which is the face amount of the receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of January 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company
had reserves of $2
000.



Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) valuation method. Inventory was comprised
of the following at January 31
 2019 and 2018:

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives.

Asset
lives for financial statement reporting of depreciation are:



Machinery
    and equipment
2-7
                                         years 

Furniture

(*)
Amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives
 whichever period is shorter.

Upon
sale or retirement of property and equipment
 the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

For
purpose of this disclosure
 the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties
 other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The carrying amount of the Company&rsquo;s
short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.

Research
and Development

Research
and development is expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses for the years ended January 31
 2019 and 2018 were
$130
920 and $138
000
 respectively.

Shipping
and Handling Costs

The
Company classifies freight billed to customers as sales revenue and the related freight costs as general and administrative expenses.

Revenue
Recognition

In
May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue
recognition requirements under Topic 605
 
 and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry
Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. Under the new guidance
 an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the
contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4)
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
 and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity
satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices
across entities
 industries
 jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally
 the guidance requires improved disclosures as to
the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12

from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&mdash;Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients
the objectives of collectability
 sales and other taxes
 noncash consideration
 contract modifications at transition
 completed
contracts at transition and technical correction. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. In September
2017
 the FASB issued additional amendments providing clarification and implementation guidance.


    
    



The
Company adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2019
 applying the full retrospective transition
method. As the underlying principles of the new standard
 relating to the measurement of revenue and the timing of recognition
are closely aligned with the Company&rsquo;s current business model and practices
 the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In addition
 the adoption of ASC 606 did not impact the previously reported
financial statements in any prior period nor did it result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.

The
Company&rsquo;s sales predominantly are generated from the sale of finished products to customers
 contain a single performance
obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership
 risks and rewards transfer. Typically
 this occurs
when the goods are shipped to the customer. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company
expects to receive in exchange for the goods. The Company reports all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue.
Under the new revenue guidance
 the Company elected to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities
 and the
related costs are recorded as selling expenses in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.

The
Company promotes its products with advertising
 consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include discounts
 slotting
fees
 coupons
 rebates
 in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. Customer trade promotion and consumer incentive
activities are recorded as a reduction to the transaction price based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers
at the end of a period. The Company derives these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. The Company
does not receive a distinct service in relation to the advertising
 consumer incentives and trade promotions.

Payment
terms in the Company&rsquo;s invoices are based on the billing schedule established in contracts and purchase orders with customers.
The Company generally recognizes the related trade receivable when the goods are shipped.

Expenses
such as slotting fees
 sales discounts
 and allowances are accounted for as a direct reduction of revenues as follows:

Cost
of Sales

Cost
of sales represents costs directly related to the production and manufacturing of the Company&rsquo;s products. Costs include
product development
 freight
 packaging
 and print production costs.



Costs
incurred for producing and communicating advertising for the Company are charged to operations as incurred. Producing and communicating
advertising expenses for the years January 31
 2019 and 2018 were $1
729
448 and $1
773
939
 respectively.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718


It defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts
for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718.

The
Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments
 including stock option grants
 warrants and restricted stock grants
 at
their fair value on the grant date
 which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.


    
    



Share-based
payments
 excluding restricted stock
 are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of share-based payment awards
issued to non-employees for services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the share-based payment
 which is the more
readily determinable value. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods
 which is generally
the vesting period. If an award is granted
 but vesting does not occur
 any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed
in the period related to the termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling
general and administrative expenses
 depending on the nature of the services provided
 in the consolidated statement of operations.
Share-based payments issued to placement agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded as a reduction
in additional paid in capital.

For
the years ended January 31
 2019 and 2018
 share-based compensation amounted to $162
494 and $428
240
 respectively.

For
the years ended January 31
 2019 and 2018
 when computing fair value of share-based payments
 the Company has considered the following
variables:

                                         to 177 

    
    
    


The
expected option term is computed using the &ldquo;simplified&rdquo; method as permitted under the provisions of ASC 718-10-S99.
The Company uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options and similar instruments as the Company does
not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.

The
expected stock price volatility for the Company&rsquo;s stock options was estimated using the historical volatilities of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock. Risk free interest rates were obtained from U.S. Treasury rates for the applicable periods.

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share

Earnings
per share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience
 the term
is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to Section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16
 basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the
period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred
stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned)
from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation
of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect
the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement
 stock options
or warrants.


    
    


The
following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in computing basic and diluted net income (loss)
attributable to common stockholders per common share.

Income
Taxes

The
Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under FASB ASC 740
.&rdquo;
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established
 when necessary
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

FASB
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized
 a tax position must be more
likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of January
31
 2019. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No
amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at January 31
 2019. The Company is currently not aware of any
issues under review that could result in significant payments
 accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is
subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.

The
Company may be subject to potential examination by federal
 state
 and city taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These
potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions
 the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions
and compliance with federal
 state
 and city tax laws. The Company&rsquo;s management does not expect that the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

The
Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2016.

Related
Parties

The
Company follows subtopic ASC 850-10 for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.

Pursuant
to Section 850-10-20
 the related parties include: (a) affiliates of the Company (&ldquo;Affiliate&rdquo; means
 with respect
to any specified person
 any other person that
 directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries
 controls
 is controlled
by or is under common control with such person
 as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act);
(b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required
 absent the election of the fair value option
under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15
 to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity;
(c) trusts for the benefit of employees
 such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship
of management; (d) principal owners of the Company; (e) management of the Company; (f) other parties with which the Company may
deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that
one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g) other parties that can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in
one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.

sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than twelve months. The new standard is effective for
fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The Company
plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and plans to utilize the transition option which
does not require application of the guidance to comparative periods in the year of adoption. While the Company continues to evaluate
this standard and the effect on related disclosures
 the primary effect of adoption will be recording right-of-use assets and
corresponding lease obligations for current operating leases. The adoption is expected to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s
consolidated balance sheets
 but not on the consolidated statements of income or cash flows. However
 the ultimate impact of adopting
ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company&rsquo;s lease portfolio as of the adoption date. Additionally
 the Company is in the process
of reviewing current accounting policies
 changes to business processes
 systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard.

In
July 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-11

 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic
480) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; II. Replacement
of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception&rdquo;
for certain financial instruments with down round features. Down round features are features of certain equity-linked instruments
(or embedded features) that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. Current
accounting guidance creates cost and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible
instruments) with down round features that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. Part
II of this update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480
 
 because of
the existence of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of
the indefinite deferral of accounting requirements about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities
and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The amendments in Part II of this update do not have an accounting
effect. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those years
 beginning after December 15
 2018.

In
June 2018
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-07

 companies will no longer be required to
value non-employee awards differently from employee awards. Companies will value all equity classified awards at their grant-date
under ASC 718 and forgo revaluing the award after the grant date. ASU 2018-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15
 2018
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted
 but no
earlier than the Company&rsquo;s adoption date of Topic 606

under &ldquo;Revenue Recognition&rdquo;). The Company does not believe the new standard will have a significant impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

On
December 22
 2017
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &ldquo;Tax Reform Bill&rdquo;) was signed into law. Prior to the enactment of
the Tax Reform Bill
 the Company measured its deferred tax assets at the federal rate of 34%. The Tax Reform Bill reduced the
federal tax rate to 21% resulting in the re-measurement of the deferred tax asset as of January 31
 2018. Beginning January 1
2018
 the lower tax rate of 21% will be used to calculate the amount of any federal income tax due on taxable income earned during
2019.

The
Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers (NOLs) of approximately $10.8 million and $11.1 million at January
31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 available to offset taxable income through 2034. If not used
 these NOLs may be subject to limitation
under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 should there be a greater than 50% ownership change as determined under the regulations.
The Company plans on undertaking a detailed analysis of any historical and/or current Section 382 ownership changes that may limit
the utilization of the net operating loss carryovers. The Company also has New Jersey State Net Operating Loss carry overs of
$10.0 million and $10.9 million at January 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 available to offset future taxable income through
2035.


    
    


In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future
generation for taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become
deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all the information available
 Management believes that significant
uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation
allowance. For the years ended January 31
 2019 and 2018
 the change in the valuation allowance was $383
948 and $2
188
418
respectively.

The
Company evaluated the provisions of ASC 740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&rsquo;s
financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize
 present
 and disclose uncertain
positions that the Company has taken or expects to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized
 a tax position
must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return and the net benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to
as &ldquo;unrecognized benefits.&rdquo; A liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carry forward or amount of
tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise&rsquo;s potential future obligation
to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740.

If
applicable
 interest costs related to the unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated and would be classified as &ldquo;Other
expenses &ndash; Interest&rdquo; in the statement of operations. Penalties would be recognized as a component of &ldquo;General
and administrative.&rdquo;

No
interest or penalties on unpaid tax were recorded during the years ended January 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. As of January
31
 2019 and 2018
 no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The Company does not expect any significant
changes in its unrecognized tax benefits in the next year.

The
Company&rsquo;s deferred tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the effects of temporary differences attributable to the following:

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue&#13;from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&lt;/i&gt;. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under Topic 605
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue&#13;Recognition&lt;/i&gt;
 and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance&#13;is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that&#13;reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance
&#13;an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance&#13;obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations&#13;in the contract
 and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly&#13;enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities
 industries
 jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally
&#13;the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May&#13;2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&amp;#8212;Narrow-Scope Improvements and&#13;Practical Expedients&lt;/i&gt;. This update clarifies the objectives of collectability

 applying the full retrospective transition method. As the underlying principles&#13;of the new standard
 relating to the measurement of revenue and the timing of recognition
 are closely aligned with the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;current business model and practices
 the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial&#13;statements. In addition

 contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at&#13;a single point in time when ownership
 risks and rewards transfer. Typically
 this occurs when the goods are shipped to the customer.&#13;Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods.&#13;The Company reports all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue. Under the new revenue guidance
 the Company&#13;elected to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities

&#13;consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include discounts
 slotting fees
 coupons
 rebates
 in-store display incentives&#13;and volume-based incentives. Customer trade promotion and consumer incentive activities are recorded as a reduction to the transaction&#13;price based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. The Company derives these estimates&#13;principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. The Company does not receive a distinct service in relation to the&#13;advertising

 including stock option grants
 warrants and restricted stock grants
 at their fair value on the grant date

 excluding restricted&#13;stock
 are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of share-based payment awards issued to non-employees for&#13;services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the share-based payment
 which is the more readily determinable value.&#13;The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods
 which is generally the vesting period. If&#13;an award is granted
 but vesting does not occur
 any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related&#13;to the termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling
 general and administrative&#13;expenses
 depending on the nature of the services provided

 2019 and 2018
&#13;share-based compensation amounted to $162

 the term is used to refer to either earnings or&#13;loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to Section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs&#13;260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16
 basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator)&#13;by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders&#13;shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends&#13;accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that&#13;amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation&#13;of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding&#13;if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from&#13;common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement

 &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Income Taxes&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;#8221; Deferred tax assets and liabilities&#13;are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts&#13;of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using&#13;enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered&#13;or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that&#13;included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established
 when necessary

 a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination&#13;by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31
 2019. The Company recognizes accrued interest&#13;and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and&#13;penalties at January 31
 2019. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments

&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt; which will require recognition on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created&#13;by leases with terms greater than twelve months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those&#13;years beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning&#13;of its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and plans to utilize the transition option which does not require application of the guidance&#13;to comparative periods in the year of adoption. While the Company continues to evaluate this standard and the effect on related&#13;disclosures
 the primary effect of adoption will be recording right-of-use assets and corresponding lease obligations for current&#13;operating leases. The adoption is expected to have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated balance sheets
 but not&#13;on the consolidated statements of income or cash flows. However
 the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the&#13;Company&amp;#8217;s lease portfolio as of the adoption date. Additionally

 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic&#13;815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for&#13;Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests&#13;with a Scope Exception&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;. Part I of this update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments&#13;with down round features. Down round features are features of certain equity-linked instruments (or embedded features) that result&#13;in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. Current accounting guidance creates cost&#13;and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible instruments) with down round features&#13;that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. Part II of this update addresses the difficulty&#13;of navigating Topic 480
 &lt;i&gt;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity&lt;/i&gt;
 because of the existence of extensive pending content in&#13;the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of the indefinite deferral of accounting requirements&#13;about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling&#13;interests. The amendments in Part II of this update do not have an accounting effect. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
 and&#13;interim periods within those years
 beginning after December 15

The amendments in this update apply to all entities that are required

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Revenue&#13;from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&lt;/i&gt;. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under Topic 605
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Revenue&#13;Recognition&lt;/i&gt;
 and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance&#13;is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that&#13;reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance
&#13;an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance&#13;obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations&#13;in the contract
 and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly&#13;enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities
 industries
 jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally
&#13;the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May&#13;2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&amp;#8212;Narrow-Scope Improvements&#13;and Practical Expedients&lt;/i&gt;. This update clarifies the objectives of collectability

 applying the full retrospective transition method. As the underlying&#13;principles of the new standard
 relating to the measurement of revenue and the timing of recognition
 are closely aligned with&#13;the Company&amp;#8217;s current business model and practices
 the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the consolidated&#13;financial statements. In addition

 contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized&#13;at a single point in time when ownership
 risks and rewards transfer. Typically
 this occurs when the goods are shipped to the&#13;customer. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for&#13;the goods. The Company reports all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue. Under the new revenue guidance
&#13;the Company elected to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities

 consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include discounts
 slotting fees
 coupons
 rebates
 in-store&#13;display incentives and volume-based incentives. Customer trade promotion and consumer incentive activities are recorded as a reduction&#13;to the transaction price based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. The Company&#13;derives these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. The Company does not receive a distinct service&#13;in relation to the advertising

 the term is used to refer to either earnings&#13;or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to Section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC&#13;Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16
 basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the&#13;numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to&#13;common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not&#13;paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing&#13;operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar&#13;to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that&#13;would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential&#13;dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement

 &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Income Taxes&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;#8221; Deferred tax assets and liabilities&#13;are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts&#13;of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using&#13;enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered&#13;or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that&#13;included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established
 when necessary

 a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon&#13;examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31
 2019. The Company recognizes accrued&#13;interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest&#13;and penalties at January 31

The Company plans to adopt this guidance&#13;at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2020 and plans to utilize the transition option which does not require application&#13;of the guidance to comparative periods in the year of adoption. While the Company continues to evaluate this standard and the effect&#13;on related disclosures
 the primary effect of adoption will be recording right-of-use assets and corresponding lease obligations&#13;for current operating leases. The adoption is expected to have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated balance sheets
&#13;but not on the consolidated statements of income or cash flows. However
 the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend&#13;on the Company&amp;#8217;s lease portfolio as of the adoption date. Additionally
 the Company is in the process of reviewing current&#13;accounting policies
 changes to business processes

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2016-16
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory&amp;#8221;
&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;which&#13;eliminates the exception that prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income tax effects for intra-entity transfers of&#13;assets other than inventory until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods&#13;beginning after December 15
 2019

 the FASB issued ASU 2017-11
&#13;&amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic&#13;815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for&#13;Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests&#13;with a Scope Exception&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;. Part I of this update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments&#13;with down round features. Down round features are features of certain equity-linked instruments (or embedded features) that result&#13;in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. Current accounting guidance creates cost&#13;and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible instruments) with down round features&#13;that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. Part II of this update addresses the difficulty&#13;of navigating Topic 480
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity&lt;/i&gt;
 because of the existence of extensive pending content&#13;in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of the indefinite deferral of accounting requirements&#13;about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling&#13;interests. The amendments in Part II of this update do not have an accounting effect. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
 and&#13;interim periods within those years
 beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-07
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based&#13;Payment Accounting&lt;/i&gt;. Under the new standard
 companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from&#13;employee awards. Companies will value all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC 718 and forgo revaluing the award&#13;after the grant date. ASU 2018-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim&#13;reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted
 but no earlier than the Company&amp;#8217;s adoption date&#13;of Topic 606

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2018-13
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework&amp;#8212;Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for&#13;Fair Value Measurement&amp;#8221;.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;This update is to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to the financial&#13;statements by facilitating clear communication of the information required by U.S. GAAP that is most important to users of each&#13;entity&amp;#8217;s financial statements. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that are required
 under existing U.S.&#13;GAAP
 to make disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements. The amendments in this update are effective&#13;for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15

 the Tax Cuts and Jobs&#13;Act (the &amp;#8220;Tax Reform Bill&amp;#8221;) was signed into law. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Reform Bill
 the Company measured&#13;its deferred tax assets at the federal rate of 34%. The Tax Reform Bill reduced the federal tax rate to 21% resulting in the re-measurement&#13;of the deferred tax asset as of January 31
 2018. Beginning January 1

 available to&#13;offset taxable income through 2034. If not used
 these NOLs may be subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382&#13;should there be a greater than 50% ownership change as determined under the regulations. The Company plans on undertaking a detailed&#13;analysis of any historical and/or current Section 382 ownership changes that may limit the utilization of the net operating loss&#13;carryovers. The Company also has New Jersey State Net Operating Loss carry overs of $10.0 million and $10.9 million at January&#13;31

 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be&#13;realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future generation for taxable income during the periods&#13;in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled&#13;reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After&#13;consideration of all the information available
 Management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future&#13;realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the years ended January 31
&#13;2019 and 2018
 the change in the valuation allowance was $383

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies




notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;US

 the financial statements of JEFE are consolidated with
that of the Company. The prior period financial statements included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been
adjusted to reflect this transaction.

 variability in sales and earnings. The factors expected to contribute to this variability include
among others
 (i) the cyclical nature of the grocery industry
 (ii) general economic conditions in the various local markets in
which the Company competes
 including a potential general downturn in the economy
 and (iii) the volatility of prices pertaining
to food and beverages in connection with the Company&#8217;s distribution of the product. These factors

with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution. The balance at times may exceed federally
insured limits.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts


management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company generally does not require collateral to support customer
receivables. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable
historical collection information and existing economic conditions. The Company determines if receivables are past due based on
days outstanding
 and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible by management. The maximum accounting loss from
the credit risk associated with accounts receivable is the amount of the receivable recorded
 which is the face amount of the receivable
net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of January 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had reserves of $2

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09

from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

Recognition
 and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance
is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance
an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract
 and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly
enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities
 industries
 jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally
the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May
2016

 applying the full retrospective transition method. As the underlying principles
of the new standard
 relating to the measurement of revenue and the timing of recognition
 are closely aligned with the Company&#8217;s
current business model and practices
 the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements. In addition
 the adoption of ASC 606 did not impact the previously reported financial statements in any prior period
nor did it result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.

 this occurs when the goods are shipped to the customer.
Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods.
The Company reports all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue. Under the new revenue guidance

 are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of share-based payment awards issued to non-employees for
services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the share-based payment
 which is the more readily determinable value.
The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods
 which is generally the vesting period. If
an award is granted
 but vesting does not occur
 any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related
to the termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling
 general and administrative
expenses
 depending on the nature of the services provided
 in the consolidated statement of operations. Share-based payments issued
to placement agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital.


 2019 and 2018
share-based compensation amounted to $162
494 and $428
240
 respectively.


 2019 and 2018

 the term is used to refer to either earnings or
loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to Section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs
260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16
 basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator)
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders
shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends
accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that
amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation
of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from
common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement

 2017
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the &#8220;Tax Reform Bill&#8221;) was signed into law. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Reform Bill
 the Company measured
its deferred tax assets at the federal rate of 34%. The Tax Reform Bill reduced the federal tax rate to 21% resulting in the re-measurement
of the deferred tax asset as of January 31
 2018. Beginning January 1
 2018
 the lower tax rate of 21% will be used to calculate
the amount of any federal income tax due on taxable income earned during 2019.


loss carryovers (NOLs) of approximately $10.8 million and $11.1 million at January 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 available to
offset taxable income through 2034. If not used
 these NOLs may be subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382
should there be a greater than 50% ownership change as determined under the regulations. The Company plans on undertaking a detailed
analysis of any historical and/or current Section 382 ownership changes that may limit the utilization of the net operating loss
carryovers. The Company also has New Jersey State Net Operating Loss carry overs of $10.0 million and $10.9 million at January
31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 available to offset future taxable income through 2035.


assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future generation for taxable income during the periods
in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After
consideration of all the information available
 Management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future
realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the years ended January 31
2019 and 2018
 the change in the valuation allowance was $383
948 and $2
188
418
 respectively.


740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#8217;s financial statements. ASC 740
prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize
 present
 and disclose uncertain positions that the Company
has taken or expects to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized
 a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return and the net benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as &#8220;unrecognized benefits.&#8221;
A liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carry forward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized
tax benefit because it represents an enterprise&#8217;s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position
that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740.


 interest costs related to the
unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated and would be classified as &#8220;Other expenses &#8211; Interest&#8221;
in the statement of operations. Penalties would be recognized as a component of &#8220;General and administrative.&#8221;


recorded during the years ended January 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. As of January 31
 2019 and 2018
 no liability for unrecognized
tax benefits was required to be reported. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits
in the next year.

Recognition
 and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance
is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance
an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract
 and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly
enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities
 industries
 jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally
the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May
2016

principles of the new standard
 relating to the measurement of revenue and the timing of recognition
 are closely aligned with
the Company&#8217;s current business model and practices
 the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the consolidated

 the adoption of ASC 606 did not impact the previously reported financial statements in any prior

at a single point in time when ownership

 this occurs when the goods are shipped to the
customer. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for
the goods. The Company reports all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue. Under the new revenue guidance
the Company elected to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities
 and the related costs are recorded as
selling expenses in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.

derives these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. The Company does not receive a distinct service

 the term is used to refer to either earnings

Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16
 basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the
numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to
common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not
paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing
operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar
to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential
dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement

 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.

That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
